Ok I'm putting this in writing now:
Arch wizards do not HAVE to register second characters, however
it is preferred that they do.
Arch wizards from sites under registration obviously still have
to register their seconds.

Arch wizards may not affect their second characters in ANY WAY!
Disobeying this rule may lead to permanent demotion.

Questions to the incumbant head of Law.
