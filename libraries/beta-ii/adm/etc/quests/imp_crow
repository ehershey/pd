The Impslayer Quest is intended to be for Newbies, Levels 1-6
It is intended to be quite difficult, but appropriate, for the level. It is
not a give away quest. The Quest hint will be "Destroy the Imperial Crown of
Simplicity" and throughout the realm there are many hints which imply that
all is not well in this royal realm and that Imperial the ruler of Simplicity
should be killed.  There are also hints which indicate that a special sword,
the Implslayer, is required to remove the corrupt monarch.
To do this, the player needs to do the following:
Discover all 3 fragments of the Impslayer, these are held by the following:
Impale (i17.c) has the blade, Important (i25.c) has the pommel, disguised as
a paperweight, and Imperceptible (i28.c) has the hilt.
To join all 3 fragmeents the player needs to hit the anvil in the deserted
smithy (i22.c) with the hammer (i15.c) This process will create the Impslayer
which has a very high weapon class against Imperial (i16.c)
Imperial has a crown and it must be taken to the pool of acid (i27.c) and
dissolved, thus killing off the monarchy. (i27.c) set's the quest for the
player.
