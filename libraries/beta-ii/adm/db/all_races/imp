help physical
Imps are small demonic creatures that are extremely intelligent and
quite ugly. They stand only half a meter in size and have a similar
wingspan. Imps are usually red, green, blue or black in color with
glistening black claws and teeth. Their eyes are usually a dark crimson
with orange-yellow irises. Imps are quite swift.

help racial
The imps of Primal Darkness are a race of despicable, foul-mouthed
know-it-alls. The imps presence in the realms is usually the product of a
weak spellcaster who was murdered after attempting to control the imp.
Imps are extremely intelligent and have a hard time resisting any test
of their knowledge.
