help physical
Saurans are extremely massive and powerfully built. Most stand over
two meters tall and some even reach three meters. Their skin tones
are green, red, black, blue and occassionally white or gold. Overall they
appear as dragon-men with protruding horns and a medium length tail.
They have remarkable movement for their size but are exceptionally 
vunerable to magic due to their often low wisdom.

help racial
The saurans of Primal Darkness are a stern race often with little humor.
They tend to excel in professions of war and protection. While very
intelligent, saurans have a knack for making themselves appear dimwitted
due to thier enormous size and often slow response to a good joke. 
Saurans are generally peaceful but few exceed their ability to fight.
