hyena and man. Most are near 2 meters tall and have thick, short,
spotted fur that covers their entire body. Gnoll eye colors

The gnolls of Primal Darkness have a long and dark history that
began on the island of Merkkirri. Most have been corrupted by
evil and are content with a life of plunder and dark worship.
However, many have ventured beyond their jungle confines in
search of a better life.
