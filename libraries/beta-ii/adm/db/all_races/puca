help physical
Pucas stand about a meter tall and tend to be covered in short fur.
They have elongated ears similar to small animals and their faces
are very animal-like as well, with sizeable noses and eyes.
Most pucas have dark colorings and bright yellow or green eyes.
They have long legs for their height and can run very quickly.
All pucas have a long tail with which they can hold things, like a monkey can.

help racial
A puca is a mischievious soul. They delight in confusing and sometimes
scaring others whenever possible, but usually do not harm anyone.
Pucas do not take well to organized government and law, so they
usually wander free on their own, finding enjoyment in their adventures.
