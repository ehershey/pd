help physical
Satyrs have the upper torso, head, and arms of a man, and the lower body of
a goat. Their legs are usually covered in brown or black fur. In place of
feet, they have hooves. Adult satyrs have two small horns on their heads,
which range from very short nubs to decorative curls. They are fairly fast
and not of slight build, though they tend away from the scholarly arts.

help racial
Most satyrs prefer to socialize with anyone they find friendly.
Satyrs themselves are considered some of the most entertaining people around
despite their odd appearance. They tend to indulge their passions whenever
possible, which usually involves a large gathering and a lot of drinking.
Those who seek adventure often do so in search of others with whom to carouse.
