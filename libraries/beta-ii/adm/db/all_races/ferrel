help physical
Ferrels stand nearly 2 meters in height when upright but tend to hunch
rather heavily. Humans would say they appear as a cross between rodent
and man but that is far from exact. Their faces however bear a striking
resemblance to the common field mouse and long furless tails do nothing to
dismiss the comparisons.

help racial
The ferrels of Primal Darkness are as inquisitive as they are agile to which
few if any are their equals. Ferrels are by nature extremely self-serving
and most make a living as a con artist or petty thief. The great ones
however are among the best jesters, bards, and assassins in the realm.
