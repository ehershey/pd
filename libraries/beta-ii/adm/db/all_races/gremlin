help physical
Gremlins are hideously ugly denizens of small size but incredible
strength. They rarely stand over a meter in height and have incredible
natural agility. Gremlin skin is always green and usually marked by
streaks or patches of hair. They have glowing yellow eyes and two
separate rows of teeth. They are not known for being bright but have
a high mental affinity and thus are quite familiar with magic.

help racial
The gremlins of Primal Darkness are the result of a magical spell or
mishap that brought the creature from the nightmare dimension. They
are insanely wicked and have little concept of remorse or even 'looking
back'. Most stalk the world in search of trouble and await the day
Asmodeus wins the war.
