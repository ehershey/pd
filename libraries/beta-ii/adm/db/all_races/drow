Drows are dark elves, banished long ago by their cousins. Their skin
ranges from light purple to black, with white hair and light eyes.
They are slightly swifter of body and mind than surface elves, but
also more frail. Most drows are considered attractive. Their personalities
tend to overshadow their physical looks, however.

The dark elves of Primal Darkness have just recently reappeared from
their banishment. Largely of one mind, they seek vengeance upon the elves
who banished them. Drow society is highly religious and hierarchial.
Most drows are concerned with personal power, whether martial, magical,
or political, and they will not hesitate to do whatever it takes to
achieve their goals.
