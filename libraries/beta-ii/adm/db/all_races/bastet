help physical
Bastets are a cast of proud, elegant man-cat hybrids. Their fur
ranges from deep black to shades of brown, red, white, grey and gold.
Often they will have longer hair in some parts of their bodies than
in others, usually around the head and tail, resulting in a sleek
or ferocious, lion-like appearance.
