Gnomes, characterized by their large ears and pointy noses, are short
averaging 1.5 meters and of medium to slight build. Their skin ranges
from grey to green and even violet and most grow thick white beards
which they proudly display. They are extremely wise but suffer
from frail bones.

help racial
The gnomes of Primal Darkness are a very scholarly race that
thrive on the aquisition of knowledge. They often pursue magical interests
or set into a life of invention where they are among the greatest
minds known. Gnomes are in general a peaceful people but not uncommon
are the ones who found the temptation of dark magic too strong to resist.
