Orcs are related to ogres and are nearly the same size but tend to be of
slighter build and show more intelligence. Orcs are usually green to
yellow in skin tone and are often quite hairy. Orcs have dark sunken
eyes and coarse hair and always smell. Orcs are swifter than their
larger cousins.

help racial
The orcs of Primal Darkness are among the most savage and warlike
people known. They thrive on aggression and have even gone so far
as to attacking their own cousins the ogres. Orcs are rarely loyal to
anything but their own personal glory. As with any race, this is not
always the case.
