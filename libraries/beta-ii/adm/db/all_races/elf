Elves are slender humanoids with pointed ears and slightly elongated
features. Skin tones vary greatly, from pale white to black as well as
blue and green and their eyes tend to be as diverse as well. Their exotic
looks are found quite attractive by most races. Elves are nimble and
usually very intelligent.

The elves of Primal Darkness are nearly as diverse as humans. They tend
to pick up any number of professions and excel in those that require higher
thought or good coordination. Elves are usually respected by most other
people despite their often arrogant disposition.
