The illithid of Primal Darkness are for the most part, highly intelligent
murderers who prey upon the brains of their victims. The challenge of
defeating a specimen with higher intelligence makes the feast that
much more worthwhile, therefore, the illithid tend to attack sentient
beings. Not all illithid behave in this manner yet their reputation tends
to suggest otherwise.
