Half-elves are just what their name implies. They are the
offspring of both an elf and human and hence have received both
the penalties and advantages of each race. They appear as
fully human except for they tend to be slightly smaller in build
and many have pointed ears. Most half-elves are attractive.

help racial
The half-elves of Primal Darkness are a race without a custom
of their own. They are usually well liked and find homes within
human cities, forests or rarely an elven populace. While they
usually relate well to humans, elves tend to look at half-elves
in the same manner one might view a 'mutt'.
