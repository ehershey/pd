help physical
Humans are a well balanced race both mentally and physically.
They stand near 2 meters and have a wide variety of hair colors, skin tones,
and variations in eyes.
Humans should never be underestimated as they have few penalties that prohibit
their development.

help racial
The humans of Primal Darkness are a war hungry race that always strives
to better itself and expand.
They are never satisfied and that insatiable thirst has driven them to
progress faster than any previous race.
Many ancient peoples such as elves and dwarves cautiously watch these
creatures, as humans can be very unpredictable.
