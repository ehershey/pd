Trolls are large, monstrous creatures often mistaken for orcs. All trolls
have enormous, bulbous noses and are covered in warts. Their skin can range
from black to brown to green to white, and what little hair they have on
their heads is usually black. Trolls are among the least intelligent
of the races, but their incredible ability to heal from almost any wound
makes up for this.

Trolls usually live in caves in small family groups. They hunt and eat
anything they can catch, including other trolls. Often, each group will
decorate itself with small bone piercings from their most impressive
kill. Trolls have no real sense of the world at large and exist primarily
to eat.
