help physical
Vampires have the build of a tall, attractive human, only with pale
white skin. Their hair and eye colors are the same as a human, except
some vampires have red, yellow or orange eyes. Vampires stand a little
over 2 meters and have generally muscular and fit bodies.

help racial
The average Vampire is much quicker than a human and its strength is
rivaled only by some of the super-strong races. Vampires are not
necessarily evil beings, simply dead, or rather, undead. Vampires have
no wings but have a natural ability to fly.
It is rumored that a Vampire's ability, power, and attacks come from his or her age.
