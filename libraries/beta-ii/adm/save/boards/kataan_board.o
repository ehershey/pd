I use the carrier and the assassin summon for fun alot. But i would like to see some more power summons because lvl 20 is the last summon we get. Which is the assassin, it used to have backstab, im not sure why it was removed. But since we can only summon 1 now could it be given back? I wouldn't mind seeing a lvl 30 summon 'pit lord' or something of that nature. A fighter demon with slash and whirl? Something that can assist us in xping and pk ofcourse ;). Ill keep ya posted.Luc.",]),(["size":1605,"date":1085547630,"title":"Kataan's","owner":"thoth","message":"Ok, here is my post about our subclass; the Kataan, done for Stormbringer :)I dont have to many complaints about our sub, so it shouldnt be to long.Summons: Kataans need a few more summon's, a new one every 50/100 summoning would be good, because atm our summons arnt that good, compared to say a necro's. Our assassin used to be able to backstab, i think we should get this back. I know it was removed because of abuse, but now that you cant summon more then one at a time i dont see how it could be abused.There should be a post somewhere on this board, with a list of some summons that could be added.As far as our spells go i think we are doing well. Change vortex to not hit party members and up the dmg or reduce the cost and it would be great. Atm hellfire does about the same dmg, costs less Mp and doesnt hit party members, plus we get it at level 20 and not level 50 like vortex.We used to have Disease, but it got removed because of Rubicante's abuse, then it got readded with less damage, then the mud went down, then we lost it when the mud came back up, this might of been because Hermes didnt want PD to have it, i dont know, but i think we should get it back.Dakzhul is a nice ability, would it be possible to change it so we can do something the round it hits? Like with charge, instead of us being unable to do anything? I think the delay before it hits is enough, no need for one when it hits.One last thing, can we get the price of 'fear' reduced, sometimes it costs up to 500mp :|Thats all i can think of atm for Kataans. Summons, Vortex, Dakzhul, Disease, Fear.Thanks :)",]),(["size":1630,"date":1093001566,"title":"my ideas","owner":"gob","message":"Well now that ive been this class for a bit(and have a lvl 25 with crap stats floating around I'll add my 2 cents.First for spells. Shadowburst is a decent enough spell but I think  it should be taken out and demonbolt should just be upgraded (i think its weaker) Cause i remember an old necro of mine having it demonbolt just fits us better.Now corrupt seems interesting but ive yet to figure it out. Anyone give me any pointers there?Area spells: We get hellfire pretty early so I dont see the need for annhilate(sp?), which i never liked anyway. Now Hellfire seemed weak to me but that was on my crap stat elf kataan, im guessing it will be better as a demon. Now on to the physical part.Impale: I like the move and it helped early on since my physical stats were good after remort but it still seems a little weak. The selling point of the kataan was the balance of physical and magic meaning one could do a little of both or focus on one. Impale seems a little on the weak side for this and the only other pike move i know of is the dakzhul. Also we can only wield one pike, so I was thinking the dmg could be upped on impale or maybe as we get better it has a chance for a second hit like:Impale att...you thrust your pike again!!Or something similar. Or maybe we can just get a better pike attack since we get the nifty kataan warpike we should have some extra specials other than impale which fighter classes get. I'll probably post a few pike moves later but thats enough of my ideas for now. Still a great and fun class and I look forward to wreaking havoc!!! >:DGob - Lord of Shadows, King of the goblins.",]),(["size":765,"date":1093022646,"title":"More ideas","owner":"gob","message":"Here are some ides I thought of for pike bades Attacks.Soulstrike: Summoning the souls of the dead into out pike we strike out with a deadly blow. I figure this can be based off faith and projectile and come at about lvl 25 , we can wield the warpike about then.Empower:Using the power of the demons we make out weapon stronger. (Think kataan version of bless, but evil) About lvl 30-35 this can come. This can help with physical kataans as our weapon choice is limited.Furystrike: A multi-thrusting attack using the speed of a demon(or the speed of a stronger demon if you are one :P) An elite attack this couls work like a multi impale where we slam our opponent with 3-4 quick stabs and on rare occasion a devastating finisher.Thats all for now. :PGob.",]),(["size":1873,"date":1093055137,"title":"Re: gob, ideas etc","owner":"set","message":"Well the furystrike idea is good but name would need tweakingand i dont think kataan should purely be a fighter class weare a more magical class thats true, and yeah a few upgradesto our physical attacks would be good.My proposal is that we get a bit more Magic Defense and a new spell at around level 60-70, A defense spellName: DarkauraDescription: A high level defensive spell in which demonicenergies surround the Kataan and provide it with a shield(similar to the delayed casting of staticshield) but thisshield is different because it not only can absorb blows itcan dish out a bit of damage too :)e.gGob stings you in the torso with his warpikeDark powers tear at Gobs soul!It would only absorb damage from idle rounds, and onlyreturn damage from idle rounds aswell, I just think a shieldwhich actually HARMS your opponent aswell as offering protection from your enemy would be cool, And judgingon the high gain level of the spell it shouldnt be toooverpowerful, But not underpowerful for a spell gainedat that level.

First it goes off like charge but the para at the end of it is useless. Anyone can charge/slash etc I don't see why we can't Dakzhul-gore/impale/shadowburst. Its not ;like its uber stack dmg. Now the gamage for my Dakzhul is decent but the only thing I know that effects it is murder, sides strength im guessing. Murder is hella expsensive, to mee it really needs to be a little cheaper and affect Dakzhul and the other pike moves we need.Impale: Now impale just plan sucks. Does like 50 dmg if that. But iy ya look at it. Not many classes use Projectile class weapons and we even have a sub-class specific weapon so it just seems common sense that we, the kataans, would have special pike abilities to show our training in the discipline principle. And that way impale can stay the newbie pike move it is but we can take it further. Now these moves can be affected by stats and murder, since I think murder uis a good skill to apply to us, being super demon worshippers and all.Thats all for now but I shall annoy you all with more ideas/thoughts latergob the novice Demon Worshiper.",]),(["size":1335,"date":1094474357,"title":"some ideas","owner":"gob","message":"Hmm...Well first out summons. I was toying around with them. While its fun to kill chance with a imp they arent effective in battle considering all the commands needed to use them.Also they dont get very strong and you get to assassin farely early.I understand why assassin demons cant be made too strong, would be uber easy pk if they got buff. But I was thinking. Why not a summon above them, a more fightery type we can use in with or for combat. A summon that canm go strong  but we cant use the assassinate with. Seems reasonable to me since we have the summoning why not make it more practical.So heres my idea and it seems pretty obvious. lvl 30ish we get a Hellhound.Now a hellhound is a cool and well known demon and having one fighting along side me would be cool. It could have a fire-breath attack and maybe a claw type move.Now for the higher level. While I dont know enough demon mythology to name sometime exact  at elite a kataan would be storng in the darkforces and able to handle a higher level demon. I'm sure me and the opther kataans could all agree on something we like. Maybe even a succubus(they are soooo sexy)Again it just seems fair to me and they dont have to be raknid zerker uber but decent enough that we could use one as a buffer for a really high mob.Gob Lord of Shadows, King of Goblins",]),(["size":691,"date":1108663467,"title":"spell idea","owner":"indalecio","message":"spell name: Demon gateIt's an area spell, it opens up a gate to the abyss in the room, several demonic arms reach out from the gate grabbing at your current opponent(s) it's sort of like a final attack, so if you got a monster(s) on dying and you open up a demon gate they try to get pulled in and if they do get pulled into the gate, they die a horrible death being eaten by the demons on the other side, who reward you with extra mp.100% success in summoningI'm just ideaing that you get a 100% chance of summoning a monster if there is a corpse in a room of a thing you killed, it's like an offering, there could be some different summoning description where it consumes the corpse.",]),(["size":909,"date":1134271867,"title":"suggestion: dakzhul","owner":"nulvect","message":"Uses approximately 150 sp and 140 mp.I can instakill 26k mobs.Maxed faith, nearly maxed projectile, ~ 150 attack, over level 50.My ranger is level 31, with less str and dex than I,with maxed or near-maxed attack, riding, and blade.His charge uses 80-90 sp and instakills 26k mobs.Also, you may use another ability (like slash) immediatelyafter charge hits, but not immediately after dakzhul hits.Dakzhul does hit 1 round faster than a non-centaur charge.I suggest dakzhul take 100-120 sp, 90-100 mp, that it allowus to use an ability right after it hits, and that mine shouldbe able to instakill approximately level 30-33 mobs.My str/dex are not very good for my level, but they areboth 10-12 higher than those of my ranger.
