So any physical attack can be attained by any physical class, they just have to get the skills to do it.So what will this do, it will give the number of abilities each player has a boost. Abilities, such as backstab, would have their skill bases be heavy in the skills that non-rogues either don't have, or are very low, like murder.This will give players more abilities to play with.","title":"abilities idea","size":489,"date":1141743590,"owner":"daboura",]),(["message":"Cures just for party members, so a stronger cure.A cure for everyone on the mud, make it a legend spell that being hp,sp, and mp to 1.Area boost for group members.Area cure for party members.","title":"cleric idea","size":197,"date":1141758260,"owner":"daboura",]),(["message":"Every subclass should get a subclass specific legend spell.","title":"legend ability/spell","size":60,"date":1141942740,"owner":"daboura",]),(["message":"Warcharge - legend level charge, extremly powerful.","title":"warrior/legend","size":52,"date":1141942942,"owner":"daboura",]),(["message":"Kataan shouldn get a VERY high level rez, it could rezz people into liches.

So inside the attack, slash for example, at higher levels, I would message a single slash, and as the skill of the user increased, it would message about getting in another hit, but instead of actually calculating another hit, I ould just change the modifier of the attack, ie 1.2, instead of 1.1. This would give the illusion of more attacks, when it is really just one attack having it's damaged upped. This sort of thing should be in most of the fighter abilities, like slash, maul, and all that stuff.","title":"fighters","size":685,"date":1143475326,"owner":"daboura",]),})
