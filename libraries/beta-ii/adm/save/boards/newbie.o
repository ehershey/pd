It just depends on what direction we want to take with the Mud. GodWars type, or RPG type.GodWars, this is really where PD has been floating around, since when I first started playing it was mainly a hacknslash with fear of running into some high powered mofo while on xp runs. This can attract alot of people, but as I've seen, it doesn't attract a main \"following\" if you will. The hardcores one that stay, in my case as well, were for friends you made on here to talk to in the normal setting while having fun.RPG game, this is where I started all my online gaming. Back in back in the mid 90's with the first version of AOL. But I was getting pissed about how people would cheat and \"mode\" is what we called it. Then one day my cousin came over, and said \"hey! I found these new games, they're called MUDs\" so ofcourse, I was said what everyone I've ever told about a mud has said \"what the fuck is a MUD?\" And when he showed me my first, I was hooked. To me, it was like having power over a character in a book. The freedom to design your own play however you wanted to interact in that world, and yet having structure behind it. Though slowly, losing focus on it from it's lack of endless possibilites. Once you reached lvl 50, you were done, completely. Get your gear, reach lvl 50.. and RP. Then I found that the IMMs (or they called themselves Gods in that one) took active roles in the RP. Which didn't mean putting some meaningful RP down, it just meant destroying people who got in thier high priest's(friend's) way. The mud soon fell apart when they had little people playing.It was then a friend form AOL told me about PD, during phase I. So it seemed, and I was hooked yet again. Friendly people, not really any RP, but what I love is the absolute endless possibilities. Does it ever feel like you're done even when you reach your first set goal? lol, I know I never do.So I think since, we have one of the biggest worlds Ive seen in a mud, with having a good looking map. An ocean and boat system, we should head towards an RP era. It would attract alot of hardcore gamers, but just my opinion!Hopefully you read this long post, if not, oh well.. I don't pst often, but when I do. Know it's something I have many thoughts on. But like I said, I don't mind the new change much at all, I have trust in you IMMs and coders as I always have. You haven't steered me wrong yet!",]),(["size":1357,"date":1261545070,"title":"mob power","owner":"stormbringer","message":"The mob changes have made mobs tougher but has also changed up how experience is awarded. I do think we might end up tweaking things once or twice depending on feedback, just know what was done was to improve the mud not make it tougher to play. We have many plans for the mud and RPG, partying, group battles etc are all part of it. We want to move the mud forward and we hope our plans and changes we are working on will help to do that. I believe MUDding will always be around and we want to make sure PD is part of that future in a good way, not as a stagnant remind of times gone by.If everyone will post on your class hall your thoughts on the mob changes, including some examples, numbers, etc we will collect all the data and tweak it where it is needed. We want to make the mud better for you, the players. We do not want to drive you away by making changes that make it unplayable for you or make you change your style of play drastically. I just hope everyone will stick it out and help us to make it better for everyone.I too was a group player Cyan, when I started mudding it was on a mud that you needed to party up to get the optimum exp per hour...

Only one area that I feel still could use some tweaking:Purgatory.I know it used to be a death trap and it was changed to try and make it less of a death trap. But it's a super mega death trap now. 7 level 80ish monsters in a room that swarm. Shadowed level 80ish monsters that swarm. Level 80ish (or maybe more) that always agro and you can't leave because you're in a maze and you'll just hit another. Scary stuff. If stuff didn't swarm or auto-agro it would be fine (although super hard still because they are just so big).The exp for purgatory is about half the rate I exp at in areas like drow, the new city, and the higher level parts of inferi. The monsters both take much much longer to kill and a single round of damage requires 4 rounds of healing up afterwards. If purgatory had a fair bit higher exp it would be worth the risk (and it's a huge risk.

More exp cuts than you would in an area like hell. 75 seems to be about the sweet spot for the lower level monsters in the area.2) Graveyard rocks. Love it. Perfect blend of difficulty and reward.3) The maze will definetly be for the big dogs (bigger than I am now). Fair bit harder than the city/graveyard. It looks good for people who get super big or want a bit more challenge.5) Mobs shouldn't swarm. Particularly shadowed mobs. There is a room with 7 monsters that swarm now and that will be insta death for anyone without at least 2k hp. Same with shadowed swarming monsters. That will be insta-death for a lot of people and those rooms won't be effective for anyone to exp in at any size. 2 or more lvl 90+ monsters attacking is just too much damage to fight without huge downtime for healing.Other than that it looks great.

Everyone else, hopefully next time I see you online I'll be able to get your rings to you.I apologize to those of you who aren't happy with how the event turned out, or the decisions that I made during the event.  I totally understand it, too.  On Merentha earlier this year, there was an event where dragons were given out.  I participated in it, and worked hard and thought I deserved one.  I wasn't given one because of who I was, even though I had won one.  I was pissed, as were other players who worked hard to get one and were denied them for similar reasons.  I made the decision to make the event a tie.  Stormy didn't want to at first, and I fought for it.  The final battle was supposed to be longer, and her torso was severed which I didn't anticipate.  It was supposed to last about an hour to two hours, while the next stage of the event was going to be implemented, with herbs being much more spread out and rarer.  The dragon was just going to fly down to the damaged egg, to let people know what to do.  I had to make last minute decisions, which may not have been the best ones.  However, it really bothers me that people are so mad and complaining about the decisions that I made.  I know everyone wants to win the top prize, I get it, but at the same time, I spent a lot of time making two areas, Stormbringer spent a lot of time making the new path, Nulvect made with a whole new system that was implemented (the alchemy to make the potion) that will be used more in the game in the future.  A lot of work goes into making areas, and making events.None of us get paid to work here.  Stormbringer pays a monthly server bill, I've donated to the server before, and players have donated too which helps.  I am a full time student studying for a degree, and I have a part time job working just to pay my rent.  I don't even have the money for January's rent right now, I have 4.75 in my bank account, and I don't know what to do.I could turn my part time job into a full time job, but I spend time on here building areas and making new things, trying to make the game more fun for players.  I was a player here just a year and a half ago, until I started building areas.  I *DO* enjoy building here, and being an immortal, it is fun.  However, playing a game, in my mind, is more fun than creating one.  It is sort of a given, but I choose to create the world you play in, to make it more fun for you.Having such negative thoughts and atmosphere after an event really hurts my ability to do this.  It makes me wonder why bothering.  Whether a player simply didn't know what to do, or was unhappy that someone else got a reward while they didn't get the same one, it makes it hard to have the motivation to keep going.I'm not crying for praise, or looking for groveling.  I do this in my free time because it does interest me, I am not doing it to be thanked or rewarded.  However, it is hard to do it when all that goes on is negativity and ingratitude.  All I am asking is that you try to look from a different perspective.  Instead of complaining that you don't think certain people should get a reward, or the event wasn't right for you, think of it this way:  There are three new areas in the game, two for low levels and one for high levels.  There are three new weapons in the high level area, an axe, a flail, and a melee weapon, which players have been asking for, and it was given to them.  If players continue to strive on the negative aspects of things instead of the positive aspects, I truly am not sure if I will have the motivation to continue to build onto this world.  Just because you don't think what you say will make its way to other people doesn't mean thats true.  I know you may be upset, but I ask that you please try to just look at the positive.-V",]),(["size":404,"date":1291836310,"title":"RE:x","owner":"enska","message":"first:Thanks to Vian, Stormbringer and Nulvect for making event here. and the timing was perfect.

Then Mrs. Claus told Santa her Mother was coming to visit, which stressed Santa even more.When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where. Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered.Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom.Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said very cheerfully, 'Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you.

This includes quitting, logging onwith an alt to do something for someone, then quitting that alt and logging backin with the char you were playing before. You received the tell/whatever on Char A,not Char B or C, so Chars B and C do not know about it.This includes party requests - if your friend is 20 levels higher and wants to partywith your alt, you can't just quit and log in that other character. You must waitat least 2 minutes between quitting one char and logging in another to help out,party with, or basically do anything to, someone else.Note that this time limit is not in the rules just yet, but it appears to benecessary because nobody can manage to keep characters separate.Also please note that you cannot leave chars link dead and log others on.There will be very little tolerance on this.

In order to promote a little bit of growth  over the winter instead of the usual decline that we see, I'm going to  be holding an area contest.  This is a recruitment contest, in reality,  but the prizes are area based.  If you recruit a certain number of new  players who are fairly active and stay around, there will be a number of  prizes given for the next area I start.        PRIZES:     - The first [10] people to recruit [1] player will get           -A monster with an (appropriate) name of your choice.     - The first [5] people to recruit [2] players will get           -The ability to design a (balanced) weapon or piece            of armour that will be in the area.     - The first [2] people to recruit [3] players will get           -Early beta access to the area.  After it is ~80%            complete, you will get an undroppable/auctionable/            etc key that will bring you to the area.  There are            conditions with this one, you'll know if you get it.     - The first person to recruit [4] players will get           -To pick an (appropriate) name for the area.     - The first person to recruit [5] players will get           -To pick the theme of the area (general design: the            type of area, weather, where it is, the kind of mobs            there, etc.)     If anyone has any questions on this contest, feel free to mudmail me!  -Vian",]),(["size":186,"date":1328350264,"title":"Updates","owner":"orcha","message":"Just want to say that the work being done on updates has beenfantastic.Big thank you to Nulvect and anyone else who has been helping!I know that I forone really apprecate the work.",]),(["size":145,"title":"Chronos","date":1331475077,"owner":"mortis","message":"Time passes...I login.My heart melts...Tears falls.Silly I am.How confuse can be the human feelings?How complex can be the creator nature?",]),(["size":108,"title":"XP Bonus","date":1335973753,"owner":"stormbringer","message":"There is a 150% xp bonus in effect until reboot, which should be sometime Thursday near midnight.Enjoy!!q",]),(["size":233,"title":"death update","date":1336892516,"owner":"nulvect","message":"The update to the death system is finally in place, read updatenews fora little more detail.
