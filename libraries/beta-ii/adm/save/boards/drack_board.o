You wake up in bed \"You are sleeping, etc, etc.\"  Then you go downstairs.  Your mother/father cooks you food, which you like eat or something.Then the good stuff starts.  A magic gate begins to open in your house, causing things to fly everywhere and the house to generally be torn apart.  Your parent tells you to go upstairs and get the family's sword from the main bedroom, where you'd have to like, search for a key and get it out of a chest or something.When you get back down stairs, there's a robed mage and a bunch of undeads in your house, asking your parent for where some object is.  Your parent refuses to tell them, which prompts a near instant slaying from the mage.Filled with rage, you try to kill the mage (kataan?) but he just fears you, leaving you crippled in fear and unable to attack.  Just as he's about to kill you, the village priest comes in an turns the undeads, and starts like, casting some spell which prompts the mage to leave back through his gate, which remains open.The priest cures your wounds but is unable to help your parent, who got owned by the mage.  You then get a chance to express your rage (or not?) at your parent's murder.  The priest tells you that as you are, there is no way you would be able to take on the mage who killed your family, and that you'll need to train yourself if you want to find out what he stole from your parents, why he wanted it, and to get revenge.The priest then says he'll either take you under his wing and begin to train you or he'll take you to one of the village masters who can teach you the ways of a particular class.  He'll then hand you off to a fighter, mage, etc, to do some training.At that point, you'll have the chance to be taught the basics of combat and training/advancing by the particularly dude you're training under.  He'll have you fight some things, and then he'll have you run an errand for him as a little mini quest.Doing all this will get you to like, level 5.At which point the priest will come back and tell you that he determined that the rift that was opened in your house leads to Arlon, and that he has a friend in Arlon who can help you get started in the right direction.  Convinced that there's nothing left to do in your village and ready for revenge, you hop the portal and get dropped off in Arlon, with a map that tells you how to get to the priest's friend.The priest then can show you around Arlon, and point you in the right direction for solving the first part of your lifelong quest.","size":2718,"title":"Newbie Quest","date":1271943986,"owner":"drackmire",]),})
