You walk into a room and with your blunt weapon, smash them on the kneecap. By doing this they would be able to fight back BUT they wouldn't be able to leave the room for a certain amount of rounds, all depending on your skills vs theirs.Maul - Thugs are mean bastards and maul is a mean move, so I don't see why we shouldn't get it too.Melee:Knee - Effect Move, DMG=Low-Med, Cost=Average. You knee your enemy in the stomach lowering their defense and agility for a few rounds.

Also, once my clobber knocks someone down, I can'tclobber them anymore til they get up, but somehow I can jab themor even smash them. The action of jabbing and clobbering of coursevaries some but more or less, they're cousins, I would think. Ifthe no-clobber on the ground thing could be reconsidered, that would be great. :)Now, there is the smash command. I love it, in theory. But, I havenoticed there are very few smashable surfaces around. In castlesin Tenebrae with walls in the room description, there are no surfaces to smash mobs into. In places with dead ends, only oneexit, there are no surfaces to smash mobs into. Heck, somethingkeeps me from going south, but it's not smashworthy. If the powersthat be could look into that, it would be very much appreciated.Once my clobber knocks folks down, it feels like I either throw a weapon at my foes or jab them with a level 1 command.    Aside from all that, I still find thugs to be very fun and have made this my primary character.
