I've heard more than a few comments about kataan vortex and raknid quad attack.  I've seen changes to druids which look pretty cool.  I've heard good things about wizards.  I've even watched changes to my dragon as those changes from other classes go into effect, from adding and then removing choke, adding jab, raising and lowering claw.  And I'm sure there will be more changes before it is all done.  I'd like to think that when everything is finished, dragons will be better as a whole.  I believe that while white and blue dragons have some really neat things, they seem to have been underbalanced as a whole, that red dragons were even more underbalanced, and knowing that only 1 spell separated black dragons from being considered quite underbalanced as well.  I also realize that what I consider a balanced class might be considered overpowered for the purpose of this realignment and the baseline may be lower than a lot of people may want, for more than just dragons.  So I will wait and see, and reserve judgement, and hope that stats like strength and intelligence will continue to be a major factor in the effectiveness of a character and a way to improve within the system.",]),(["size":525,"title":"...","date":1148793710,"owner":"smokey","message":"+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+( Primal Darkness )=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=[Player] Elder Orcha is Forsaken.

changes\"=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=so just gonna throw some things up therei think if we are gonna get some changes skill costs should still be uberexpensive simply cuz if tehres ever a new dragon they should suffer the pain wewent through to get our shit maxed cant even imagine what its like at level 70+i think we should get a bigger con bonus far better than fighters somethinglike more hp percentage bonuses as far as our physical abilities-i think claw needs to be more damage for more str and levels and skillswhateverbcto make claw a viable single round ability compared to using your classspecific magic single target attackswoop hits hard didnt realize flying was such a big part of it no wonder i misslowest flying of all so i dont use it but it was cool how before you could clawswoop clawu can swoop dragon fury dragonfury and land 2nd 3rd and 4th round could evenroar first if u wanted why not be able to claw swoop claw can even roar swooproar swoop roar swoop roar swoop continuous loop til your targets dead tootakes forever tho cuz its 2 rounds :P reminds me of my old breath infinite parasteal ur sp and mp which white dragons seems to do now without the para that ismy para needs work but thats for the blue board and im sure each dragon hasclass specific changes that should  have some player influence on your colorspecific dragon boards post your insights there leave these upcoming postsmainly focused on dragons in generalwith that said..dragonfury dragonfury takes 4 rounds no matter how ya look at it. it shouldnganal rape you one round after blowing 4 rounds. it currently leaves you stuck for 5th round cant do nothin kinda sux especially when targets can leave the room and dodge the attack.they dodge the dragon furies cuz they take so long to hitso i think roar is broken as it currently paras for 2 rounds allowing 1 attack (swoop)  in between roars.and a insta rage roar should be impelemented into dragonfuryinstead so that dragonfury paras the target until they both hit. notnecessarily para them fuckmode entirely maybe just immobilized shocked in fearmomentarily so they can't leave the room for four rounds.since dragonfury relies on pretty much EVERYTHING it should actually land ontargets. another thing to add would be cool is to have roar add random chance ofto disarm everything in the room dropping all weapons to the floor or inventoryor have it be a stat check verse off.and or roar somehow debuffs all targets my doing a sound barrier blast destroyingall enemy shields buffs and barriers n the like or in other words shattering them to pieces depnding on how buffs are worded.swoop should be a charge like ability and only done at beginning of combat. itshould be tail first similar to a knight on a horse with a polearm. cant beused in combat sp intensive also chance to disarm targetstbci meant to say that all that disarming targets were meant for roar not dragonfurywas tired and blazed so it came out wrong  ---------------------------------------------------------heres where i lost the rest of my post so im gonna summarize what it was about instead.hp: 2230|sp:i covered dragonfury, claw, roar and swoop in first half of post. second half post consisted of bite, tailspear, wrap, gustwind/wingflap, shield, what sucks is i lost the whole concept of constitution damage being linked into the elements of the dragons having a magical damage property on top of the melee damage that an ability already deals  this property would take chunks ouf your constitution......im going to go over that now and cover the other abnility ideas later.my theme post goes into it into a bit more detail but im missing 45% of the original post above which covered a lot of shit i dont remember how i phrased it so i hope this is clear. all physical dragon abilities have chances to force their target into prone status stacking magical constitution damage ontop the regular melee damage they already cause. this constitution damage stacks up and chomps out con resulting in the reduction of mad hp. . . tailspear renamed whiplash and two sub names cause it has two different effects both having the same outcome disarming causing to be prone or knocking enemies down for a round causing to be prone as well.has resulting in one or even two effects lashtail or tailwhip for example would trip and or disarm a target this  damage on bite and tail ability increased to scale with being weaker than claw because they have other sub effects bite being a super con chomper and the tail proneness. im not sure how it'd work exactly but basically if you do abilities in orders they stay prone and take constitution damage constantly stackingi think that was about the jist of it..im sure im missin some factors that i took in but thats about it i think.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------bite would now deal more danage and also take out a chunk of % of constitution and do melee damage. bite deals more damage if proned but also creates a bleeding mini con demi hp effect. tailspear upgrade to whiplash targets become prone  and take con damage and melee damagewrap = two things. first current wrap should scale better and last longer similar to a druid buff but half the time. other ide awas to forget the timer business and have it be like stealth on/off where you'd stay wrapped taking tail and stacking defense like it normally does. but in return you'd lose a lot of sp moving room to room while staying wrapped or have some downfall like that so you simply have to wrap off then fly somewhere otherwise u'd become super exausted flying while wrapped or just dont allow flying while wrapped. have wrap maybe not take a round like shield does. how you can throw a shield and wrap up at the end of a round after alreadying doing something else like a claw. that way u can wrap whenever but not travel far wrapped if your just slaugthering a certain area room to room stay wrapped but cant fly wrapped or just lose more sp per room. etc.gustwind or wingflap is a new ability for all dragons where they flap their wings forming a wind of gust blowing all enemies into a certain direction similar to an aoe bump effect. since all drasgons aoe this would be helfpul and gives an advantage over normal aoer classes.shield - i dont think all dragons get shield but most do or some form of MD buff. they should just last longer like druid buff maybe half the time so we can throw them up from time to time and give other players usable buffs----------------------------------------------------------------------------whatever im missing im sure theres somethin please post any feedback so we can get dragons done properly. i feel that by uniting all the physical draogn abilities that no one uses by creating a great damage scheme and utilizing all melee stats which in the end also helps your dragon fury top end ability. the whole point is that since we as dragons use all stats for some ability make you more diverse and ",]),(["size":2047,"title":"theme","date":1241246763,"owner":"smite","message":"i think my whole dragon con bleed/strike scenario is exactly what dragons need. a magsical neutral element that eats away at hp via eating your constitution for breakfast. all numbers would have to be fine tuned and i was thinking something along the lines of demi***or whatever that ability was in final fantasy 3 the demi whatever it was that took a % of your health based on the rank of the spell level so say you take a swoop, bite, claw. the first swoop would hit u into prone and inflicting constitution damage and melee damage on impact. so it takes an additional constitution stack cause its prone. your bite you unleash the next round target is now standing up from the swoop if it knocked it down into prone status. you lashtail tripping your target into prone, lashtail whipped for constitution and melee damage. target is now prone so it doubled up again. each stack would be a % of total stamina  or a % of raw hp. depending on how you wanna rolli think that covers itplz read and
