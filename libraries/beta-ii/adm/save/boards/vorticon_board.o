You are not allowed to take part in guild changes until you have reached a minimum of 6 players in your guild.	- Players refers to 6 different IP address, aka 6 seperate people, not characters	- Players MUST have a significant amount of playing time, not idle time; and players will NOT be counted as active if they sign on and immediately off just to get a recent date.	- It is suggested that you rid your guild of inactive 	members (those that have not been on for a month or so), but that is completely up to you; but as you're trying to create an active guild, there is no need to keep those that will not be on.  Those players will NOT be counted in activity.2. If you do NOT reach at least 6 fully active members by October 1st, your guild will be removed.**Your guild is being watched closely, if you feel a new owner is needed to better your guild (especially since the owner is the ONLY one that can make guild changes), you should contact the owner or show intent for the owner to be overthrown.  If the owner has not been on for at least 2 months, they can be removed as owner and a new one can step in.  If at any time you feel that it is not possible for your guild to obtain the required players, you may choose to close your guild.  Keep in mind that there is a very low player base and we have 6 guilds.If there are any questions, feel free to ask.Amun","title":"Vorticon","size":1465,"date":1218511044,"owner":"amun",]),(["message":"I'm looking for input on all members for guild changes.
