I've discovered a hole in time, and have taken over Arlon years and years ago, before the damned Gods of here took so much of my power.  Once I close the hole and have you trapped, I'll have years to harvest your power before they can do anything about it!  echoall %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Riu shouts:%^RESET%^ You must get to Arlon quickly!  We need to defeat Lloth before she closes the hole in time... this won't just save Arlon, but all of Primal Darkness!  players will then find the new path that will take them to arlon, hopefully it will take them a little bit to find it.  PastArlon will be mostly the same as it will be in game, except there will be an east exit out of square, which will have the caged Riu.  This will be the actual player, who will be there to give hints incase the event moves too slowly.  There will also be an item in the room, a magical cage.On Riu, when all players find Arlon:say Lloth is currently working on closing the hole in time.. we don't have much!  I'm trapped in this cage, it seems to be made from some dark magic.  I saw her take parts of it off, and each time, it made the magic of it stronger.  I think, maybe, you need to find the missing pieces!  She wouldn't have left them in the past, I'm sure they're hidden around the present land of Primal Darkness!  Take a look at it, please!players will look at the cage, and see 5 missing chunks from the cage.say Please, go find the missing shards!  If I'm set free, maybe together, we can defeat Lloth...  While I'm in here though, she can harvest my power, and is even stronger than usual![TIME TO GO FIND ITEMS]  If players are having trouble, maybe after 20-30 minutes if not a single shard has been found, Riu will echo-shout that the cage has given him a bond with the Valsharess, and he saw a memory of her on a tropical jungle island.  This whole sequence should take between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours, depending on how fast the players go.  It could go MUCH FASTER, which is why the Illithyd and King of Elven Village shards are there.  Even if the white, yellow, and gold are found quickly, the red and black should take a while.After all the pieces are assembled, Riu will be released.say You have released me!  Thank you so much!  We need to find Lloth and defeat her, banish her once and for all!  Lets try to bait her out!echoall %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Riu shouts:%^RESET%^ Your plan is being foiled, Lloth, I have been freed!echoall %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Lloth's angry shriek can be heard throughout the lands.%^RESET%^echoall %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Lloth shouts: Stupid mortals!  There is no way you will foil my plans!echoall %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^A dark storm cloud appears over the docks Arlon, thunder echoing throughout the realms.%^RESET%^(riu)say Follow me, quickly!The players will then follow Riu to find Lloth(room by room, hopefully quickly everyone will follow).  However, she will be protected by some HP inflated (2500000 or so) mobs, who must be defeated one by one.  The first to step forward will be a Drow Sorceress, 750000 hp, doing higher damage but having less HP inflation.  The next mob will be a warrior tank type, having 2500000 hp, but not doing too much damage.  The last mob before Lloth will be a 1500000 hp mob, doing moderate damage.  The room will have a tracker(if possible) to see the damage everyone took, the damage everyone dealt, and if applicable, healing done.  After these 3 mobs are dead, the forcefield will vanish, and the players will go against Lloth, who will have 15000000 hp.  She will barely do any damage at all.  When she is taken to around 100,000 or so HP, the room will be peaced, and the mob Lloth will be replaced with the player Lloth.Lloth cackles.Lloth says: You mortals, so naive!
