The highest we get is 5.5 on defence.However looking at my skills, i think Faith has been bumped up from 3.5 to 5 a lvl? Thats cool if its the case :)Maybe we can get our MA bumped frmo 3.5 to say 4.5 or 5 also? Less skills = easier to train, yet less skills = less dmg Thats about it atm, thanks :)","owner":"rindak","date":1080230267,]),(["size":551,"title":"Breath","message":"Hello againIve been trying to get faithwing, so as though i can xp with another spell other then dispell. Anyway while ive been training my skills ive found that breath is very expensive. ie; 400k for a point at lvl 26. Most other classes skills dont cost that much to they are lvl 50 or even 60. Id hate to see a high level white trying to max breathe at say level 50 or so, the cost would be insane.So Nightshade i was hopeing you could take alook at it and see if it could be made cheaper?Thanks :) - Why do my posts look like im complaining..?","owner":"rindak","date":1080583762,]),(["size":119,"title":"Update","message":"Breath costs a shat load, 450k for just over 1 point, thats from 121-122.Can someone look into changing this?

UNLESS YOU ARE A HAXED BLUE DRAGONYOUR BREATH WILL SUCK ASSAllos... train youre uber costly breathe skill.Boomer > YOU!","owner":"boomer","date":1098705230,]),(["size":2526,"title":"...","message":"Ok, I know none of you ever log on, but if you happen to and check this board, here ya go..Breathe isn't really worth using until level 50. And yes, it's a pretty expensive skill and doesn't train itself well. Our breathe was bugged, it was supposed to make mobs/players sit, but it didn't. Nobody ever addressed the admins w/this problem, so I talked to Daboura about it and he fixed it. It is kind of haxed, though. It works well on players because they usually don't realize right away they have to type 'stand'.This is a different story on mobs. At 50 your breathe will hit all mobs and make them all sit (unless they're too strong) but before the round is over, they automatically stand.Breath            222 (55%) 229 = 1.3-1.5 mil a pointI wouldn't use breathe for rooms of 2 or less for the simple fact that with enough wisdom, you can faithwing or solarflare both mobs 1 at a time rather than at the same time w/breathe and breathe takes up some wicked sp.This brings me to my other points.. our spells.First, when using breathe, things can get kinda ugly, and this is where we're at an advantage over the other dragons. Peace is a wonderful spell and has saved my ass many times, but it does fail occassionally. You'll get faithwing after dispell and it's tons better. After FW, some time between 36-42 you'll get solarflare. This rocks more than FW but again only hits 1 mob at a time. Shield is okay for defense but I wouldn't rely solely on it. Wrap is a good ability, for each point of tail you have you get a point of defense, but on the downside, it's way lame because it doesn't last very long.Now, I know there's some people out there like Orcha and just level level level level level and don't raise stats/skills much, and that's anyone's choice to do, but if you do want to get some stats, I'll make a recommendation. I'd pump wis/con/char in early levels. At 50 you'll get dragonfury which apparently depends on your str/con/int/wis and a bunch of skills. It's worth it, Cortoth has about 500 stats on me and his DF does about 1500+.. definatly worth it.We're a good mix of physical/spiritual skills so we honestly rely on all our stats. Dex becomes way beneficial when you start using breathe on multiple mobs. Str is good w/breathe, DF and just regular melee attacks. Wis is what's gonna make your spells do the dmg.We really are a good class and I love this char and am sure other white's would too. If you have any questions or anything, mudmail me and I'll be happy to respond.Smokey","owner":"smokey","date":1116158684,]),(["size":100,"title":"...","message":"drowsroston cavernslots of inferi (don't know if it is or not)merkForbidden ForestCitrunqerr","owner":"smokey","date":1153445214,]),(["size":215,"title":"...","message":"Idea..A buff-type spell that improves all dragon skills and int/wis.

I dunno about other classes, but faith doesn't really seem to help me a whole hell of a lot. The int/wis would be alright I suppose, but wouldn't be much different from druid buffs. When Hep finds enough time to finish the quest, I'm sure we'll have a few more dragons running around eventually.

In this case, <windstorm east> would send all the mobs in the room that certain direction. It could be similar or different from bump, meaning the mobs re-enter the original room, I don't care. If no direction is specified, the spell/ability could potentially scatter the mobs into various other rooms.Weaknesses: It could take about the same amount of time to get off as dragonfury and it could initiate combat and essentially para the caster. In this case the caster would have a good round or 2 to get beat on my the mobs. Also, I could see this costing around 300 sp to use.Smoke 'em if you got 'em","owner":"smokey","date":1213045462,]),(["size":43,"title":"...","message":"Can white's possibly get Godspeed?smOKey","owner":"smokey","date":1213998603,]),(["size":1319,"title":"...","message":"Ok, another quick idea. Nul, you and I were talking the other day about where we see white dragons in the future. I totally understand not having a massive damage spell, I don't even want one. I'm totally content with my breathe being my only area attack.Here's what I'm thinking....Damage over time spell/ability - I'd like one. It doesn't have to be area attack although I'd prefer it. =PDefense spell - All I have is shield, wrap and roar. I've already posted my thoughts on roar. Wrap you need to be in combat for.. why I can't wrap my tail around myself before combat makes no sense to me. Shield is decent but seems to me it's a lower level spell. Maybe a new defense spell?Buffs - You (Nul) brought this up, not me. If I had a say in this, I'd like to see a skill buff rather than a stat buff, but I'm completely open.A trip ability - It could be where the dragon trips mobs w/his or her tail, stomps on the ground causing a tremor or anything of the sort.Mass-bump - Maybe \"flap east\" - You flap your wings towards the east and the force of the wind knocks everyone out of the room. I dunno..I think I've posted a few ideas lately that I shouldn't have to cover again. However, my elemental trait is poison, I'd like to see something including that aspect of my character.Thanks!smokey da dragon","owner":"smokey","date":1214262959,]),(["size":86,"title":"white breathe","message":"Breathe will no longer always make the target sit on a strong hit, it's a chance now.","owner":"nulvect","date":1223169854,]),(["size":299,"title":"...","message":"Ok, I'm not gonna piss and moan, but since the only ability I have worth using got revised, can I please get a new spell/ability/defense ability/buff... something?Yeah, white breathe was somewhat overpowered, and I haven't checked the rate yet, but I'll let ya know how it compares.Smokey ... =[","owner":"smokey","date":1223686522,]),(["size":255,"title":"re: ...","message":"The damage was not changed.
