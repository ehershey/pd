Using a blunt weapon(s) you spin them swiftly in your hand(s) for a dazzlng effect, and a devastating attack. Ever see a guy twirl a staff really fast, or smaller sticks? It looks real neat and the momentum built up in the spinning can be used for a nasty attack.  This could work off blunt(our best weapon skill) and dex maybe?Dregs twirls his weapons about in a flurry, striking his opponent! (or add your own attack line but ya gert the idea)Also as an alternative why dont we have mug? It fits kind with us and we have high blunt but get cut? wtf is that? Maybe give us mug for a temporary solution cause we need som,e kind of attack, flick is decent but is -soaking- up allll my bloody savings and if I have to keep using 9it i will go broke.  Seems only fair to me and how it should have been. Consider if rogues maul but still have the higher knife skill, doesnt make sense does it? Same thing with us we get all these blunt skills and no moves to show for it and instead we get a very watered down stab? the knife skill is too lower than blunt to really consider using it.Thats all for nowDregs the troublemaking Jester.",]),(["size":315,"title":"another idea.","date":1095025909,"owner":"dregs","message":"Flipkick - We are agile little devils, going flips and cartwheels for entertainment, why nmpot put that to attack use?

However cut has been downgraded a bit. So those of you using cut I suggest doing some money runs and using flick. I exp flicking gold and I do just fine. Also throw is much improved as well. Takes alot more sp and you need to carry weapons of course but it does a little more damage than flick. Also were about to get a new move it has two big points.1) It is going to be a big damage move. (well for us jesters anyway)2) Its going to cost us money :(I'm not going to give the details of it but I assure you its very cool.

I know that being drunk has a negative effect on normal combat, but using fb depletes your intoxication by 1 bar, so you could get sober rather quickly, or you can choose to stay tipsy to the max and have a killer fb.Just my idea of being more monetary savvy.Here's another idea for an ability.ability name: Spare ChangeIt's a area spell which only hits current attackers. You throw some spare change at your enemies to deal damage.Spare change is classified as the least expensive currency you're currently holding.And you throw 10 coins of your least expensive currency in order to do it, If you do not have 10 coins of you least expensive currency you can't do it.some examples.If you have copper, gold, platinum, your spare change would be 10 copper coins.If you have gold and platinum, your spare change would be gold.If you only have gold (ie only 1 form of currency) you cannot perform spare change cause you don't have any spare change, you must have at least 2 forms of currency.If you only have 8 copper coins, gold and platinum, You cannot perform spare change, cause you need at least 10 of your lowest form of currency.damage modifier could be based on the currency which is used as spare change, Gold would be the highest since there is nothing higher than platinum. It utilizes both bargaining and entertainment skill for damage.	 Coin Saint",]),(["size":870,"title":"oneliners","date":1109514125,"owner":"saint","message":"perhaps we should lose singing and have a oneliner ability instead, It makes you say a oneliner joke which could have certain effects when done in front of an audience. eg monsters are paralyzed by laughing to much, monster gets stomache pains from laughing to much.

Mystify seems to fail about 85% of the time on monsters that are much weaker on me, and the fail rate goes up as the monster gets stronger. We have very few unique abilites and most of our attacks are just added on from other classes to make it seem like we have more. sp costs are a big issuse i have found with jester, as flick is extremely sp costly, and flip gets pretty high in the elite area. in the arena i am easily overcome by anyone who has modereate hp and can deal damage quickly, my flick does decent damage to foes, but i am ususally either mowed down because of their higher damageing moves, or my lack of defenseive ability. perhaps maxing defense would change that, but personally i doubt it. in the pve aspect, we kill slower than most classes it has seemed to me. Having played almost every subclass to at least 30 i have always lagged behind in the exp department. At 37 it wasnt a damage issue, i was dealing fairly good damage for my level, but when i leveled to 50, i gained almost no power, and i deal nearly the same amount of damage as i did when i was 13 levels lower. Also currently there is no ability gained after level 20, so there is no real incentive to level past 20 in the aspect of new abils, and no incentive to level past 37 because the exp rate will be chopped down even further. and at elite, i apologize if i mentioned this once before, but after 6 flicks my sp is already nearly depleated, and i am forced to stop and regain sp to be able to kill again.And this is my overview of what its like to be an elite jester and how it felt to play through one. You may take this post however you please, if you think i'm complaining, then so be it. If you think im trying to present data for the administation to look at it, fine. I just felt this should be posted up so show everyone what its like.Endbringer. .",]),(["size":214,"title":"re whatever","date":1138628864,"owner":"saint","message":"supposed to get firebreath, ages ago asked about it when I was elite over a year ago, still hasn't been implemented, last i heard it was a coding error where the requirement was looking for the same criteria twice",]),(["size":788,"title":"Sp issues.","date":1153243226,"owner":"joker","message":"I really think that our abilities cost too much sp...Also, ive noticed that out abilities seem to be strong at a low level, but they dont improve much over stats and skills.
