In judging a player for breaking the rules, what do you want to know about their history of infractions on Primal Darkness?  Here is what I can think of immediately:DATE:One of the most important pieces of information.  We need to know when this report was filed.IDENTIFICATION:Here you list the character names most commonly associated with the player in question.  If you have a real name, it may be worth posting as well.  Their e-mail address, if you have reason to believe that it will be there for a while.  Last known IP address may be helpful information.  Subheadings in the IDENTIFICATION category could include: player name, character names, e-mail, last known ip, etc.CURRENT INFRACTION:Describe in detail the behaviour of the player in question which has lead to this punishment.  If a bug is involved, maybe put in red, %^RED%^%^BOLD%^Reccomend Investigation of Bug%^RESET%^.  If you have logs or other kinds of evidence, indicate them here.PAST INFRACTIONS:Make a synopsis of the player's criminal record to date.  This should be easy.  If the task is tedious, then you have evidence that enough 'second' chances have been allowed.PUNISHMENT:Indicate the punishment associated with the current infraction.  Don't forget important details like the amount of time that the punishment is effective for.  Here is your chance to go into more detail than you were able to in the one line justification that you get with 'arrest'.MISC.:Include whatever information you want that doesn't fall into standard categories.Can anyone think of info they would like included?  We could have items for a standard report and additional 'optional' items that can be added on where the reporter feels it necessary.LeviP.S., Arrest that man!  *points to Nightshade*",]),(["size":37,"date":1131058837,"title":"me?","owner":"nightshade","message":"Why arrest me?  you're the criminal.",]),(["size":117,"date":1131061439,"title":"Kumi","owner":"levi","message":"I made a really stupid error.
