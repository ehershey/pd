I got my str up to 80 and theres almost no dmg increase. A lvl 19 rogue with near base stats  can whuup me easily. Now considering I'm lvl 37 with a stat total over 350, that sends up some red flags. Also the number of hits needs to be looked too. At lvl 37 I can do a total of 5 hits with my BD but more often I do 2 or evern just the single hit. Can we have a maximum and minimum that goes up with our level? Like say I can do 5 at 37 but wont do less than three. Because with the dmg on it so lowo unless you do full BD hits it takes forever to kill anything. Trip/Disarm. Now I like trip on mobs, use it often. Disarm as well, it can be very handy. BNut in terms of PK they are absolutely useless. People can stand/re-wield in the same round and still get their idle hits -and- do a specialI ve said all this before and I'll say it again.

If you were to put the flash abil on the same type of trigger or timer as the backstab it would be more useful..IE <flash monster> You prepare to blind your enemy... (next round comes) You flash your etc etc; bladedanceyou should be able to bladedance the same round that you flash BUT you should have to wait a round for the flash to go off.. i think that would be MUCH betterplease.. i know you all read every post so please at least respond to tell me to go F myself instead of leaving me here hoping..please please upgrade swashbucklers! ",]),(["size":200,"title":"erm","date":1094292372,"owner":"matrim","message":"also i feel like kind of an a$$ just wanna say that i know a lot of hard work was put into the class and i'm sorry that i came off as complaining, I just wanted to get the idea's out there thoMatrim",]),(["size":246,"title":"stuff","date":1094302636,"owner":"stormbringer","message":"Just to let you know, stuff is being worked on for this subclass.
