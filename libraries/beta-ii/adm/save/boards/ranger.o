What differentiates a ranger from a normal fighter is their ability to be one with nature and use the bow and arrow with deadly effect.However, this is not so, in Primal Darkness. Hence why there are only 4 lvl 35+ rangers, and only 1 ranger that's active.I believe abilities such as trap,skin,make,gut,forage,build,brew are very useless and redundant. I'm sure many of you will agree with me. After all the key to this game is killing mobs for experience. In what way do these abilities help us? None. The only use for them is waste extra mud memory and for the newbie amusing effect.I have to say though, mudarmour is quite a good ranger ability, as I myself have often used it in my exp runs. Congrats to the coders for making up that idea. Having said that, imho, major changes are required for the ranger subclass, as other fighter classes get bonuses which help their exp runs, while rangers get all these useless things to fill up space.Paladins and Antipaladins, they get boost,cure and godspeed,demonstrength, this helps them expBerserkers, they get rage, one of the best exp abilities, this lets to exp with 20 sp.Warriors, they get 6 skill points a lvl, making them deal more dmg and take less dmg, wield better swords, which leads to better exp runs.Rangers, we are warriors with 5 skill points a lvl, with mudarmour as our only good special ability. Are rangers balanced compared to the other fighter subclasses? Certainly not. I've been doing some testing, and this is what I have found.Trap - Very useless object, it can be disarmed and avoided easily by someone much less skillful than the ranger. Even if it does deal dmg, it deals around 0-30. I know what the admins are constrained with. If they make trap too good, then rangers will abuse it to pk newbies. Therefore, i think trap should be scrapped. I am convinced that we don't need this ability.Build - Currently is bugged (can't even build fire or shelters now) - Also useless object, only made for amusement factor.Make - Seems like weapon and armour class of the stuff made are not related to the ranger's nature skills. Therefore a lvl 50 ranger will make the same crappy armour as a lvl 5. I think this can be improved by making the quality of the final product proportional to the ranger's nature skill.Brew - Similar to make, the effect should be proportional to the ranger skill. Hey, why should we drink the healing tea when we have oils and ointments?Tame - Tames little animals to follow you around, that's nice to see. However, when you do kill monster when exping, you attack your own tamed creatures. I believe after you tame them, they should be removed of id monster. Also, when they see you attack something, they should aid you in demolishing the enemy. This is similar to the concept of summons, except you can't command them to say stuff and assassinate people. And the exp they make will go to your exp instead, or they keep the exp and grow in level. I believe this will be a great exp special ability, and make rangers stand out as a unique and cool subclass of fighters. ",]),(["size":3453,"date":1085570990,"title":"Ranger Completion","owner":"eios","message":"I believe these abilites and skill changes will complete the Ranger subclass. (please excuse the grammar I tried :P)Skill changes:Remove the Murder skill -> We don't use it and it's just a waist having it there.Give us 6 Projectile Per level -> Rangers are hunters and basic hunter weapons are a bow and spear so it makes sense also projectile if i'm not incorrect is also in the code for the abililty shoot. The real big reason for this is that we're Rangers and using a bow and arrow is ment to be our big thing, but since Warriors get 6 on every weapon skill they have the best shoot in the game and it's to me just plain silly.Ability changes:Trap -> Right now it's completly useless because there are a few factors wether it hits or not, them being Dumb Luck and High Perception. When they do hit it's for like 7 damage. Also i've noted that the chance of them hitting is like 5%. Prehaps if there where difference kind of traps like Gas trap (poisons enemy), Cage Trap (keeps the enemy in the room, preventing them from running) and Damage Trap (can deal a decent amount of damage). To prevent the abuse of traps prehaps it could be made so that you can only make 1 untill you either 1. Dismantle it or 2. Someone runs into it.Make -> A good thing for RP and pure bordem. The clothes and items we make out of them are to be honest weak and dull. Spears have the lowest wc i've ever seen and the clothes we have are low in ac. Now these items we make don't autoload and I remember Nightshade saying once that it was because if they did everyone could get them and there would be no use for the skill. Currently there is no use for the skill since all the items suck. So if they could be upgraded and made useful we might be able to make the items and profit off them.Forage -> 2 things are messed up in this. It's bugged sometimes when you enter say: forage mud, nothing at all happens, you press it again and it says you're busy. That needs to be fixed. Also when you forage for herbs you cannot choose the type of herb you wish to forage for and it's completly random making it very annoying and time consuming to get the right herbs. Prehaps if you made it so you could forage herb <poison/healing/antidote>.Brew -> Only problem with this is that the healing teas we brew up heal like 20hp. Now a level 80+ Ranger with very high Nature healing for that much is just nonsense making it unused. All i'm asking for here is a healing tea upgrade, maybe Nature/2 == the heal amount.Shoot -> It does no damage...Abilities Needed:Camouflage -> Syntax: camouflage, Makes the Ranger invis. When camouflaged any movement will bring you out. Since we are fighters the chance of people being able to see us would depend on their Perception skill and Intelligence vs the Rangers Stealth and Nature.Ambush -> Syntax: ambush <oponent>, Once that is done the Ranger will sit in the room untill the oponent enters then he will strike at them with a powerful blow. If the Ranger is camouflaged while ambushing there could be a 5%-10% bonus since they're hidden and are able to strike them more effeciently.Fletch -> Syntax: fletch <poison/pain>, Gives us the ability to make arrows of poison or arrows that just do damage.Impale -> Currently warriors and Kataans only have this ability from what i'm aware of but I see that since Rangers can already create spears and are hunters this ability should be granted to them.  --Eios.",]),(["size":886,"date":1141206006,"title":"My take on ranger","owner":"sabado","message":"I was reluctant to play a fighter, but this is my first one here so far. And Imust say, I enjoy the ranger. Tame is very useful for testing command strength.I can tame a beastie, command it to report, give it my best shot, then have itreport again before it runs away. Now, I don't have to be like all these guyswho wanna stab ya up in the arena and ask you how much what command did.Skin, forage, gut and brew are handy but I think we could use a little tweakto them. If we could perhaps forage some ore, maybe we could incorporate itinto the armour we make, strengthening it? Also, something not that importantbut if we could forage berries or gut our corpses to get some differentpigments, it could make our temporary armour more interesting.Mudthrow and mudarmour are very handy, very nice. :)Anyway, thanks for making this subclass and keep up the good work! :)-Sabado",]),(["size":2701,"date":1143146547,"title":"ideas for rangers","owner":"carina","message":"My thoughts on rangersif there are things not mentioned in this, then it is things i dont see a need in changing or I have not ideas on it.

HOWEVER, i think rangers should be able to track cloaked figures, b/c rogues should be able to be detected SOMEHOWMake: Ok with make, it is cool how we can make things, but I think the better nature skill you have your stuff should go up in armour class, and not have it pretty much useless, most of the stuff is bugged and it all is bad with ac.forage: with forage, I think the more Nature skill you have, the more things you can forage at once, with sp cost of course.  so like lvl 20 could forage 2 mud balls at once, 30, 3 balls, 40 4 balls, 50 5 balls etc etc. again at say 20sp per ball or something to that nature.aim: never works, i use it and it never goes where i aim.As a ranger it would be nice to see some more deception abilitites.  We are the masters of the forest, we should get camoflauge (sp) which could be like cloak is for a rogue. Or some stealth move as we can be like a camelion if we wish and not been seen. etc etc...These of course are all just ideas and my thoughts.

I think that a person should be required to use a knife.  I would like to see the most skilled woodsman skin a corpse with a broadsword.Second the skinning process is instant.  The moment I begin I can leave the room.Third I never botch the skinning process.Now, a novice is not going to be particularly skilled at skinning corpse.  He is going to mess up the pelt from time to time.  He is also going to take a great deal longer to complete the process than a master would.

Said animal will follow the ranger through reboot, disconnect, until it either dies or is replaced.  Now  I would like to see them get a portion of the ranger's experience and grow themselves, so that they remain useful to the ranger.  They would retain all of their nature abilities(like should they have an ability of spell[though i doubt an animal short of a drake would have spells]) however the ranger can not command them to use them it would be random as it would have been when fighting the animal.  This would not work on a monster or a being, merely animals.Down sides:  the animal would have to be well fed or it would run away and after you've spent all that time training it lets face it that would be, extremely, annoying.
