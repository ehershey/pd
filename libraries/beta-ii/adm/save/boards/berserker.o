Rage before level 50 is dangerous... but it makes a GREAT xping tool for mob rooms you know you can mow. It works super well when partying with a room spell user of a healer.

Considering Zerkerz are all about melee, lets consider their ability to counter attacks with their bare hands allowing them to sneak in attacks, no not like riposte, I was thinking more of the lines of a taunt- making your opponent attack you disabling their charge or backstab or initial attacks and also giving the fighter a chance to combo the counter with his on attack.Another idea would be to have a zerker have pummel with the chance of a second pummel and at a higher lvl they could have backhand with a chance to do a pummel strike. Now for an initial attack, i suggest some sort of grappling attack where opponent might have a chance to get away or attacker could do something crazy like some wierd wrestling move or headlock them and pummel them in the back of the head...Last but not least, the finishing move...

I was wondering thou, seeing as cleaving is usually a multi target attack, if that could be implemented to Rage somehow...still keep everything as it is, dont increase the chance that cleave has to be chosen during Rage or up its damage, just make it hit more than one target, maybe even everything your in combat with.
