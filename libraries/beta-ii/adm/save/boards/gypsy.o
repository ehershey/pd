Now, I'm not sure what we have already, because I'm not exactly higher level, or that well off with my skills, but we should at least get a small attack spell, like fireball or whatnot. Maybe something for hp/sp also.If none of that gets a second look, that's alright, my biggest thing is that as I mentioned, Gypsies are known for being nomads, I think we should be able to set up encampments/tents in non-safe areas. The tents would be able to be attacked and destroyed so they wouldn't be used to escape a pk. While in the tent, you'd regenerate to full hp/sp/mp within a certain roundset, and possibly be able to use it to advance, since it would be a temporary home. The hall would still be necessary for skills and such. To use it, it could maybe take away from mp to create it, and/or take so much money to use for materials. It's a base idea, and I'm not sure how coding would be, but if it's possible, I think it'd be a good addition to the class, if not a unique one. ",]),(["size":608,"date":1095647052,"title":"My two cents worth...","owner":"zoisite","message":"Spells aren't for us.  We are gypsies.  We are foretune tellers, dancers, and thieves.  One thing gypsies are reknowned for are their curses.  I have compiled a few I would enjoy seeing.Curse with Ugliness- lowers charismaCurse with sickness-gradually lowers spCurse with Dance-evolved sp lowererCurse with the evil eye-Lowers all statsThese are but a few of my ideas.  The strength of these curses would be dependant on conjuring and int/wis of the caster.  Which brings me to my next point:Remove Curse-self explainatory.

I'm especially concerned with getting moreuseful things with clairvoyance since it's your unique skill;the curse ideas in earlier posts here may work for that.Please post up any and all ideas right on this board, and I'll read them over.",]),(["size":16,"date":1297372411,"title":"on board","owner":"ramona","message":"i like gypsies.",]),})
