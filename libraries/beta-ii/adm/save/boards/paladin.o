My smite failed on him when he was at 1400hp. Now, before I said anything he said he thought that was was nowhere near what it should do.Aldur is a demon, he is satanic. I am godly, I am arguably buffest player on the mud. We though my smite should be doing more like 1800, and *uber* to mobs.I noticed thigns became a bit more stats based, but still my smite has taken a bit of a downgrade, yet all my other abilities do more because of my high stats.Also, can bless be made so that it increases the weapons current WC by one point, until it reaches original_wc + (random(2)+1). That way we can bless swords that have deteriorated below their normal wc rating. Or perhaps it stops a weapon from degrading, but doesn't add a wc bonus?Mysticblade, can the specials be seriously buffed up? Lvl100 I still don't get a guaranteed glowing avenger, and the special on it is worse than dragon slayer. I was hoping to get something that does serious damage, especially to things with a low alignment. These weapons are unique to pally's, and a pally can only wield one at a time.Could mysticblade be made so that it is called 'mystic' and you can choose to get a blade or blunt?Can cripple be made so that it does damage right away, and we still get our idle hits in? I think the damage it does would be fairly on par.Could we get a <pray> ability where sit down and kneel, getting healed like (faith) each round? It'd make us paralyzed until we stopped.Can godspeed eventually affect str and dex, like once you reach a certain level, or get enough valor?Can smite do double damage to mobs so that you can use it to exp better on low level mobs?Tis all for now.",]),(["size":1093,"date":1080448333,"title":"Stuff that affects","owner":"aziraphale","message":"I'm thinking pally's need more spells that affect you somehow. Stuff that increases attack or defense or whatever.What I specifically had in mind were perhaps 2... maaaayyybbbeeee 3 spells, that had like 8/9 effects in total.That way you have to choose 2/3 of the effects you want, you can't have them all going.So say there were blessings, prayers and chants. Blessings could act as spells, taking 1 round to cast. Prayers take 3 rounds, and chants.... perhaps you would have to pick one and it runs while you are in combat, in a rage sort of way. Or perhaps the chant could take effect automatically when you are in combat, draining mp, and you just select which one you want to use.Blessings could be 'godspeed', 'godstrength', 'avatar'. - speed at 60faith, strength at 120faith, avatar at 240faith. Avatar combining both.Prayers could be... defiance(defense/magic defense), vengeance(attack/magic attack/faith)Chants... can't think of names but stuff that does like (melee/blade/axe/blunt/flail/etc), (str/dex/con), (attack/double wielding/valor) - You know, that old chestnut.",]),(["size":118,"date":1085576320,"title":"sense","owner":"aziraphale","message":"I know sense is a clergy spell, but can we get it too?

Even after they go below their original weapon class.Can bless be changed so that it only gives a bonus of 1 WC, but keeps the weapon from decaying?

Before the PDII came about, but not many probably remember or know of that. Anyhow, paladins used to be able to make armor along with thier sword. It was taken out for being too buff at a time when mages had unlimited gate spots, demon gore pwned every other physical move, and assassins?? yeah..But.. I suggest something better..Instead of being able to make armor again, since I don't even use my mysticblade anymore.. and you're going to make us more riding/charging class.
