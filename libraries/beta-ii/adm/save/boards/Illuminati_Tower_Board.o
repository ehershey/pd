Scamp I know of theFew that you may hunt ;) and that is cool with me...I already know about them. IF there are anymore names people wish to pk, ask a leader first.  IF youShould PK WITHOUT permission...you will be demoted on the first offence...afterThat...well lets not find out.Happy hunting!Please watch out for Bellos guys he is logged on at all times. He mainly goes after Angels over lvl 19 and He is ALWAYS cloaked that is just info I am sure would be nice to know.Guild items and updates\"Member bands\"The member's bands were not working for everyone but raknids after the change in the code.  Daos tried but could not get it to work to where BOTH raknids and everyone else could wear the bands.  So I figured there are more non raknids then there are raknids, so for the mean time the bands are switched back to normal.  But Daos will keep trying.  Until then, the bands are normal.I will be coming up with ideas for the guild I will be removing the short staffs with a different one and removing a guild weapon it's stupid and is worthless for this guild I will be bring back the seal to the guild hall and the glass spheres there will be a container you will be able to buy and a pack as well the armor mostly will stay the same I might take out the golden crest the only good thing about it was if you died I went with you but I think it's too expensive for being a guild item please post your thoughts and ideas it will help out remember this is also your guild as well.\"Website\"The Illuminati Website is up it is not 100% correct on the members page. Everyone feel free to check it out and leave a message on the message boardhttp://www.angelfire.com/rpg2/guild_illuminati/mainThere is the website for it.  There will also be changes to this sight when I have time have fun ya'llFor all membersOn right now, I would appreciate if from now on, you actively check the Illuminati Board and post when you so desire.  I am now no longer making decisions on my own about who joins this guild.  I would VERY much like to have the opinions of my fellow guild mates on who enters into this guild; your feedback, whether good or bad about a character, will be taken into account, and then the decision will be made.  I value all members' opinions and I value all your thoughts. Thank you.%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Fury %^RESET%^%^WHITE%^& %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^Golden  ","title":"Members","size":3207,"date":1155692005,"owner":"furiae",]),(["message":"licks","title":"meow","size":6,"date":1155865911,"owner":"goldenberry",]),(["message":"again you PKed without the permission...we here have rules, and if you cannot follow them...then maybe you should not be here","title":"scamp","size":128,"date":1156286196,"owner":"goldenberry",]),(["message":"%^BOLD%^%^RED%^IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE RULES OF THIS GUILD YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOW!
