You begin to concentrate, focusing your mind powers upon <thing>. 3 turns later. With a roar you release the energy built up inside of your mind at <thing>) Just an idea.I'll probably come up with some more ideas, I would also like to see a stronger, more offensive psiblade, but I don't know, again that's not my choice/decesion.",]),(["size":330,"date":1153723309,"title":"Psistorm idea!!","owner":"vayne","message":"K, if you type in help psistorm you read that it picks up objects in the room and throws them towards everyone/everything in the room (outside of party of course). Wouldn't it be cool and more realistic to be able to drop items and increase the damage of Psistorm.

Their unique skillis psionics, and few to none of their spells are psionic in nature.I've got a starting spell list right now that is modelled on D&D psionicists(not a straight rip off though). Sorcerors will have many spells thataffect the mind, but not with fine control. The way I think of itis psionics is to telepathy as a hammer is to a sewing needle -you can affect someone's mind, but it's like a brute force assaultrather than being able to selectively disable and mess with them.That said, I think people will like the way they're going, as theywill cause several negative effects with their mind attacks.Their skills will stay the same, or nearly the same, as they are now.Any ideas that fit this general layout can be posted on here andI will read them all.(For reference, mindshock, mindstab, and psistorm are the onlycurrent attack spells that will be staying)",]),(["size":371,"date":1262013050,"title":"enchant \"upgrade\"","owner":"enska","message":"It would be nice to make create 'armor' more useful. like. wizards and sorcerors get enchant, so it would be cool to enchant mage armours and weapons to unique state like:first: steel bracerssecond: Mithril bracersthird: Adamantium bracersFourth: Onyx bracersfifth: Crystal bracersmaybe different materials or something but you get the idea, eh? would be nice ^^",]),(["size":394,"date":1262013518,"title":"Wish","owner":"enska","message":"Who gets it?every mage!you could wish things like stats, skills, level, money, weapons, armour, rings.but. there would be penalty too. like, stat loss, death, money, skills, armours/rings/weapons.weapons, rings, armours would be unique. useful to any class so mages could sell them for high prices if they dont need them.Level when mages get it? like 75? maybe 90.something to aim for :)",]),(["size":455,"date":1271790484,"title":"Mindstab","owner":"mathiu","message":"I love the idea behind Mindstab, but it seems to be rather weak.

So fun.Secondly, would you be opposed to allowing another casting the same round the second psistorm it hits?

For one, it personalizes gate for sorcs instead of having just a generic gate spell.  I also like the fact that you would only be able to do objects at a low lvl and with skills you would be able to eventually teleport yourself,  I know we would be giving up the fact that we would be able to gate others, but our conjuring is one of the lowest out of the mages and it makes sense.Yun",]),(["size":200,"date":1277932088,"title":"gate","owner":"nulvect","message":"So we're going to try out scenario 1 from my earlier post.
