I think you need to do some more testing in that regard, as levin rangedfrom more than twice as effective as whirlwind to only incrementally better,depending on the situation.That said, I did make it more effective against more evil targets.Holyfire or something like it may come back, but not right now. This rebalancing wasto fix levin and gore, one of which was too strong and the other too weak.Now they seem to be fixed. Sorry you all got used to having an overpowered spell.",]),})
