Changing the very essence of things to their will, wizards command raw magics most would not dare to touch./wizards command raw magics most would not dare to touch./Where is this magic? as I look in my spells list all I see are spells from Druids or Pyromancers ... Yes we do have the defult mage spells like missile but hey where are those /raw magics/ spells?After looking for some spells on the internet at some sites here's a list of some and how they could work.-- Haste: Makes you attack twice as, use abilities twice as fast and use spells twice as fast. Duration of the spell could depend of Wizardry, Conjuring and Intelligence.-- Slow: Slows your opponent so the attacker gets 2 rounds to their 1. Duration of the spell could depend on Wizardry, Magic Defense and Intelligence.-- Invisibility: Makes the caster invis. Not stealthd, so if they walk into a room with people there it could say: Someone enters. Duration of the spell could depend on Wizardy, Conjuring and Intelligence.-- Etherealness: Makers the caster ethereal so they cannot be attacked in anyway. But if they attack then the affects of the spell are gone. Duration of the spell could depend on Wizardy, Magic Defense and Intelligence.-- True Seeing: Makes you see invisible people, Durtaion of the spell could depend on Conjuring and Intelligence.-- Colour Spray: This is an area affect spell similar to acidcone/ annihilate (only hits the targets you are fighting). Lowers the enemys Attack and Defense also has a chance to blind them. The amount of skill it would lower could depend on the casters Wizardry, Magic Attack and Intelligence. Duration of the spell would depend on the casters Wizardry, Magic Attack and Intelligence VS Their Constitution and Defense, if they're a mage Magic Defense would also be in this.-- Energywave: A 2 round move which hits all targets in the room (1st round casts the spell, 2nd round the spell hits). The caster summons all the energy from the room and rips it through their opponent causing alot of damage. Naturally the more oppenents the more MP it will cast. Damage would depend on the casters Wizardy, Magic Attack and Intelligence VS their Constitution, Defense and Magic Defense if they're a mage. This could also be the Wizards level 50 spell.Well they're all my ideas and i'm going to keep pesterting you guys untill at least 1-2 of them are in cause right now Wizards don't have much going for them in spells.Please other wizards post your thoughts.  --KaI.",]),(["size":701,"title":"Constructive Critisism","date":1067138077,"owner":"gromph","message":"I know it probally is spelt wrong. so sue me :Panyways sorry about the last post i just babbled about a prob and never gae any support to how it may be fixedjust some more ideas.. food for thoughtI like kais idea with that 2 round manna thing reminds me like FF IXanyways here is mineJust to go on the hole sanstorm idea Tornado... sandstorm but with more dmg manna cost maybe get it to do dmg over 2 rounds because the tornado lingers. but the wizard is still parred for the 2 roundsOr. im a big fan of lightning and Ice (all the DnD wizards are decked out with lightning and Cold Baced attacks)So giving there is no real ice spells cept for ice storm and freeze.

The spell would probably be magic attack/wizardry based. and defense against the spell would be wisdom/magic defense.The damage of this spell would probably be random since its different sizes of fire hitting the enemy and probably more than one things of fire could hit the enemy maybe 5 or 6 being limit?I dunno...it was just an idea that probably needs a lot more development...It was just one of those ideas you think of when you're bored :P-Anathema",]),(["size":107,"title":"wizard balance","date":1160588423,"owner":"nulvect","message":"I just switched wizards over to the new balance system.Your attack spells are probably a little stronger.",]),(["size":309,"title":"Fireworks","date":1184992154,"owner":"renner","message":"Had a thought about Fireworks.

Spells cool works well.Just wondering why the items on the mob vanish when you polythem. I figure that the spell is targeting the mob onlyand that if the mob did get effected by the spell that the itmes on the mob woudl drop to the ground. (ifthe poly turned them into a mob that couldnt wear the itmes)Somthing that jsut came to mind while was writing thiswas maby at low levels poly would effect the mob as a wholeeg mob and items  due to the fact that the low level wizards is unable to concentrate the magics that well.But at higher levels the wizard can control them betterand can target the mob only. That way the eq woudlntbe effected by the spell?On to CreateI was wondering it would be at all possable to alter thecreate spell to be a bit more specific?eg Create <armour> <helm>/<boots>/<gloves> etcThe same with Create weapons Eg Create <weapon> <blade>/<blunt> etc Also a quick question about Mage bags. Do they get bigger asthe mage gets bigger? Maby we could have the bags grow as the mage grows, low lvl mages can create bags, then bit highermaby a Mage Backpack..

Wizards MD not that great at this time and when it wears off you have to rub oil to regain the health again.  On the other hand when you put it on a mob since they dont have the ability to heal themselves it pretty much just brings down their dex, so their idles dont hit that hard since we dont do any physical abilities.
