I will be doing guild updates for Darksoul, Forsaken, and Unholy.  I'm not going to spend 2 weeks on one guild and then move to another, I'm going to keep available for guild updates pretty much forever, since that is how I think it should be.  Keep in mind, though, all spent time doing guild updates is time spent away from doing something else.  Also, keep in mind, I will be following most, if not all of the decisions Amun had made in the past.  Guilds will remain balanced. Here are a few notes:-Guild Dues will not be coming back.-Each guild may have 1 special item.-Armour and Weapons may be rebalanced to be useful, although they will not be stronger than anything in game.  Possibly scale with level, not sure.-There will be no teleportation portals.-Additional halls will be available, but again, no teleportation portals to them.-I will *ONLY* be working with the Guild Owners.  Councils and Masters must have their owner talk to me if they want something done.-I reserve the right to deny any request.Looking forward to talking with you guys soon, and getting some work done on your guilds!",]),(["size":196,"title":"2","date":1293482947,"owner":"vian","message":"Everything will be done on an individual basis.  Please send me a mudmail for what you want done, and I will read it and get back to you with how much it will cost.  We will then move from there.",]),(["size":1435,"title":"Ideas!","date":1295132083,"owner":"vian","message":"I will be going through all guild weapons and making them more useful, although they will NOT be as good as any items currently in the game by any means.  However, if you want to EXP with your guild's custom item to show guild pride, it will not be as harmful as it currently is to you.  Some things you guys could start requesting:  New items, and a 1 special custom item.  Perhaps some sort of special thing for all guilds to get, if anyone has any suggestions about guild limitations that would be nice too.I am currently thinking about a guild storage chest.  It would keep over reboot, but only 1 item will be storable per person at a time.  If A puts an item in, B can take it out, and then A's spot is open again.  It will basically be a storage that anyone can take from.  The big restriction on this that I see fit is, if I end up being able to put this in game, you would only be allowed to have 1 alt per guild to be safe and fair.  I like guilds, I want them to be better and more useful, and I want the smaller guilds to grow with our player base.  However, they will not end up being overpowered as they were in the past.  Things that get better may result in certain things getting \"worse\" to some people, yet better for balance and the ability for guilds to succeed and flourish.  It is a work in process, and will hopefully end up well.  Everyone's suggestions and feedback will help speed the process up well.",]),})
