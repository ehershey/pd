But kill the kataan fordoing it.dabs board board post #8 by Daboura, subject: assassin ideaassassins will be more ninja style characters. This means using a katana and stuff.dabs board board post #9 by Daboura, subject: legend ability/spellEvery subclass should get a subclass specific legend spell.Ok, an update to this idea. Every legend ability should require a unique item be used. Like for amage, a special wand would need to be equipted. For a fighter a special sword. This would mean you'dhave to quest for the legend ability/spell.dabs board board post #10 by Daboura, subject: paladinIn order to give paladins healing abilities, they will have to be loosing their 13 hp per con. thiscan be done in living.c around line 455.dabs board board post #12 by Daboura, subject: fightersSince having a bunch of different fighter attacks for different levels would be impossible, I thinkdoing a tiered system within the attacks themselves is the only good solution. So inside the attack,slash for example, at higher levels, I would message a single slash, and as the skill of the userincreased, it would message about getting in another hit, but instead of actually calculatinganother hit, I ould just change the modifier of the attack, ie 1.2, instead of 1.1. This would givethe illusion of more attacks, when it is really just one attack having it's damaged upped. This sortof thing should be in most of the fighter abilities, like slash, maul, and all that stuff.",]),(["size":379,"date":1152380415,"title":"useful info","owner":"nulvect","message":"him/her == tp->query_objective()his/her == tp->query_possessive()he /she == tp->query_subjective()string *somearr = filter( ({\"one\",\"two\",\"three\"}), (: $1[0..0] == \"t\" :) );somearr == ({\"two\", \"three\"})foreach (string blah in ({\"one\",\"two\"})) { print blah; } faster than for/whileadd_magic_protection(({\"limb\",amount,time}));limb == \"\" for allamount and time are ints",]),(["size":786,"date":1152422257,"title":"new bug","owner":"nulvect","message":"Error: *Bad argument 2 to exec()   Time: Sun Jul  9 01:09:58 2006   Current object: /adm/obj/simul_efun    Caller object: /adm/obj/login#2401    Current program: /adm/obj/simul_efun.c   File: \"/adm/simul_efun/overrides.c\" Line: 56---------- TRACE -
