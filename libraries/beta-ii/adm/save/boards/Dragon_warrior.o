This leads to 2 primary questions.1) Who do we want to run the guild?2) What criteria do we want for membership?There is currently a limit of 2 leaders for the guild, so if there are to be any new leaders, at least 3 of the current listed leaders would have to be demoted.  As i never wanted to be a guildleader, i have no problem with being demoted.  Whoever is leader would have to be on fairly often as these dues seem to be owed about twice a real time week.If anyone has any suggestions on either of these 2 questions please speak up.","title":"lead and member questions","size":692,"date":1139727194,"owner":"cortoth",]),(["message":"I'm humbled but thankful.
