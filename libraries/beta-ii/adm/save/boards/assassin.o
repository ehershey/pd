Maybe something assassins get lvl 30ish? like 'Diagnose'Diagnose endbringer     -He is in top shape.That way you can wait till they are at a disadvantage and then strike...which is part of the fine art of being a good assassin. :)The one Goblin rebellion Gob.",]),(["size":521,"date":1079893571,"title":"Unassassin-like Assassins","owner":"keirith","message":"ll								`q					~~qI'm being sociable and saying hi. so hi\".\"lFirst I will say that I like Gob's idea and second I add one of my own.Maybe I'm just wrong but aren't assassins suposed to be first strike killers? How many assassins has anyone heard of that don't kill their target on at least their second shot?I think an ability that allows a random (and rare) first strike kill should be considered. Unless there already is one and I'm just too low of level to know, in which cause just disreguard this post.",]),(["size":2047,"date":1135327771,"title":"Assassins","owner":"bellos","message":"Personally...I have two thoughts on new abils for assassins...First of all...We should know our tools of the trade...We should be able to point out a good quality dagger/knife.  I know we're not fighters, but we should be able to compare daggers/knives to eachother...just not other class weapons.Second...  Maybe another initiator gained at a higher level, between 20 and 40.  Perforate/puncture.  When backstabbing, you aim more carefully to hit a vital organ.  Perforate a kidney, puncture a lung etc.  Could be just automatically added onto backstab, so its a random occurrence right from the get-go...However with higher levels of skill, and level as well...it will happen more often.And i think i lied...3 things!Third...We do need another in-battle attack really...sure...we have Throw...but i doubt many of us wish to carry around a whole shwack of extra weapons to throw at enemies...and if in a pk event, risk losing them that way if they run away.Now...What exactly for assassins?  maybe something like... hell!  Why not an upgraded stab even!  Dual Stab! or...if thats not liked... since stab already does hit with each dagger...why not something along the lines of...GASH!  Gashing an opponent would open a large wound.  So it would do mean damage, and could cause weakening(although...i dont know if weakening occurs from bleeding...never seen anything bleed here...but bleeding things from Gash would be a nice additive wouldnt it!  Then you could make opponents lose hps etc on heartbeats until the bleeding stops...either through healing or natural clotting after an amount of time based on skill/level.that was a long bracket...yeesh...didnt even finish the bracket either...anyway.... just something fresh really...We are already a decently strong class...but we need something to keep our interest!  We get jab, then backstab, stab, throw...then at 50 circle...(more or less)  and thats it...we'll use backstab till the end of our days, and stab until we have circle...and then its backstab, circle till dest...",]),(["size":691,"date":1157889987,"title":"Slice","owner":"hamoto","message":"I had, after discovering I had slice, decided to go compare it to my stab.  It takes me the exact same amount of slices to finish my prey as it does stab.  While it is much more pleasant to look at with it's many colors, I find stab to be much more cost effective.Slice didn't sound all that entertaining an ability to begin with though.  I'd like to \"eviscerate\" someone.   It would be a powerful attempt at spilling your opponents intestines.  We are assassins.  Our business is death just like the ninjas of Japan.   Ever hunter learns his preys weaknesses and fully exploits then.  Just like shooting game in its vital organs in reality.Got bored, thought I'd run my mouth.Hammy",]),(["size":419,"date":1157890305,"title":"Poisons","owner":"hamoto","message":"I believe as assassins we would have knowledge of various poisons.  Our herbal knowledge would stem no further though.  I think we should have poisons that slow movement, paralyze, or deal damage.  The effects of the poison should be based upon the herbs used to make it.  Of course the various combinations to concoct such things should remain a secret for the individual assassin to discover for him/herself.Hammy",]),(["size":1424,"date":1202458078,"title":"assassin ideas","owner":"alexander","message":"Hamstring - Slicing/stabbing the hamstring, making running a dream to the enemy. A move such as 'hamstring' would be a great assassin ability due to the assassin is a killing machine, and to run away, just doesn't help out.Assassinate - Initiator. Assassins are meant to kill, they are evil things, hiding in shadows, striking fear in enemies. 'Assassinate' would be a final move, very high level requirement, skills would have to be maxed at that high level to even come close to touching it. Assassinate would be the initiator of initiators, it would be a backstab on steroids. When assassinating the assassin would attempt to puncture all main vital spots (heart, kidneys, etc, Nul, I'm sure you could find all the main ones).Now, this move probably sounds HIGHLY overpowered, BUT, you could do things to make that vary. Considering the assassin would have to thrust his daggers/knives extremely quickly to hit all vital spots before the enemy notices you can make it drain you completely of sp, so that way if the enemy didn't die, they'd have a fair advantage to take the assassin down. Or you could make it be a 2-turn starter, or something along the lines to make it a bit more fair.But it just seems like a move like that would be perfect, assassins are ruthless, and are meant to be one-shot killers. What better than stabbing all of the main vital spots?That's all for now, more later, hope you like.Alex",]),})
