The druid in question mutters some ancient arcane words causing the heat in the room to rise.  After a round or so the rays of the sun shine down causing damage to everything in the room.  If the casters nature and wisdom are high enough, they are able to defend against the damage.  If not, well, they get hurt too.  Maybe with this spell, it could have a chance to paralyze due to the intense light.Example:Ploo utters some ancient arcane words.Moose hits Ploo ineffectively in the torso with his right forehoof.The heat in the area begins to rise.Ploo dodges Moose's attack.Moose ducks out of the way.Rays from the sun shine brightly!The rays of the sun burn Moose!The rays of the sun burn Badger!The rays of the sun burn Bear!and so on...Just a thought...gimme suggestions....~Ploo, Nature's Wrath.",]),(["size":412,"title":"Spell","date":1153705823,"owner":"ploo","message":"Name: Ice ShieldStrengths: Nature, WisdomWeakness: Low Nature, Low WisdomDescription:The druid in question uses the power of ice to create a magical shield of ice which helps defend from blows during battle.  This spell could possibly be obtained at lvl 25-30? and improve its effects as levels grow. I'm kind of lost on a saying for it but ya, just a thought for a defensive spell.Ploo, Nature's Wrath",]),(["size":299,"title":"Spell","date":1153706027,"owner":"ploo","message":"Name: Calming WindStrengths: HealingDescription:The druid in question summons a gentle breeze to blow through the area/room using the element of air to heal his/her and his/her animals.

They will have buffs and defensive spells(and probably some healing spells) with an alignment of neutral (maybe bad) or higher.They'll have major destructive spells when neutral (maybe good) or lower. By 'major',I mean spells that hit the whole room for very high damage and very high cost.In concert, this means that druids at neutral alignment will have the most spells available.I also plan to make spells that are only useable during a certain mud season - 1 good and 1 evilfor each season.For the good spells I plan to keep the buffs mostly as they are. Attack spells will change, I'm sure.There will be several animal and plant related spells useable regardless of alignment so combatwill always be possible.That's what I've got thought out so far. Any ideas that fit into this layout will definitelybe thought about.",]),(["size":480,"title":"RE: Druids","date":1214016717,"owner":"bonnie","message":"Sounds like we have a lot to look forward to!In the help druid file its said that they are known for their devotion to goodness.I like the idea of neutral idea more, as if they are one with nature and nature more or less being a neutral element in its selfit makes sencse that druids would reflect thatand then dabble slightly in going a little to either side of that neutrality.Any hoo, sounds awsome. Am looking forward to it Nulvect!Bonnie \"Breathe deep, seek peace\"",]),(["size":65,"title":"x","date":1224266822,"owner":"cenn","message":"So if we go above neutral, we would lose the neutral AoE spells?",]),(["size":311,"title":"re: cenn","date":1224291595,"owner":"nulvect","message":"I don't plan for there to be specifically neutral aoe spells.Any mass attacks would be available from somewhere around neutral (maybe one notch higher)down to satanic.
