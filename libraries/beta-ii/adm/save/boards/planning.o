Basically, it'll still announce auctions, but you must be at the auction house in order to bid or pick up the item. This prevents long distance magical transport of items, and presents a much more realistic way for it to work.The current plan is to give 1-2 minutes after an auction is announced before it actually begins, then basically use the same rules in effect now, with the exception that you must be physically present to bid.I plan on making this into an inherit or daemon so that there can be several auction houses, all auctioning different things simultaniously.Also, I plan on letting the auctioner use the 1-2 minute gap to set ONE minimum bid on their item, but once the auction starts, they aren't allowed to bid. Also, if they mess up, too bad, they get one shot at setting the minimum.The idea right now is that I'll actually keep track of everything, ei, how much gold someone bid, how much an item sold for, etc, and if someone isn't present at the time a new bid is entered, or the item is won, etc., they have to go to the auctioneer mob and 'claim' their gold or items.I know it's crazy, but it's much more realistic; I love the idea. If you have any comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc., please discuss on the wizlounge board.Thanks",]),(["size":1561,"title":"arlon coastline","date":1163578084,"owner":"nulvect","message":"Tonight I was fixing up the sky map to match the ocean map,and I realized that the way to get to Arlon makes it feel likeit's much more south than the map shows.

Pyro reminded me of it yet again so I am going to post it here so everyone can have a shot at helping to plan this project. Vian and Daos are working on the newbie quest which will help newbies learn how to mud here. I think we should extend it to a continuing quest. Basically in the newbie quest the players parents will die. The neverending quest of the player will be to find out who killed their parents and why. We could quietly add small additions in each area of the mud, hidden when possible, to keep them going on this quest. It would reward them each time they solve part of the puzzle with xp and maybe a new item or whatever. I believe this might help draw more players into the mud with a storyline, alternate to the exploring for the sake of exploring, and give some people a reason to stay, explore, and go beyond the current level idling that happens. Some parts of the quest players would have to be high levels to solve, or even reach, such as a parts we can hide in Purg, drow, etc.A story driven aproach to mudding if you will. Instead of go forth and conquer the mud one area at a time, it will be go forth and find those who wronged you and killed your parents. Please post your thoughts, ideas, objections, and anything else you think about this here. I would love to hear everyone's input.

I think it should maybe change at points though.  Quest 1 in the newbie quest, find the person who killed your parents, the bandit.  The bandit tells you that you'll never find the person who hired him, and then your quest is to find that person.

Perhaps the surrounding forests should be 10-25, moving Citrin to 30, Lodos and Roston to 30-34(similar to Tene currently is).

Instead,we could implement a system where spells and abilities have to be trainedfrom various 'master' mobs that would be around the mud.To elaborate:Let's take mages, for example. Since they are supposed to spend theirlives learning magic, you could make them learn their abilities fromother mages around the realm.  If a mage monster knows the spell 'foo',then a player could potentially perform a deed or quest for that monster,and then train exp like skills in order to learn the spell from thatmonster.So the head mage of Borgdom knows foo, but his realm is overrun byundead.  If the player clears the realm of undead for the mage, thatplayer can then train however many thousands of exp it would take tolearn the spell foo.There are a couple advantages to this:Firstly, this system would fit more closely into the idea that mages,fighters, whatever, have to spend time learning their abilities.Secondly, it makes questing a little bit more mandatory if you wantthe best characters.  If a monster has a spell you really want, youhave to quest for it in order to be able to find that spell, and thenon top of that, you have to satisfy whatever the requirements arefor the monster to teach you the spell.Thirdly, this allows you to take charge of more customization of yourcharacter.  It means that every level 50 mage of subclass x will nothave the same set of abilities.  In fact, if we wanted to, we couldcap the number of spells of a certain rank that each player couldlearn, allowing you to better taylor your character to the way youwant to play it.  To this extent, you could even make mages subclass-less, in as much as you could make spells of a certain school affectwhether or not you can learn spells from a different school.  Sayyou want to learn a powerful necromancer spell, but you already havea lot of wizardry spells.  Then the mage won't let you learn it, butyou could still potentially, at high enough levels, learn low levelnecromancer spells at the expense of higher level wizard spells, etc.It wouldn't be terribly difficult to implement, and it could overallmake the class more fun to play.Feedback, as always, is encouraged.-Drack",]),(["size":254,"title":"on planning","date":1270859032,"owner":"daos","message":"I think it is a great idea and would make the spell/ability system more interesting.

The parent has made arrangements and if the player will just choose their class and subclass, they can get started straight away. The player should be given the oppertunity to choose thier class/sub here.After choosing their class and sub the player should be led to a basement where they can get gear appropraite to their subclass, decent eq, weapons, some oil,some stones if needed, and about 2k gold. A rat promptly attacks the player where they learn about combat. After killing the rat they are led back upstairs where they can learn about whatever they have not been taught so far.
