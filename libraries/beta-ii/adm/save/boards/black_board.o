But with a twist. Much like the flamewallspell of pyros, and the Pets of Necros. The caster would summon the Orb to follow them, the orb would \"defend\" so to speakthe caster performing a random attack at random times duringcombat.a copy of the spell from dnd is the following.yellow = daze/stunred = fire dmggreen = poisonturquoise = lightningblue = iceviolet = psi dmg.I dont know how it would work, because the orb wouldnt have anyphycial attacks, just the random spell at random times. Iam pretty sure nothing attacks a pyros firewall even thoughit deals dmg?It was a thought. Trying to think of some new high level spells.let me know what you think!",]),(["size":185,"date":1327944475,"title":"Re: lvl60+ spell","owner":"nulvect","message":"That's actually a really good idea, I think it fits perfectly.It will take a while to code, with all the different effects,but I'll try to squeeze it in between other things soonish.",]),(["size":69,"date":1328014960,"title":"Re: lvl60+ spell","owner":"orcha","message":"Nice, ill be keen to see what you come up with!Now back to xping :)",]),})
