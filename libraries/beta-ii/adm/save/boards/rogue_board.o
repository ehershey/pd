Rangers and scouts, depending on nature skill level (give nature to scouts) are able to apply first aid items to others, such as oil and ointment. Also, the scout or ranger gains a moderate bonus in the effectivity of the healing item when used on itself.The bonus in effectivity could go up with nature skill. For instance, oil heals about 200 hp and 100 sp. With a scout or ranger that has 100 nature, hp would go up 300 and sp 150. At a certain level of nature, the scout or ranger would then gain the ability to <first aid> player. ",]),(["size":839,"date":1142818568,"title":"Idea","owner":"roronoa","message":"Well I wanted to put out some of my ideas and others in meld it together for some crap i thought up of (and others)                                                 First off with scouts i wanted to put out 3 abilities they should get one of them was from trooper its called first aid, the other powerwalk, and the third would be called scavenge. First off with first aid trooper basically explains it all(Read 78) and i totally liked the whole idea of scouts being nature-like so it sounds good to me. To give the whole nature look a brush i wanted to add in something like a powerwalk where the scout basically remembers 5 places and speedwalks over there. The other is called scavenge i thought it would work out in such a way where the scout could go hunt for an item so it would make them the ultimate in searching for armour/eq etc. ",]),(["size":279,"date":1143150074,"title":"thief idea","owner":"victor","message":"Because if a thief is attacked they are pretty much sol I was thinking they should a traps maybe have a trap skill or whenever you raise stealing you get traps. actually because all rogues get stealing everyone could get traps just thieves would be the best.

Earlier today oh, 10 minutes ago or so, I just found out that cenn can hit me with backstab. With his dex vs. mine and skills considered, shouldn't that be an overlooked part?

I'm only concerned with the fact that someone with lower dex can hit me. (I understand skills come into play) So thats why I give it 40 dexterity. At the most. So other than that the new bs Kicks ass, and for that matter, so does ambush, although it's like bs and the hit ratio needs to be modified as well. Again I've bitched about this and sorry, I was in a bad mood today for other reasons and didn't mean to take it out on the entire MUD.. it happened that way.
