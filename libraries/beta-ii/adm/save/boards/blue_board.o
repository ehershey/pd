For example, bite could cause rapid freezing of whatever limb was bitten and do extra body damage, swoop would include ice shards being shot down while the dragon is in flight for extra damage, etc etc.If not that, perhaps something like a move called Frostbite. It bites, and while the dragon is biting, it shoots supercold air on the limb and makes it useless for a short while, kinda like pin. I guess it would pretty much be pin...maybe not the most original idea. Maybe it will help spawn other ideas though.",]),})
