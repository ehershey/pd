Do we want to do them as a wholeseparate class, or as a subrace and people keep their existing class??Doing them as a subrace makes the most sense to me, but it's also the mostdangerous balance-wise. After discussing it with a friend, I think allowingmost races to become vampire would be best. Raknids would not be able tobecome vamp, because they're just far too different.Either way, I want to have more abilities that unlock with age. I've postedmany abilities for vamps on this board, so I'd like some feedback and/orother ideas. Perhaps we can have groups of related abilities and people canchoose what path to follow as they age??Also, I probably will not be using the quest layout from Amun and Eiosverbatim, but modifying it a bit. The general idea is great, it just hastoo many sections and is a little repetitive I think. More suggestions arewelcome on this front.Edit: I forgot to mention, but other quest races will not be vampire-capable.This includes angels, demons, dragons, and (someday) liches.","size":1141,"title":"vampires","date":1290128771,"owner":"nulvect",]),(["message":"I like the idea of them being a full race/class more than the subrace idea, to be honest.  I do like the idea that maybe only Humans and possibly Elves could become vampires.  This makes sense to me as vampirism seems to be a plague affecting humans only, and I haven't heard of it affecting any other races in lore.  How exactly will the age thing work though?  Will stats/skills not help as much as age?  Also, if we do them as a subrace, will people know they are vampires?  I kind of think if its a subrace, people should have to keep it secret, as Vampires should be free-PK and you can PK them at will.  If its a subrace, to me it feels as if it should be obtainable through a bite, although with our playerbase, it seems like if it is that way everyone would be a vampire within a day.  I dunno if our players would be able to handle the RP-esque secrecy of it.  All in all, I think its best for it to be a separate class completely, especially with all the spells/skills you've already thought up, which look pretty good to me.  I don't know what you mean by more vamps == weaker?  As more people make vampires, older vampires will be weaker?  If its a quest, it seems as if they will be bit by the same vampire, which means their potency should be just as strong.  And if max HP is based on level/age, maybe they should have constitution taken out.  Maybe a few stats shouldn't be there for vampires, and be replaced with age.  But is age playtime, or character age?  And does the age start when the person becomes vampire, not when their character is made?","size":1571,"title":"x","date":1290175852,"owner":"vian",]),(["message":"I think that vampirism being a 'plague' is exactly why it should be a subrace.You don't lose your old memories or skills, your body is still (mostly) the same,but now you're just... changed a bit.I believe as a subrace they would want to keep it a secret... or we should givethem a good reason to want to do so, such as the free pk thing. Also, the ideais that spreading the blood thinner among more vampires will make them allweaker (after a point). That's meant to be a major detriment to leaking the quest.As for player vamps making more vamps... I'm not sure. It might work if weput in enough reasons why people won't want to just go around making them.Age will be a major contributor to vampire abilities, as measured from when theybecame a vampire, probably just in character age. I don't think age should replaceanything, just become its own factor. Max hp will work like it does now, just withdifferent modifiers: level * x + con * y, with higher x and/or y. Mainly becausehp is their \"blood\" that they will use up for vampire abilities.As for my balance problem - adding vamp abilities to someone with an existing class -I think I came up with a solution. We could add different abilities based on theirclass, so fighter vamps would learn more combat/strength based abils, rogues wouldlearn more stealth/dex stuff, etc.I really think we should go with the subrace idea. Every modern vampire mythosdepicts it as changing you, but not remaking your body from scratch, not erasingyour memories, just giving you extra powers along with some major drawbacks.","size":1588,"title":"Re: x","date":1290187114,"owner":"nulvect",]),(["message":"I prefer the subrace idea.
