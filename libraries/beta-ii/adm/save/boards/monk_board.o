Since we are not magic users but we are in tune with our \"chi\" I think this move would suit nicely.Channel - Using out spiritual connection we channel our mp into our sp.Takes all of your manapoints and Greatly boost your stamina regeneration for a short ammount of time. So if i had 500 mp it would give me +50 sp for 5 rounds, IF i had 1000 mp it would give me +50 sp for 10 rnds. In doing this it give us monks a reason to train all of our stats instead of just out combat orientated ones.DarkLord Lucifer Prince of Darkness",]),(["size":1833,"title":"'ideas'","date":1160925750,"owner":"vayne","message":"abil name: multikickthe enhanced version of circlekick this abil would hit the opponent multiple times depending on skill level with each kick, im guessing a 30ish lvl abilabil name: assailthis would be a series of quick punches that would hit at multiple times at the opponentabil name: doomblowan elite abil this should be a finishing blow that would depend on the victims hp if its 1/4 lower it should finish it off (replacement for eagleclaw)abil name: collidethis abil would be used as an init to run straight at the opponent and knock him down to the floor and *hopefully* crush him in the process, the user would take some damage as wellabil name: heave/takedownthis abil would be a lvl 20ish abil used to slam the opponent to the ground and maybe paralyze him for a cpl roundsabil name: meditatethis abil would be used to keep the opponent aware of his opponent and dodge his abils/spell in the processabil name: furythis abil would be the monks own type of rage to use a series of multiple kicks and punches in a combo to finish the opponent would prolly take in multikick/assail in it almost like the berserker rage*a note on heave/takedown* if heave is being used it should also have a 50/50 chance to take the opponent out to the next room to give the monk a breather or chance to regain staminaabil name: trancean enhanced form of rest allows the user to regain stamina/energy fasterabil name: combo*s*this would be used for the more stronger monk to be able to use abils in unison with eachotherfor example: assail/takedown punch the opponent furiously multiple times and toss him immediately to the next room or using a multikick and when landed on the ground assault the player with a doomblow *not entirely sure* how this would work but i was trying to toss some ideas out there",]),(["size":949,"title":"New Abilities/Ideas","date":1218729933,"owner":"aethion","message":"I haven't gotten very far as monk yet so I don't know all of the moves we get but, here are some suggestions.Bicycle Kick - We've all seen Liu Kang do it in Mortal Kombat. Could be a cool elite move.Throw/Trip - Something that throws the attacker to the ground and does damage. Maybe potential for stun. Sweepkick - You sweep your leg into the ankles of the attackers causing them to fall. The only difference between this and Throw/Trip is that it's an area ability.Something that allows us to regen hp/sp/mp at a higher rate for some amount of time. The rate at which vitals regen and length of spell would be dependant on stats/skills... Maybe you could add a new skill called \"Chi\", \"Meditation\", \"Focus\".More area abilities!!! Xping 1v1 gets old.More body damage!!! :PIf Supplication doesn't already raise attack/melee, then it should!Circlekick could have an area ability alternate like \"Circlekick all\". More area abilities!",]),(["size":186,"title":"magic attack going away","date":1234851799,"owner":"nulvect","message":"I just want to let people know ahead of time, your magic attack skillwill be removed in the next skill update.

Maybe 3-4 rounds of steady sp regen. So we could 'mantra' then attack and sp stays up a little better than just burning it out in the first couple rounds. It would extend our combat a little longer than normal since we don't have to use other items to gain sp back. Since it already has an internal cooldown I don't think it is a bad idea.
