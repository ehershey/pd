Names shall be of a fantasy nature to fit in with the mud's fantasy:|    setting. It is for the admins to decide if a name is not of a fantasy:|    nature. In most cases, use of actual words is not allowed. No phrases,:|    no proper names of places or people, no names from famous works, no use:|    of any race, class, or subclass in a name, and no misspellings of any:|    of these. Rulings on questionable names will be at staff discretion.:|    This rule was created Jan 17th, 2006, and pertains to all characters:|    created after that date.:|    Examples of disallowed names::|    Newb, Dontkillme, Murderer, Orcguy, Bilbo, Washington:| :| 2. The Primal Darkness Staff is not allowed to help mortals in any way:|    unless it is to fix some kind of bug. Do not ask a Staff member for:|    information that you know would be breaking the rules. Staff who break:|    this rule are subject to punishment just like anyone else.:| :| 3. You may not harass anyone. Harassment is persistently targetting one:|    player or group of players in a negative way after being asked to stop.:|    Harassment is not tolerated on Primal Darkness.:| :| 4. Spamming lines, says, tells, shouts, boards, or any other form of:|    communication is not allowed. Spamming is repeating something over:|    and over to annoy others. Spamming is harassment.:| :| 5. Offensive material is not allowed in any public display. This includes:|    profane language, racial slurs, and discussion of lewd behavior, among:|    other things. It is ok in private communications as long as everyone:|    listening is ok with it. If someone asks you to stop using that language:|    to them or around them, please respect their wishes. If you repeatedly:|    ignore someone asking you to stop, it becomes harassment. Even if you think:|    something is not offensive, someone else may think it is. Public displays:|    include open lines, boards, says, finger info, titles, movement messages,:|    and basically anything any other player can see.:| :| 6. Do not talk about other muds on open lines or boards. All too often, these:|    discussions lead to heated comparisons and slander. We want every player:|    to start with a blank slate upon entering Primal Darkness for the first:|    time, so we ask that you try not to judge people here based on their:|    actions on other muds. Do not bash any players or staff from other muds.:| :| 7. The auction line: Do not put worthless or very common items such as:|    stones, oil, or meat up for auction except in bulk in a container.:|    If your item doesn't sell, you must wait at least 10 minutes before:|    trying to auction it again.:| :| 8. Using color or misleading information to hide your enter and exit:|    messages is not allowed. An exit message should have a perfectly:|    clear indication of which direction you leave in.:| :| 9. It is illegal to give away any quest or deed information for any:|    reason. Quests may be done with other players, but all players must be:|    actively questing. You may not finish a quest, and another person just:|    solves the end of it. The locations of all subclass halls are considered:|    quest info, to encourage newbies to explore.:| :| 10. Scripting is not allowed. Scripting is having a program playing the:|     game for you. Triggers, macros, and other client-side conveniences are:|     ok as long as you are at the keyboard. If you are not at your keyboard,:|     your character must be idle.:| :| 11. The delivery system: Use of any form of movement that does not involve:|     you entering a command for each room that needs to be traversed is:|     illegal while doing deliveries. This includes speed walks, gate, and fly.:| :| 12. Bugs will happen, but exploiting them is not allowed and is considered:|     cheating. If you find a bug, use the <bug> command to report it and do not:|     try to use the bug again. Do not spread knowledge of bugs to other players.:|     Examples of bugs::|     gaining exp with little or no effort; advancing skills, stats, or levels:|     without effort or exp; mobs that don't fight back; buying an item at a:|     shop for 0 money; using many spells or abilities in the same round; etc...:| :| 13. Feeding is not allowed. This is when someone sits in a party and does:|     nothing to help, but gains exp only because someone else is earning it.:|     If your position in the party does not involve killing, you must be with:|     someone else in the party, not sitting in a safe room using long distance:|     spells. Getting around the restrictions on levels within a party is:|     considered a form of feeding, since the restrictions are in place to make:|     sure everybody is fairly equal in strength.:| :| 14. Character sharing is not allowed. This is when a single character is played:|     by two or more people at different times.:| :| 15. Multiplay is not allowed. This is when two or more characters which belong:|     to a single player interact in some way. This includes transfer of any:|     items or money, avenging the death of another of your characters, asking:|     someone to log on an alternate character to help you, or granting such a:|     request. Helping someone to transfer anything between their characters:|     is as illegal as doing it yourself. No player may have more than one of:|     his characters logged on at any given time, which includes link-dead:|     characters. You must completely log off all characters before logging in:|     with a different one, you cannot just go link-dead.:|     Staff members may log on a test character for debugging purposes.:| :| 16. LANs: If you wish to have multiple people play from the same LAN at once,:|     you must first contact an Admin and request to be allowed LAN access.:|     Players on a LAN may party together, but may not exchange any items or:|     money. Stealing from, looting, or killing players while on a LAN is:|     forbidden.:| :| 17. Player killing is allowed on Primal Darkness. You must be level 20 before:|     you can PK or be PKed. You must wait 5 days between PKs of the same:|     character. The victim may seek revenge by PKing his killer back, but:|     must observe the 5 day waiting period after his revenge PK. During the:|     5 day waiting period, any purposeful attack against that victim is:|     considered illegal, regardless of whether it results in the victim's death.:|     If the victim attacks you and dies, it is his own fault, not yours.:|     If you belong to a guild, this rule applies to your entire guild rather:|     than just to you. Any attempt to get around this by inducting or removing:|     members will result in punishment for the entire guild. PK in a nopk zone:|     such as Tirun is also illegal and is considered bug abuse.:|     If you control or otherwise purposely manipulate a mob so that it kills:|     a player, including attacking someone who is already fighting a mob so:|     that the mob will land the last hit, you are still subject to this rule.:|     If you assist someone else to PK, you are still subject to this rule.:|     If a victim is killed by a mob while running away from a player or group:|     of players, everyone is still subject to this rule.:|     Killing of outlaws is not subject to this rule.:|     Unrestrained PK of many people in a short period of time is considered:|     a PK spree and is illegal. Additionally, multiple PK attempts against:|     the same target in a short period of time can be considered harassment,:|     though this is up to the discretion of the staff.:| :| 18. Stealing kills is not allowed. If someone is killing a mob, you can't:|     join them, help them, take their kill while they rest one room away,:|     or loot the corpse when they are done unless you are partied together.:| :| :|   We are all here to have fun. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.:|   Punishments will vary, but the penalty for breaking any rule may range:|   up to complete banishment and deletion of all of the offending player's:|   characters. Use common sense when deciding anything. Admins do and will:|   update these rules as needed. We will try to notify players of changes,:|   but we suggest reading the rules at least on a monthly basis.:| :| ",]),(["size":376,"date":1165417614,"title":"remort system","owner":"stormbringer","message":"I have been thinking on it and I think we should change remort.Instead of being able to remort into a class/subclass the remort should make a player remort to a child where they will have to go choose their class/subclass from the class halls.

The vampires only help you because you help them,for example. Most of this will be taken care of with dialog andvisions and stuff.Levels 20-25Go to the Pale-skinned man in the underground part of the graveyard.He is a vampire, and he needs you to get him some blood. You mustbring him a severed limb so he can drink the blood out of it.(That part is a little iffy)Out of gratitude, he will give you an old vampire's fang.He will put you into a trance and you will have a vision of the next part.Levels 30-35This part can only be done during dusk on Qualtiar 13th.You have to go to a hidden room in lodos that has a blood-stained altar.You need to get a poison tea from a ranger and pour it over the blood,then consume the blood somehow (lick it up, I guess).This will make you lose some stat points.The top of the altar will slide off, revealing a mirror.When you take it, you get another vision of the next part.Levels 40-45When you kill the merk queen, a book falls onto the altar there, whichyou take to the sage in merk. He'll say it talks about a sandbar withsomething that needs to be dug up. You go to the sandbar and dig upa coffin (belonging to Drac, a mob in the eye of hell). You'll needeither the ruby key (from killing merk queen) or a lockpickto open the coffin, either way you have to get your blood on itbefore it works.In the coffin is the Daywalker Cloak, and a riddle written in blooddirecting you to the next part.Levels 50-55In the haunted house in tirun, there's a room where you search shadows,leave \"shadows\", and wind up outside in the back yard. Here you need to\"enter mist\" which will take you to a small area with lots of swarming vampiremobs (but they don't auto attack). You need some previous items to getthrough that exit. Through here, you'll find a young girl. You capture her in the mirror.As soon as you do, a bat flies down and attacks you. You kill the bat.You must eat it afterwards. Eating it will lower your stats a bit. At thispoint, the girl's voice from the mirror yells something about her father,who will be some mob already in the game, probably in roston. When yougo to him, he'll hear his daughter's cries and see what you're trying tobecome, and cast a spell that teleports you into a room with a vampire slayer.You have to kill her and get her key to get out of the room.The key has an inscription telling you about the next part.Levels 60-65You need to be demonic or satanic, and have a minimum stat totalas well as a minimum con stat.You go to Drac in the eye of hell in inferi and show him the mirror.He'll ask if you really want to become a vampire, and if so he'llsend you to another hidden room in lodos that has a mirror and a corpse in it.He will communicate with you telepathically, telling you to place the mirroryou carry in a certain spot so it faces the other one.*The mirror thing is probably only possible at night*This will release the girl inside the mirror, but the magic also brings thecorpse to life, and it tries to attack her. You have to kill the corpse andsave the girl so Drac can drink her blood. A note will fall from the corpsewith a spell written on it, that teleports you and the girl back to Drac.Drac drinks her blood and offers you some. When you drink it, it is sostrong with magic that you pass out.You wake up in a hall of mirrors. It's a maze, and you're simply lookingfor the room that doesn't have your reflection in it. In that room you\"smash mirror\" and go through a door behind it into a brightly lit area.The sun here hurts you unless you wear the daywalker cloak.After passing through here, you come to a gate. You use the fang you got atthe beginning to open it. As soon as you pass through the gate, the fangvanishes. A room or two later you collapse in pain as your own fangs grow out.You go through another small area and find the Elder Vampire. He talksto you telepathically and says his body is an illusion, and he was the batyou ate. Now you have to cut your stomach open to release him.He takes his true form and asks if you want to become a vampire. If not,you'll just bleed to death from cutting yourself open. If so, he'll drinkfrom you and you drink from him. The pain of transformation makes youpass out again.You wake up in the underground grave area (new room probably) and are toldthat you must stay there for a full 24 hours (of unidle time). You'll haveyour start room set and all. This may be where their hall is located.After the time is up, you'll be a full-fledged vampire.Note that Carina and Eios came up with most of this, and I justguided them a little.

Normally, global actions will be addedfirst, through the normal login procedure or through the commandhook, followed by foreground actions (items added to a player'sinventory, etc), and finally with background actions, to be addedand removed from the player's verb list liberally, called oftenby random objects that may be moved to a from a player's inventoryfor small time periods, or by rooms that players may enter andthen leave.Because of this inherant logic, notify_fail was created withthe intention of beginning at the top of the verb list, wherethe most recent actions were added, and then falling through thebottom. It seems almost paradoxical that these items, which areconsidered the most important, and the first to be attempted tobe executed, are also considered the least important in terms oferror messages, so that people are not even notified of the action'sattempted execution should there be a lower level action that wascalled that also does not fit.That begs the question, what of the actions that are at the topof the user's verb list, but that are to be considered morelikely to have been attempted to have been executed than thecommands below them? For instance, imagine a scenario in whicha player is moved into a room, in which there is a large glowingsand bag, that the player has to <slam> with their fist in orderto continue through their quest, or to trigger a special event?The player's verb list might look something like this:<slam> : background action, added by room to create the         new command to slam the sandbag<slam> : global action, added by the combat file as an         attack available to that playerImagine that the player types <slam sandbag with foot>. Thebackground action examines the input, determines it to beinsufficient to trigger the command, and wants to tell the playerwhy. However, the command doesn't want the player to berestricted from executing any other lower level <slam> verbs,should they exist. As such, slam returns a notify_fail(),with a customized string explaining to the player that yes,there is indeed a way to slam the sandbag, but that the commandfailed because they used the wrong limb to try to slam thebag with.as such, this notify_fail() releases the verb from the currentfunction, so that it may seek lower level functions to attemptto execute, while also giving it a message that may be printedshould there be no other lower level verbs to execute.The torch is then passed to the global action, so that itmay . The problem stems from the fact that notify_fail assumedthat the latest function is the most important function, andthat the error message for that one is the one that should beprinted, as it is clearly the more important function. Whatnotify_fail fails to take into account is that this secondcommand, the attack, is something which this player usesevery day, at least 50 times a day, and is perfectly familiarwith the syntax and the requirements for the command. They didindeed mean to slam the sandbag, and when they see the errormessage for the attack, they will assume that the sandbag simplecannot be interacted with (and it is true that an unfortunatelysmall number of items in the MUD can be interacted with). Assuch, it is of the utmost importance that the slam message forthe sandbag is printed, rather than the attack. In that case,a programmer may even opt to simply have their command return 1after printing an error message, which stops the verb listfrom executing any further commands. That's all well and good,but what if there is also a strong monster in that room thatthe player has to attack before they continue, but they findthemselves unable to properly kill the monster because everytime they try to slam it they get an error message aboutsome sort of sand bag that they really don't care about right now.I have multiple solution suggestions that may help us out withthis dilema. The general idea is that notify_fail should knowmore about the different error messages that are queueing up,vying to be printed. This can be accomplished in multiple ways.Yo ucan have each function tell notify_fail exactly how importantits own error message is, but with something like that we wouldhave to map out general uses and function types that would callnotify fail, so that a priority tree for different applicationscan be created, which can hopefully be used as a catch-all, orat least a catch-most guideline for which error message shouldbe printed over others. This may tend to follow the generalcommand type listed above, with special between-types to beused when a function's error message is meant to overwrite,or be more important than, other normal funcions that wish toreturn error messages in that specific function group.The second possible solution is thatnotify_fail could simply be passed information about the natureof the error that has occured, and work with it from that point.For example, if the notify_fail() has to try to chose betweentwo functions, one which failed because the user simply did noteven follow the proper format for the command, and one whichfailed because the user inputted the proper format but did notactually have the item that they referenced, or because theitem that they referenced is not in the room, or becausethe item that they referenced is currently not accessable tothat command, it is likely in most situations that the seconderror message is the one that should be printed.of course, this does not address the situation in which onecommand is added to the player in an effort to restrictusage of that command with specific items or in specificsitutaions, or to overwrite the normal error message withsomething more fitting (such as overwriting a 'get' in aroom so that when a player tries to get an item that doesnot exist it prints something explaining why the itemis accessable, rather than simply saying that it is not.)In that case, we could create a new system in which youcan override a specific command, so that should that commandbe executed in the player's verb list, the error messagecan be printed, rather than executing that command.This is, of course, not to say that these two solutions aremutually exclusive. It is indeed possible that notify_failcould be passed as much information as possible, whereit runs the information received through its own What if there had been a third verb as part of the player'sverb list:<slam> : global action, added by the social system, an         emote that sends the player's environment the message: \"<player name> slams his/her fists into the ground and roars!\"This is a contingency addressing a situation which isn'tcontained within the boundaries of what I had originally set outto address with this writing, but at long as I have theopportunity to address it now without great further explanation,I may as well do so.In this situation, even with the solutions given above, everythingmay not work given as intended. In the best possible case, theslam sandbag error will be queued, the slam attack error messagewill be ignored, but as the command tree passes finally to thisemote action, they will find themselves attacking the ground,rather than seeing a helpful error message explaining why thesandag attack did not work. In this case, it may even be consideredpreferred to have the emote action completely ignored, even thoughit would have worked without issue, so that the player mayinstead be able to see the error message, which can be consideredto be of greater importance than the sandbag.Of course, the sandbag command cannot simply attempt to return 1,for as mentioned above, that restricts use of any other command aswell. It is also unfeasable to notify the emote system to onlywork when there is no notify_fail, as there may indeed be situationswhen the emote is intended, and the failure message is incosiquential.In that case, I find the best solution may be to have notify_failonce again analyze the importance of the error message, and comparethat to the importance of the command. If the sandbag slam failed utterlybecause the player didn't even type anything close to even havingconcerned the sandbag, then it may be the better option to havethe emote be executed.",]),(["size":1430,"date":1219641578,"title":"add_action, notify_fail","owner":"nulvect","message":"Pyro has quite verbosely described the problems with our current add_action and notify_fail systemfor giving new commands to players.The newest command gets priority, and you only have two choices for processing:yes this is the command, stop processingno this is the wrong command, keep processing, and hey if no one else sets a fail message, use thisUnfortunately these are inherent to our mudlib. I am trying to remove themfrom all lib objects (that is, make it so every weapon in the game doesn't give youits own copy of the wield command), but it's going slowly.When using your own add_actions, you should try to make it as obviousas possible what command should be used. _Nobody_ likes guessing syntax.Try to avoid very common verbs if possible.On a side note, there is a 'verb' system in newer mudlibs that sets up abunch of special verb commands (touch, push, slam, etc) which check predeterminedfunctions to see if you can do that verb to that thing.For example: push pyro, checks if there is a function called direct_push_ob() in pyroand if it returns 1 then he can be pushed.

These 'failures' can then be used in conjunction with how much they have accomplished at the end of the event to decide what reward they will get. For instance, somebody who 'fails' a lot may receive an object of severely degraded quality, rather than an epic reward. The players could also be rewarded a static number of tokens or event credits that they can accumulate through all future events and use later to buy specific event rewards at some event shop. These tokens will be tracked by a daemon and not held by players, so they cannot be traded nor stolen.Issue:  Players may not tell other players about what is going on with an event because they themselves did not see it or were not paying attention, or because they want to be the sole person to solve the event and get rewarded.  Because of this, the number of participators drops consistantly throughout the event, until by the end there is only a small number of people participating, even though the rest would have liked to join in.  Also, there is a lot of room for communication breakdown when everybody runs off in all directions in search of the next stage of a quest, and everybody may simply be left confused about what is going on, about what exactly they are supposed to be doing, or what has been told. This issue is compounded when you take into account things which are only shown to players once, such as scripted conversations from important monsters.  This also brings up issues of players not actually knowing exactly where the front lines are, and of lower level players not being able to get to where the event is happening, even if the event is designed to accomodate somebody of their level, because it may be in a location that contains higher level monsters than they would be able to take on, or because everybody keeps telling them that they are simply too low of a level.Solution:  Instead of throwing the players in situations where there is a specific front line throughout the event, and anybody not on the front line is left in the cold, it would be better to have events where you can see a clear path from the beginning of an event to an end.  To this end, it would be better to avoid preplanned speeches and include more static hints, which will leave a firm trail behind them. A good example would be the old dragon quest, anybody could walk into the house and figure out on their own that they need to open the fireplace, the only difference would be that the fireplace would be already open by the time they got there. They also could then get into the next room and further figure out on their own what book to press, although it wouldn't matter because the path would be clear - the bookcase would already be open.  However, this solution does change the nature of events quite a bit, and does manage to remove a lot of the group spirit of events, where everybody works together to try to figure out a soulution to this global problem.  An idea that I had is some kind of central quest hub, maybe in the same location as the event vendor that I mentioned previously. The idea behind the quest hub is that, whenever anybody accomplishes anything within the event, that information is logged within the quest hub, so that anybody can come by and read up on everything that has happened so far. They can then also use the hub to teleport to the front lines of the event.  Using this event as an example, I've made a little mockup of what it would look like:====( Event Status )============================================%^GREEN%^ [ 1] A dragon appears over tirun [ 2] The beaches of the dragon lands are found%^YELLOW%^*%^RESET%^[ 3] Talk to the dragon elder%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ [  ] ??? [  ] ??? [  ] ??? [  ] ??? [  ] ??? [  ] ??? [  ] ???%^RESET%^================================================================> check 1%^BOLD%^A blue dragon appeared over the skies of tirun, circled a few times, then landed to find Geddoe, Stormbringer, Yang, Nulvect, and Sugarcandy.

They may not know where to turn, they have no advice and receive no help which will tell them if they are even looking in the right direction or not. You will even find them standing in one room far away from where they need to be, fixated on one item or one concept and trying to do everything they can to get it to work in an effort to compensate for this system.Solution:  Instead of using a system where you have only one hint, it would be best to throw in multiple hints, each one helping to guide the player towards the next direction. Think of it like the rings on a target, where each ring points to the same spot, but they each are further and further apart from each other.  An example would be a book that hints at a specific goal, for instance, find a way to stop a force field around a throne chair, and a hint at where to look, for example, that an old man has been spotted wandering around the grounds. When they are near the grounds, they will see hints at where the gardener is.  Rather than having each item in an event spontaneously pop up, event-style, to surprise players and send them off on a mission, it would be better if they were designed quest-style, maybe even in such a way that they can become a permanent fixture in the MUD once the event has finished, where anybody joining could follow the entire event from start to finish, without actually being able to accomplish the final objective.",]),(["size":787,"date":1220862859,"title":"event end","owner":"pyro","message":"If you want to see how the event ended, check /d/events/dragonaug2008/final_log_1 and final_log_2You'll notice a few bugs in there, like how yang somehow managed to sail across the ocean in 5 seconds, and how Geddoe got rewarded for placing the stones 8 times, yang got rewarded twice, tauran got rewarded once, and rohl got rewarded twice.

Because you're beginning to turn vampire you are partial to the light and it will do damage to you...This means you MUST put on the daywalker cloak to move through this area.  If you do not you will lose a enough HP to make it deadly (there will be something in the description that tells you basically this stuff).			a. You move through the area and come to a gate.  A few rooms in this area, It will tell you to \"break my jaw\" and \"insert fangs\".  You will not be allowed to go through the gate unless you have inserted your fangs. Once you do, you'll be in the Garden outside the layer/mansion.		4. Move through the maze of hedges and get to the door..it's that simple.			a. use the key you got from the \"slayer\" to get into the layer.		5. You're in the layer! Now just follow the last maze and find the Head Vampire!  When you find him, he gives a speech about ways of Vampires, but he is just a voice at this point...  At the end of his speech he reveals that he has been inside of you since you at the bat.. OMG he IS the bat!!  He command you to \"cut stomach\" so that he can be released from inside of 	you.			a. He takes his true form and asks you if you truely wish to become a vampire, if you say yes he will drink your blood then offer his blood.  If you say no (you're an idiot HA), no if you say no he will instantly kill you and you will lose everything you had on you.		6. Once you have been bitten and drank the blood of the Head Vampire, you return to the beginning with the \"Pale-skinned Man.\"			a. He will tell you that you must stay in the underground grave yard for a full 24 hours of unidle time (lasting through reboot and everything) there will be a start room..this will be where the class hall is (if that's cool).			b. Once you're 24 hours is up, you will be a Vampire and a global message announcing you're mortal death and your new immortal body and you will be informed that you're now a Vampire.  If you leave the room, it was for nothing and you are not a vampire and must start over a new character.***notes:  This MUST be done at night, and you MUST have an evil aura (which will be said in the first vision), as well as 90 in ALL stats, and you MUST be Demonic or Satanic, Perception MUST be MAXed.  You also MUST be outlawed (meaning PK someone in a law area) before going to Drac in the Eye of Hell (you're life is your final sacrifice).",]),(["size":875,"date":1222188658,"title":"race types","owner":"nulvect","message":"Centaur: fighterDwarf: fighter / magic (wis)Elf: magic / rogueFaerie: magic / rogueFerrel: rogueGiant: fighterGnoll: fighterGnome: magicGoblin: fighter / rogueGremlin: rogue / fighter / magic (wis)Half-elf: magic / rogueHalfling: rogueHuman: allIllithid: magicImp: magic / rogueMinotaur: fighterNetherman: fighterNymph: rogueOgre: fighterOrc: fighterRaknid: fighter / rogueSauran: fighterWeimic: fighter...and the quest races...Archangel: allDemon: fighter / rogueDragon: is its own classLich: magicVampire: is its own classAs you can see we have a large number of races suited mainly for fighter types.I'd like to avoid more races that are focused on str/con if we can, perhaps onewith good int/cha, medium dex/wis, and low str/con would help balance it out.edit: or very good con, good int and cha, so-so wis and str, and very low dex..",]),(["size":121,"date":1230521294,"title":"re: arena","owner":"nulvect","message":"I'm all for more arenas.

I was talking to him, and he said he can kill a 45k mob in 1 round, while it took around 30-40 rounds to kill a 117k mob in my area.  I did some testing, and it appears that at higher mob levels, mobs gain more stats than at lower levels.  A mob going from level 10 to 20 doesn't get nearly as much stronger as a mob going from level 100 to 110, or 140 to 150(shudder).  While these higher level mobs are designed for higher level players, they aren't really worth it except for gathering the items of said mobs.This leads me to 2 possible fixes:  1)  Change XP cuts so higher level players don't get the ability to kill those easier mobs anymore, which will either make players not go to higher levels or quit. 2)  Adjust the exp formula.  I like where Morcerf started, saying +1k exp for every level after 45, so level 70 would be worth 95k.  Maybe after level 75 mobs, you keep that 1k from 45 to 75, making a level 75 mob with 105k, and 1.5k from 75-100, 2k from 100-125, 2.5k from 125-150, etc.  I don't think it needs to go too much higher, as lv150 mobs are quite challenging to kill, but with the fact that a lv150 mob will do approx 1k dmg/round to a level 89 player, in addition to casting spells that would insta the player, it seems like it should be worth more than 6 rounds of killing 45k mobs.(especially with the fact that it would probably take over an hour to kill a 150k mob for any player in the game)",]),(["size":3914,"date":1261804910,"title":"player creation bug","owner":"stormbringer","message":"There is a bug when trying to creat a new character.

My main planconsists of it being a secluded academy-city for mages of the realm.Thus, the larger city-statewould be divided into four smaller cities,each controlled by a subclass of mage: psionic, pyromancer, necromancer,and wizard.  Thus, each of these cities would be thematic, with themajority of the monsters in the city being mages, but there wouldalso be thematically associated monsters, like undeads in the necromancer themed city, fire elementals, golems, etc.I would imagine putting this on a relatively remote island somewhere,and the history can help to explain the rest, but I would want it to kind of be a \"quest\" area to reach, in that one would have to solve some puzzles in order to get there, as these mages have secluded themselves for a reason.Each city would have it's own academy with some towers, dormitories,lecture halls, etc, as well as either a palace or whatever form ofgov't seems appropriate for each subclass.  The entire city willexist pretty independently of the rest of the world, being in itsown abyssal plane, so there will also be farms and forest, allmagically maintained so that the mages will have a place to live.History:Alytus was once a large island that hosted a huge academy for aspiring mages.  However, a long time ago, there was a fearsome attackby Iillthid on the academy, resulting in a war in which most of the magesdied before help could come from the mainlands, their minds consumed by theIllithid.  As a last resort, the four most powerful mages from each schoolof magic devised a spell to warp most of the entirety of the island outof existence, away from the reach of the illithid.  Thus now the islandis almost entirely secluded from the rest of the world, save for accessthrough the rip in reality that the mages used to move the world.  They did,however, safeguard that rip with puzzles and incantations such that noIllithid would ever be able to find the academy again.Since then, the city-state of Alytus has been divided into fourseparate towns and academies for each subclass of magic.  Since theutter isolation many years ago, the various schools of magic havedeveloped somewhat of a bitterness towards each other, but they dowork together in their entirely magic-based economy in order to surviveand hone their skills in magic.Feedback welcome.-Drack",]),(["size":58,"date":1270786956,"title":"on hold","owner":"drackmire","message":"area on hold pending discussion of changes to mage class.",]),(["size":453,"date":1271390534,"title":"shutdown daemon changes","owner":"nulvect","message":"I just made a change to the shutdown daemon, which is in/adm/daemon/shutdown_d.c - it will now splice together the rebootscreen bits with the credits so there is only one credits file.It is backed up as shutdown_d.nul, and the old reboot_screen file isin /doc/help/general/reboot_screen.old if it needs to be replaced.I put this here because I don't know if I'll be around at the nextreboot, so let's all pray to the binary gods that it works :P",]),(["size":1543,"date":1271465853,"title":"ideas","owner":"vian","message":"Angels and Demons, Dragons and LichPerhaps a good way to control the overabundance of Angels and Demons is to have a few rules that make it harder to be one.

I have an idea for an event where 1 lich and 1 dragon could be given out to players, as Arlon is released, and the new Quest Race laws can be implemented.Just a few ideas, any feedback let me know.

Black dragons might well be in league with liches and demons whilewhite and maybe blue would be more good. Reds are neutral and the greens I planto make would also be neutral.I've started planning a war daemon which could keep track of all this,but I'm not sure when I'll get it actually done.As for creating liches, they have not even been started. There's no way they'll be donebefore vampires and probably not before dragons are rebalanced either.We could begin on the planning stages for them, but honestly I'd rather put thateffort into vamps and dragons since there's much more done on them already.",]),(["size":249,"date":1271802519,"title":"needed","owner":"stormbringer","message":"We need a command that lists what commands you can use.

Names shall be of a fantasy nature to fit in with the mud's fantasy   setting. It is for the admins to decide if a name is not of a fantasy   nature. In most cases, use of actual words is not allowed. No phrases,   no proper names of places or people, no names from famous works, no use   of any race, class, or subclass in a name, and no misspellings of any   of these. Rulings on questionable names will be at staff discretion.   This rule was created Jan 17th, 2006, and pertains to all characters   created after that date. Suiciding and recreating *will* subject your   name to this rule.   Please see <help name policy> for more information.2. The Primal Darkness Staff is not allowed to help mortals in any way   unless it is to fix some kind of bug. Do not ask a staff member for   information that you know would be breaking the rules. Staff who break   this rule are subject to punishment just like anyone else.3. You may not harass anyone. Harassment is persistently targetting one   player or group of players in a negative way after being asked to stop.   Harassment is not tolerated on Primal Darkness.4. Spamming lines, says, tells, shouts, boards, or any other form of   communication is not allowed. Spamming is repeating something over   and over to annoy others. Spamming is harassment.5. Offensive material is not allowed in any public display. This includes   profane language, racial slurs, and discussion of lewd behavior, among   other things. It is ok in private communications as long as everyone   listening is ok with it. If someone asks you to stop using that language   to them or around them, please respect their wishes. If you repeatedly   ignore someone asking you to stop, it becomes harassment. Even if you think   something is not offensive, someone else may think it is. Public displays   include open lines, boards, says, finger info, titles, movement messages,   and basically anything any other player can see.6. Do not talk about other muds on open lines or boards. All too often, these   discussions lead to heated comparisons and slander. We want every player   to start with a blank slate upon entering Primal Darkness for the first   time, so we ask that you try not to judge people here based on their   actions on other muds. Do not bash any players or staff from other muds,   and do not target another player based on something that happened outside   of Primal Darkness.7. The auction line: Do not put worthless or very common items such as   stones, oil, or meat up for auction except in bulk in a container.   If your item doesn't sell, you must wait at least 10 minutes before   trying to auction it again.8. Using color or misleading information to hide your enter and exit   messages is not allowed. An exit message should have a perfectly   clear indication of which direction you leave in.9. It is illegal to give away any quest or deed information for any   reason. Quests may be done with other players, but all players must be   actively questing. You may not finish a quest, and another person just   solves the end of it.10. Scripting is not allowed. Scripting is having a program playing the    game for you. Triggers, macros, and other client-side conveniences are    ok as long as you are at the keyboard. If you are not at your keyboard,    your character must be idle. Using auto-login triggers is ok as long as    it successfully connects you and then leaves you idle. The staff does    not appreciate being spammed by failed connection messages, so please    make sure it works.11. The delivery system: Use of any form of movement that does not involve    you entering a command for each room that needs to be traversed is    illegal while doing deliveries. This includes speed walks, gate, and fly.12. Bugs will happen, but exploiting them is not allowed and is considered    cheating. If you find a bug, use the <bug> command to report it and do not    try to use the bug again. Do not spread knowledge of bugs to other players.    Examples of bugs:    gaining exp with little or no effort; advancing skills, stats, or levels    without effort or exp; mobs that don't fight back; buying an item at a    shop for 0 money; casting many spells in the same round; etc...13. Feeding is not allowed. This is when someone sits in a party and does    nothing to help, but gains exp only because someone else is earning it.    If your position in the party does not involve killing, you must be with    someone else in the party, not sitting in a safe room using long distance    spells. Getting around the restrictions on levels within a party is    considered a form of feeding, since the restrictions are in place to make    sure everybody is fairly equal in strength.14. Character sharing is not allowed. This is when a single character is played    by two or more people at different times.15. Multiplay is not allowed. This is when two or more characters which belong    to a single player interact in some way. This includes transfer of any    items or money, avenging the death of another of your characters, asking    someone to log on an alternate character to help you, or granting such a    request. Note that dropping items or money, suiciding, then creating a    new character and picking up the things you dropped is still multiplay.    Helping someone to transfer anything between their characters is as illegal    as doing it yourself. No player may have more than one of his characters    logged on at any given time, which includes link-dead characters. You must    completely log off all characters before logging in with a different one,    you cannot just go link-dead.    This rule extends to guilds as well: No guild can have any rules regarding    alternate characters for any reason.    Staff members may log on a test character for debugging purposes.16. LANs: If you wish to have multiple people play from the same LAN at once,    you must first contact an Admin and request to be allowed LAN access.    Players on a LAN may party together, but may not exchange any items or    money. Stealing from, looting, or killing players while on a LAN is    forbidden.17. Player killing is allowed on Primal Darkness. You must be level 20 before    you can PK or be PKed. You must wait 5 days between PKs of the same    character. The victim may seek revenge by PKing his killer back, but    must observe the 5 day waiting period after his revenge PK. During the    5 day waiting period, any purposeful attack against that victim is    considered illegal, regardless of whether it results in the victim's death.    If the victim attacks you and dies, it is his own fault, not yours.    If you belong to a guild, this rule applies to your entire guild rather    than just to you. Any attempt to get around this by inducting or removing    members will result in punishment for the entire guild. PK in a nopk zone    such as Tirun is also illegal and is considered bug abuse.    If you control or otherwise purposely manipulate a mob so that it kills    a player, including attacking someone who is already fighting a mob so    that the mob will land the last hit, you are still subject to this rule.    If you assist someone else to PK, you are still subject to this rule.    If a victim is killed by a mob while running away from a player or group    of players, everyone is still subject to this rule.    Killing of outlaws is *not* subject to this rule.    Unrestrained PK of many people in a short period of time is considered    a PK spree and is illegal. Additionally, multiple PK attempts against    the same target in a short period of time can be considered harassment,    though this is up to the discretion of the staff.18. Stealing kills is not allowed. If someone is killing a mob, you can't    join them, help them, take their kill while they rest one room away,    or loot the corpse when they are done unless you are partied together.    Be careful with any corpse-looting triggers!  Please remember that we are all here to have fun. Use common sense when  deciding anything. The staff will always do our best to enforce these rules  in a fair way, but we would much rather be improving the game than policing  the players and interpreting difficult situations!  Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse for breaking them.  Punishments will vary, but may range up to complete banishment and deletion  of all of the offending player's characters.  These rules are updated as needed. We will try to notify players of changes,  but we suggest reading the rules at least on a monthly basis.This is the newest rules draft I have made up. I think it's prettycomprehensive but if everyone could review it and make suggestions we canget this updated rules page in.",]),(["size":74,"date":1294645576,"title":"re: new rules draft","owner":"daos","message":"What parts have changed?

Where in the lawless zones if someone kept up being an outlaw that eventually whatever town they frequented the most would form a posse and try to string them up and kill them for their crimes. The player could attempt to run but once a posse was formed all towns would be on the alert and venders would not buy or sell from them and shout when they came near, drawing the posse in to find and string them up.I am not sure how well that could be implemeted or even if it is a good idea. Just my thoughts on he subject from the past. I will post more soon, as I think of things.

If there were more ranks for higher levels, or if the ranks were more spread out to go to higher levels, it might help.Also perhaps redoing certain unused spells/abilities to be higher level.

The room would checkthe info stored on the user to see if they completed the step beforethis room's step.3) When a given room's stage is done, this step gets stored on theuser and a randomized next step picked for that user.

All i'm adding is a mapping listingmapping multi_quest =([]);multi_quest[\"quest_name_here\"] =([\"last\":\"filename\",\"next\":\"filename\"]);ORmulti_quest[\"quest_name_here\"] =\"completed\";Rest will be the inherit for new quest rooms. It will handle updatingthe player's progress and tests. Reason for this is the mud's built_incleanup system would do away with dorment quest stages while saving theplayer's info.Ironman",]),(["size":1019,"date":1319657817,"title":"Re: multi_path quests","owner":"nulvect","message":"Ironman, the basics look good. Two small things:I don't think we should make a new inheritable room file. If we do, questswill not be centralized - they would be spread out all over and near impossibleto keep track of. It would be much better to just use a daemon to keep it allin one place.Instead of only storing the next and last steps of a quest in progress,maybe we should store every step completed so far. That would give more flexibilityin deciding the next step.Oh, and again, we shouldn't be storing a step as a filename - just store an intcode, and each quest can just define its own codes. That will allow for, again,more flexibility. Which is basically the whole point of this system.Looking good though, keep it up. I try to talk to you when I see you on, butyou usually log off within a minute or so. I don't just sit here and stare at ascreen all day, but I do check in, so if you talk to me on cre I will see it.Posting or mudmail is probably better for long term discussions though.",]),(["size":423,"date":1319663331,"title":"Re: Re: multi_path quests","owner":"ironman","message":"I usually check posts, mail and upload files.

In order to promote a little bit of growth  over the winter instead of the usual decline that we see, I'm going to  be holding an area contest.  This is a recruitment contest, in reality,  but the prizes are area based.  If you recruit a certain number of new  players who are fairly active and stay around, there will be a number of  prizes given for the next area I start.        PRIZES:     - The first [10] people to recruit [1] player will get           -A monster with an (appropriate) name of your choice.     - The first [5] people to recruit [2] players will get           -The ability to design a (balanced) weapon or piece            of armour that will be in the area.     - The first [2] people to recruit [3] players will get           -Early beta access to the area.  After it is ~80%            complete, you will get an undroppable/auctionable/            etc key that will bring you to the area.  There are            conditions with this one, you'll know if you get it.     - The first person to recruit [4] players will get           -To pick an (appropriate) name for the area.     - The first person to recruit [5] players will get           -To pick the theme of the area (general design: the            type of area, weather, where it is, the kind of mobs            there, etc.)     If anyone has any questions on this contest, feel free to mudmail me!  -Vian",]),(["size":36,"title":"Re: area contest?","date":1324054740,"owner":"nulvect","message":"Sounds good to me, Vian, go for it.",]),(["size":171,"title":"umm...","date":1324301789,"owner":"ironman","message":"you know you posted the server request on the idea board and not thetirun board stormy ??i'll see what i can do for part of it if funds permit. will know latetuesday.",]),(["size":216,"title":"sorry","date":1324404706,"owner":"stormbringer","message":"I thought I posted it to this bored.
