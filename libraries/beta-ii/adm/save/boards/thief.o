ICE! POISON! we flame up an arrow with a spark shoot em teh direction we want and make that target wish he never got hit by that arrow cuz now HES ROLLIN ON THE CARPET DYING from the blazzzing heat eh? a lil ice arrow to slow him down completely to a halt! wouldnt hurt now MWAHAHAH!!!whats next?you may ask of course?WE ROB EM!!while they are in that paralyzed state their pockets are wide open! and now the timers clickin cuz that ice and heat are now slowing to melt and a quick seal will be our get away :Dmaybe a quick chop chop to slice n dice the dude to let him deal with those DOTs that we have piled up in these arrows *cackles*throw me some cake for these ideas nul :)Sparticus <-- slave master",]),(["size":164,"title":"stealing in arena","date":1206425963,"owner":"nulvect","message":"For the moment, stealing is disabled in the arena.

I noticed agility is also not as expensive which is nice, perception is the only one I think would be that much cheaper for a thief compared to how much it costs right now.Also, a couple things for thieves.  Picking a mob gets 1k exp while a player gets a bunch more, maybe mobs should give a little more if stealing is supposed to be our main source of exp.  Also, only being able to pick from a player 3 times and then having it fail is a little silly, perhaps it should give a message like \"You can not pick from this player again so soon.\" instead of giving an outlaw strike.Then, I went outlaw from picking from an angel, but I'd be able to PK said angel with no problem.  That seems a bit silly as well, and I'm guessing the same applies to lawless areas, where you'd think it wouldn't apply.On the note of the outlaw thing, Stormy used to talk about revamping the jail system.  I wonder if this is up for thoughts?  My biggest problem is that after serving time, you still get punished for that offense again if you get another offense.  If I already served for these 2 stealing offenses, why should I steal for 3 when I only get one more?Thieves seem pretty neat though, thanks for listening to the input even though I'm the only one playing one hehe :)",]),(["size":395,"title":"re: cenn","date":1212038542,"owner":"nulvect","message":"If you keep sticking your hands in someone's pockets, he willeventually notice, no matter how skilled you are. The exp you getfrom a mob is not \"1k\" either. Stealing is probably going to beeasier on things smaller than you, but I thought that went without saying.As for jail, if you continue to mess up, you get harsher punishments,just like in real life.
