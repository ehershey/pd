The followingoutline hilights the modifications to the port.1) Builders can now work in teams if they so wish.2) Builders now control who has access to the files contained in their   directories and at what level of access.3) Builder areas are locked out from other builders. The owner of the   area may unlock them be granting access.4) There are several new commands that allow you to check info on the   objects.5) PARTY SYSTEM ---    A) Snooping another builder is allowed if and only if they are in       a party with you.    B) Calling another builder is allowed if and only if they are in       a party with you.    C) A builder may take someone on a walking tour of their area without       granting access if they party with the person.In general, you will find that you have been granted much more controlover your projects.

It will take dedication on the part of a coder, but the main problem is people have always seemed so closed-minded to guns on pd. PD is a fantasy land with wizards and dragons, pirates and ships etc etc. I dont think it would break any form of \"rp\" we have going on with pd.

I assume the general idea behind it was to slow down the exp rate anyways. Of course i've always been against that, but thats neither here nor there ;). Maybe the ointments could have some sort of passive, regenerative effect. I'm not sure exactly how you would balance it out,  but a right mix of not having to apply every single round with a healthy mix of still only being able to regenerate to fast. Maybe when you first apply it it takes like 4 rounds to start working but then regenerates a generous amount of sp over 6-8 rounds. No stacking of the command, so only one application between 10-12 rounds.hope that made sense :P***EDIT*** 'to fast' should be 'so fast'",]),(["size":700,"date":1196100541,"title":"randy","owner":"ironman","message":"I'm going to be working on a firearms system soon bro.
