Therefore the amount of abilities/dmg we can do is limited to the amound of Sp that we have. More Sp = More abils = more Dmg.Warriors are supposed to be the buff fighter, the fighter that knows all weapons, the fighter that deals the dmg(besides zerkers!), but that is hard when your most of your dmg is coming from your abils.We might get 6 a skill on every weapon, but that isnt enough, especially when your most likely only going to be using swords.Why go warrior, when you can go anti/pala and get the luxury of near infinate Sp, or go Zerker and not care about sp, yet deal the dmg. Warrior's need something that can put them on par with the rest of the fighter group, and what better way then by giving them the best idles in the game`, amount of idles and dmg`.You could go and make an ability that uses discipline, but that wouldnt be the best thing, as we would require Sp for it, and as ive said before, we are limited in the amount of times we can use it.So thats what i see in Discipline, more Idle attacks around. I realise the limit of 8 idles around would have to removed though.If that cant/wont be done, how about making discipline add dmg to our rounds?Lac wants to deal the damage, without eating the Spage.",]),(["size":629,"title":"new passive ability","date":1153111374,"owner":"nulvect","message":"So in the next couple days you guys will be gaining a new abilitywhich I don't want to go unnoticed.With enough double wielding skill, warriors will be able touse 1 less hand for multi-handed weapons. This means youcan wield 2 2-handed axes if you want. Doing this willincur a slight penalty on how good your weapon is...but I think you'll all find it useful, especially afterI make you some unique abilities which use differenttypes of weapons together.That's right, I finally came up with a different conceptfor warriors.

Entangle and gash willbe going away, and a single ability will replace them which will let you mixand match the attacks from the [weapon] section. So instead of gash,you'd do <combine slash stab> for example. (combine is not a finalized name).And doing it in reverse order, <combine stab slash>, will be different.There will be some more weapons-based defense abilities as well, and I planto make parry useful.
