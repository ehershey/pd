I need the info. I talk take anymore of this instant on the spot change that stuffs me overI want to know that my cure does 78hp and not 180 anymore, and i wanted also to know that cure didn't heal body damage, If i had known, i would not have died from body damage that day.

Cure was changed because of bugs that allowed clerics to cure more than was ever intended. The reason your cure dropped so much was a typo in the code, it has now been fixed. your cure should do around 125-130 per use. Sorry for the oversite, it was late when I was fixing the bugs in it. As fr the body damage thing, I have no idea why it wasn't fixing body damage, I had to rewrite the entire spell and I hope that now it does help with body damage, but that only works when you cure me all or cure me limb.","size":523,]),(["title":"cure","owner":"stormbringer","date":1029352724,"message":"I have changed cure again, the cap was 600 and is now 800 and a level 20 spell. Cure is dependant on your skill in healing, your level and part of your faith. For a plain cure, your hp gets pumped to your full healing amount, for cure all you get half the hp of your healing amount and half healing applied to all limbs, for cure limb, you get 1/3 your healing amount for hp and full healing amount done on the limb named. This is the final rebalance of cure for awhile.

I am not playing this character anymore, Why bother if i can play a red and be way better, My skills cost too much and i get very little worthwhile advantages to being blue. Yeah i shouldn't bi@tch so much, But i still might come on to talk but untill the dragons have been balanced i will just chill doing RL stuff","size":383,]),(["title":"Blue","owner":"valko","date":1034484457,"message":"We, as a rare specimen of dragons, should be superior to the other dragons. Firstly, the red's flameclaw should not outclass us by so much. I know our magic makes up for it, but really, who needs it when you have oils. Secondly, ice breath should freeze everyround and instead of getting hp from it (which we can simply cure ourselves or apply oil), the dmg should be upgraded. Furthermore, our armour should be better then the rest of the dragons, as we have more fats and flubber. So, how protection should be more substantially. Finally, our claw should not be just a normal claw, we should have some claw that deals elemental dmg or anything, as long as we can match the red dragons. There are too many red dragons around! Dont downgrade the reds, but instead upgrade the blues! Dragon is the most SUPERIOR race. ","size":818,]),(["title":"me","owner":"wildfire","date":1035931936,"message":"i am blue, i made it, im happy. blue is my favorite color","size":58,]),(["title":"bah..","owner":"wildfire","date":1044070616,"message":"ok, blue dragons like..
