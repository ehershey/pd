I want to know what you guys think :)\"Do we have to get rid of Luke?\" came a small, shakey voice from my bedroom door. I turned to see my brother, age 10, standing there looking at me as if I could save his best friend from the fate the electric company had given him. \"I don't know, hon\" was all I could respond. How can I, a senior in highschool, my little brother's number one tormentor/protector, be able to tell him that the descision to keep Luke, our one of a kind shepeard mix (you know the kind--you go to the pound and it's love at first site), would cost us our home owner's insurance. It was crushing me inside, I had spent the hours and the time, not to mention the hot-dogs (don't tell my parents) training this dog, teaching him to sit, stay, go to his pen, you know, all those cute little tricks we kids find absolutely amazing. Now, all that was going to be taken away from both myself, and my little brother. Know why? Well, let me tell you. SCE&G has a contract with a meter reading company, and these meter readers (I suppose that's what I'll call them) are the ones that go around to our houses and read the meters. Well SCE&G has been told and, to my knowledge, has in their files, that we own a dog that could have the potential be aggressive. (I would hope that a shepeard mix WOULD have the potential to be aggressive, especially if someone with a negative intent were to be sneaking around my parents bedroom window at a late hour) However, this must have not been fully understood by the meter reading company, even though their meters warned that there was a very mean dog in the backyard (the meter said it!). Well, of course some of you are guessing what happens next. The meter man comes to our house, my mother was home, doesn't ring the doorbell, or ask her to put the dog up, he just walks into MY backyard like it's his own. My mother comes out to see who's here to find this stranger in our backyard. It's ok though, the next meter man explained to my father later, that he didn't need someone to go with him to the backyard, he could just smack the dog in the head with the meter. (This explains the random cuts my dog had been recieving lately) Our dog saw my mother, and for what I now believe were protection purposes, bit the meter man. (Oh, by the way, the dog bit the arm with the meter and then proceeded to try to rip it apart, he let go of the meter man) The ambulence arrives, our dear meter man gets stitches, and my insurance company is forced to settle with him to the tune of 5,000 dollars. I'm sure you know the rest of the story, we get a letter, \"lose the dog or lose the insurance,\" and now we're stuck with no insurance and the world's most beautiful, hot-dog-eating, guard dog, who is now stuck under lock and chain in a small kennel. Why is it that SCE&G and their contracted companies are allowed to take my family's happiness? our security? and my little brother's childhood? Ask yourself this, \"How would I tell my son/daughter that their best friend in the whole world is now considered a dangerous animal?\" You couldn't do it, could you? We find ourselves thinking up little lies to tell them. Things like, \"We had to give Luke away\" and \"Luke is happy now.\" We've fought this battle, and we've lost. Our meter man claims that we are at fault because we didn't post that we had a dog. Maybe he should have checked his meter a bit closer. They say it wasn't in writing. Well why is it on your computer file? It's just a dog to them. It's a friend to me, my little brother, and my family. I'd like to see one of SCE&G's CEO's having to watch their father lose sleep at night trying to figure out a way to save his children's beloved pet. I don't think he'd like that very much, do you? Oh, and if you still think he's dangerous. The meter company didn't seem to get that idea. The very next day there was a meter man in my backyard AGAIN. And he wasn't even told the other man had been bitten. Besides, he has his trusty meter to hit my dog with right? Guess it goes to show, incompetency does pay off. To be fully honest, I'm proud of Luke. I hope the next time a stranger walks into my yard with a potentially dangerous weapon, and one of my family members is playing there, that man will get the same reception the meter man got. My dog didn't do anything wrong. He did what he was supposed to do. He protected my mother from a man he knew from past experience had no recourse of using his meter to inflict pain. This man came barging into my dog's protected territory and this is what happened. Maybe SCE&G should get a contract with a company that knows it's impolite to barge into someone else's property and hit their dog when he comes to find out who you are. I know it would save my family the tough choice we are now facing, put our more fuzzy family member to sleep, or live in a home without insurance. feel free to send some responce to me.. hopefully my story will get picked up and i can save my puppy :)Sugar",]),(["size":154,"title":"Warning","date":1044319990,"owner":"sugarcandy","message":"Just a warning..
