I know that is alot to lower players, but it is nice to have an even balance, and you guys should keep your money :)Remember:=========If you want something for or from the guild, just say so. There is usually alot of money in the treasury so we can always afford to get something.You can get private rooms in the tower, they can include anything that the admins let through balance so what you want you got.

But with only one set-back.Where will the entrance be if the guild is sailing, or will it still be the archways in Tirun and Helgrath?Secondly, i dont think there are enough illuminati members on at anyone time to keep the guild from being sunk by those in rival guilds, making it impossible for those who need guild services before reboot if sunk.-Crem-",]),(["size":572,"title":"honestly","date":1050126170,"owner":"aziraphale","message":"The limits on guild eq are just a tad low I think. It takes just a few hours to get to 15, and then you can jsut go and kill a mob in lodos for a broadsword, which is better than our holy sword, which has been set to the highest WC allowed to us.Seriously, weapons have their automatic wc requirements, so why not raise the limit a bit? No one of too low a level can use it, so how is it unbalanced? People in this giuld can jsut go and get starscreams and dragon slayers whenever they want and give them to guild members.And what is the limit on armour going to be?",]),(["size":1167,"title":"Guild Shake Up","date":1051759316,"owner":"ug","message":"Welcome Illuminati membersToday is the day of great change, the Illuminati is now becomeing more then what it was. Hopefully these changes will allow us to grow and prosper as never beforeAs a newly appointed leader of this noble guild, new rules are being created, these rules were all decided upon by the leaders council. The new rules are as follows:All new members must have a description, this description must contain themes of justice, repentace or both.New members must be sponsored by either both anari, both leaders, or one of each.To attain hero status you must achieve level 50If you wish to become an anari you must post your reasons on this board, and have sponsorship from at least 4 herosThis guild's ideals are that of justice and repentace.

Besides the point of xp cuts, it's stupid. You can be a really active, avid member of the guild that does alot and don't have to be level 50. I hate level based promotion, it's stupid and narrow-minded. I think promotion should be based more on activity, what you do for the guild, loyalty and how long you've been around. But what does that matter when you can power to 50 in a few days? I'm not saying I want to be promoted, I don't particularly deserve it yet but I just don't like the system.Gonzales.",]),(["size":241,"title":"level","date":1051843061,"owner":"ug","message":"Level 50 is one of the requirements to be called a hero in the guild, it is not the only onejust because you are powerful is no reason to be callled a heroyou need to do someting worthwilde aswell(pls excuse and errors using telnet atm)",]),(["size":381,"title":"Garet","date":1051892852,"owner":"gonzales","message":"I killed Garet today in the name of justice. When I was level 12 he tried to kill me with a summoned assassin, which if not illegal, is definitely unethical. My Warblade's spilt his blood in retribution.

What constitutes repentance?If it is simply an apology, what may stop them from repeat offending?If it is some form of cost offered up to the guild, how much should be required, should it be set (and maybe increased for repeat offenders) or worked out based on what the offender can pay (eg, 10k gold is alot more to a level 15 than it is to a level 50)?",]),(["size":138,"title":"apology","date":1052909102,"owner":"ug","message":"If an apology is given, then it must be accepted, the first time.If they EVER repeat offend...
