U still could use normal abils, but just the moves for fighters i think should be melee. Mages should get some funky spells, rogues should get more decietful abilities, and wanderers are kinda hard, maybe some dances/charm songs or something.All this really will need a lot of thought to come up with the abils ect, especially how angels would have to have something similar.maybe some minor skill bonuses aswellfighter: +0.5 attack per lvl, +0.5 melee per lvl, +0.5 defense per lvlwanderer: +0.75 euphony per lvl, +0.75 entertainment per lvlmage: +0.75 Magic attack, +0.75 Magic defenserogue: +0.5 murder per lvl, +0.5 attack, +0.5 agility per lvlclergy: +0.5 faith per lvl, +0.5 magic attack per lvl, +0.5 melee per lvlif i come up with any ideas i'll post.","owner":"aldur","size":1481,]),(["title":"no","date":1037558227,"message":"I am not going to do changes like this.

They are very underpowered. Gore is like a weak rush, massacre is just slow and annoying. I'm thinking something to help all the evil classes, kataan, antipaladin, assassin.. kataan don't have it to badly in the fact they can massacre and vortex/demonfire/hellfire in the same rounds.. so i guess massacre is ok, but gore.. well its useless for everyone, so i'm thinking have it upgraded a bit.. like make it like swipe was... like double attack+lvl, then i guess against players half that.. i don't know what the coding was for swipe but it worked well, it prolly shouldn't have been as good for weimics but for dragons.. it was very good.when i say half that, thats just the PvP reduction.um for assassins, i don't know what they need since i really haven't played one... but keep massacre for the kataans, upgrade gore for us fighters.Terror: a paralyzing ability where the demon scares the foe using our charisma vs. opponents wisdom. can be used during battle. rounds of paralyze = (demons charisma + level vs wisdom) then divide it by 10.terror could also be used on whole rooms for a 2 round para max.Assault: A Voilent attack unleashed by a demon to start combat, the demon uses the super-natural speed to catch the opponent off guard and deliever several devastating blows.Number of hits = lvl/10dmg per hit = 2*str + (attack/5)Sp cost: 50 sp per hitlGore: sp cost: 3*levelDamage: 2*str + attack + level + dexterity - defense/5 so for me to me that'd do..615 dmg to a mob, and 307 to a player, its a tad bit better then slash, as it should be.please look at these carfully we need some sort of upgrade.thanks.","owner":"aldur","size":2017,]),(["title":"masscre","date":1043353007,"message":"Masscre has been changed so it can no longer be used in the same round as other abils","owner":"stormbringer","size":86,]),(["title":"planned changes","date":1043361948,"message":"I want to discuss some changes I am planning to demons. The racial abils such as massacre will be changed to an added abil instead of a standard abil. this would mean massacre would have a damage cap of around 300, take 2 rounds to hit and be combinable with other spells/abils. a basic example: You cast massacre, in the same round you slash/cut/whatever. the slash/cut hits, start of the next round massacre hit and you are able to slash/cut during the round masscre hits. Basically this would mean massacre adds upto 300 extra damage ever other round. I would also make the same changes for angels.
