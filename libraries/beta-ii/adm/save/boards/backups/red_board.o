Melee damageAs a dragon, especially a red fighter dragon, the damage we do is considerably less compared to that of  fighters, for example, because of the fact that weapons do a whole lot more than melee. Flying drop kick also doesn't paralyze-the monsters stand up straight away.  This makes it almost impossible to exp faster than a fighter with 3/4 of your stats. I know comparing everything to the fighter class is kind of wrong, since we are not fighters, but we are red dragons and since we have no magic abilities, we should excel in combat.2. Area abilitySomething dragons really lack is an area affecting ability or more realistically, an ability that would affect all people/monsters that you are in combat with. There were some ideas of breathe being such an ability a while back but nothing seems to have been done much. If an ability were to be implemented, the damage it should do should be between a 2-hit to 3-hit flameclaw. This would give us a variety in choosing a different attack for a different situation. This is what I believe is the most needed change to red dragons.P.S. Why is it that all the other dragons have flameclaw as well. We are a completely different race of dragons to the other ones in that we cant use magic, so how come we dont have any unique abilities.",]),(["size":122,"owner":"wisp","title":"yep","date":1044792294,"message":"We've always needed 50mp to cast breathe, that why i consider mp to be mental points and not magic points.*shrugs*Wisp",]),})
