This is a rare treat for role players.  In addition,in some cases where a player is faced with a lot of counts they feel they didn't deserve, they can have a court battlewith the person who feels they should die for their crimes, the judge being an NPC controlled by a random staff memberwho wishes to resolve the matter.On the down side, in a role playing situation you can't reallysend messages instantly across the world.  This would mean nolines of any kind, no tells and acting in character completelyunless you were posting on the message board.  A RP characterwould be deleted for breaking any rule without a 'warning',unless the situation was proven to be some sort of misunderstanding.Strict interaction rules between RP characters and normal players would need to be made.  This idea basically separatespeople who want to see PD grow as a story and world from thosewho want to PvP (player vs player) and chat.Potential RP finger info:(A RP character's info would be disguised somewhat, since theymight wish for their character to be revealed through RPing)                             %^RED%^ /\\			     %^RED%^/  \\                            %^RED%^/  %^YELLOW%^* %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                           %^RED%^/      \\                          %^RED%^/ %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Primal %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                         %^RED%^/ %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Darkness %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                        %^RED%^/            \\                       %^RED%^/              \\                      %^RED%^/ %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^(%^RED%^player info%^CYAN%^)  %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                     %^RED%^/   %^FLASH%^ROLE PLAYER    \\                    %^RED%^/                    \\                   %^RED%^/                      \\                  %^RED%^/    %^BOLD%^CHARACTER NAME      %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                 %^RED%^/   %^RESET%^[%^B_WHITE%^%^BLACK%^Test            %^RESET%^]     %^RED%^\\                %^RED%^/                            \\               %^RED%^/                              \\               %^RED%^/                                \\             %^RED%^/%^YELLOW%^*%^RED%^        %^BOLD%^AGE %^RESET%^[%^B_WHITE%^        %^RESET%^]          %^YELLOW%^*%^RESET%^%^RED%^\\              %^RED%^==================================              Levi",]),(["date":1024379163,"title":"IPs","owner":"wraith","size":214,"message":"These are 2 different IPs from the same character who claims they are connecting from the same place/computer/ and provider as they were earlier. 172.195.218.85    172.193.230.128        let me know what you think",]),(["date":1024405522,"title":"looks like...","owner":"stormbringer","size":30,"message":"Both of them look like aol./",]),(["date":1024531238,"title":"Clearmoon","owner":"wraith","size":1045,"message":"Well, he was on here with an alt, being very loud and annoying about the dragon quest, then I see him on builders making as ass of himself:Active <driver> Clearmoon: exp:10117373Clearmoon has rejoined our reality.Clearmoon licks you.Clearmoon frowns in intense concentration.Clearmoon looks you over.Clearmoon says: the question isClearmoon says: what am i:)Clearmoon says: male, femaleClearmoon says: old, youngClearmoon says: not even I know ;)Clearmoon gazes at the sky with wide, innocent eyes dragon.Clearmoon winks with a sparkle.Clearmoon looks over the dragon.Clearmoon disintegrates a fountainClearmoon says: i hate that dragonClearmoon looks over the dragon.Clearmoon says: ahhClearmoon says: its still hereAutosaving.Clearmoon tells you: spppppyingClearmoon says: spyingClearmoon exclaims: SPPPPYYYYIIINGG!Clearmoon looks you over.Clearmoon is gone from our reality.Exit <driver> Clearmoon: exp:10117373I vote that any person on builders who plays a player here CANNOT do any of the special race quests.",]),(["date":1024532874,"title":"velkyn","owner":"wraith","size":580,"message":"He was arrested for inviting mocha and hermes to go dragon questing with him:hp: 210|sp: 111|mp: 355 >  %say both of u start new alts%You say: both of u start new alts%hp: 210|sp: 111|mp: 355 >  %say ill invite u to the party%You say: ill invite u to the party%hp: 210|sp: 111|mp: 355 >  %say ok%You say: ok%hp: 210|sp: 111|mp: 355 >  %%Mochaprincess says: k%Hermes nods solemnly.%Hermes dismounts A brown horse (ridden by Hermes).Inactive <driver> Hermes: exp:22739%Hermes suddenly disappears into a sea of irreality.%say no class i think%You say: no class i think",]),(["date":1024533224,"title":"Velkyn 2","owner":"wraith","size":232,"message":"I have a strong suspicion that he, crystal and velkin are cenn.
