As once you get higher it takes longer to kill mobs..A lvl 37 sorc could easily kill as fast as me, yet im 30 or so lvls higher, more skills, better stats and get a xp cut for them. This is because i take one on at a time, while they will take all of them on.So i think, that Whirl should be made a lvl 35-40 ability, that hits everything your incombat with in the room. As no one uses whirl now, its usleless when you get it and still is..Ofc it wouldnt do mass dmg, because we are fighters and not a 'room affect' class.My room affect move is 'kill all' atm, and that wont work to well when pk comes in..alotta mistake deaths.Centaur Fighter, 6 charging a lvl or 5.5 at least.Zerkers, warriors and rangers will go to -sp alot of the time when they use slash, and will have to spend 2-4 rounds applying oil/ointment to get their sp back, while paladins and antis will just boost. Yes i know thats it is thier 'special ability'.So i was thinking that the non boosting subs could get a spell called 'Restoration' or something. It would turn their Mp in to Sp. It couldnt be casted in combat, and when you do it, you are parrared for the round you do it.It would mean that fighters had to improve their int and wis to use it, which will get players to spend time on their stats instead of powering..Would be based of Wis, your lvl and maybe a skill, called..wait for it, 'restoration' or 'recovery' ?for the subs:Paladin is fine, just need Smite put in.Anti, fine aswell.Zerker, dunno, never plaeyed them, but im guessing they are fine, considering hw many have made it to elite :pWarrior: not being biased, but the warrior only abilities kinda suck :pThats all from me, hoe it helps you..Ranger: Like warrior, abils suck.",]),(["size":2063,"date":1042886710,"owner":"haraldhardraade","title":"My post","message":"ok i have played many fighters and gotten a few to elite so i know my fair share. im just gonna lay it for each subclass and you tjae what you want.Paladin - they are pretty much fine as they are except there spells are alittle useless maybe taking away cripple and dispell and giving them another support spell, maybe a regen spell or something.godspeed harAnti-Paladin - Anti's dont get cure but they get bloodlust which is good. Anti's are pretty much complete aswell but they either need a \"unique\" move or a haste spell and i think that Anti's would be rock solid.Warrior - warriors are good on paper not so good when it comes into play. They get 6 on all weapon skills which is good so they can use any weapon like the best. But the warrior unique moves such as Whip, Impale, Entangle need to be looked at and improved. Hack is just a copy over of slash maybe it could be changed to act alittle different? im not sure.Ranger - Rangers are good they have so many different abils and stuff. I think Silent step and Camouflage when they are added should round of rangers for now.Zerker - Berserkers are good, rage is powerful but headbutt and the other melee moves do barely any damage and when they have no choice in what moves they do it kind of makes rage half worth it and half why dont i just slash. I think rage needs some work maybe the moves like cleave and fear they you do in rage can do somemore damage to make Zerkers a better class.As for restoration whats the difference between boost and restoration? takes mp gives sp. Maybe the fighters kneel down and are para'd for 3 rounds at the end of the 3 rounds they have full sp and 1/2 mp. 1/2 mp so they can do it twice. I think that would be more fair for the other classes. im not sure your going to have to decide what is fair.As for fighters room affect if we got one it would have to be fairly weak otherwise we will be alittle to powerful and wouldnt be fair on the other classes.
