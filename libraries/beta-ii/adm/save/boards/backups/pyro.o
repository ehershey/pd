The reason for this is the quality of spells we get. For example, the best spell for exp we gain (lvl 8-36) is now 'scorch'(lvl8). Which deals more damage than inferno(lvl25) even when main skills were maxed at lvl 27 (Tested). This is a major downfall for pyros. Compared to classes such as Rogues, Fighter and Clergy, our attacks are a total joke. 2 characters of the same lvl, stats and skill but of difference class (eg. Pyromancer and Warrior) will experience dramatic difference in exping rates. A warrior will make 2x the amount of exp of the pyromancer using it's normal hits and buffed rush and slash. While the pyromancer is still killing with a weak spell such as scorch. I was very excited when i finally lvled up to get inferno and firebomb, only to find that it was 2 useless spells. Which made me stick with the spell i had been using from lvl 8-27. This definitely pisses fellow pyros off. Overall, after the downgrade and balancing, pyromancers are a subclass belonging to the poor exping rates of wanderers.I have a few basic ideas in improving the state that pyromancers are right now. These include changes in a few of our main spells.Firebomb In my opinion this should be the MAIN exping attack of pyros. Currently it is one of the worst spells to have in Primal Darkness after the downgrade. The reason for this is 1. It costs you tonnes of money! (Think about 50hp for 50 gold)2. It barely deals any damage until lvl 50 (which u'll need to use scorch to get to)3. Compared to other area attack spells available on Primal Darkness this is spell so $#@% that it's not even funny anymore. For example spells such as icestorm, vortex and holyfire all deals much more dmg (at least 5 times more damage). I suggest in upgrading this spell, think about it, it costs money and deals 5 times less than some little druid spell.Inferno/ Sear Needs to be buffed up more considering the hardships mages have to be put up with to get to this lvl and gain this spell. Fighters/ Rogue have it easy and they gain in damage each lvl, while Mages have to rely on new spells.That's about all for now, I seriously find it hard exping with a pyro. The experience i'm getting is nothing compared to my fighter/rogue characters of the same lvl. (Infact 1/3 of them)Please consider upgrading our spells.
