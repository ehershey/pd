The rain did not noticably dampen the Harvest Festival celebration, since most of therevelers were too drunk to even notice the weather.	Relain was not drunk. He was working, and he had nothing but contempt for men whodrank on the job. Relain was a non-descript sort of fellow in plain black clothing. He wore his hairin a shagged mess atop his head and he had large, powerfull hands. He went through the crowd ofrevelers unobtrusivly, moving toward the wealthier quarter of the city.	relain and his wife had argued that morning, and that always put him in a bad humor. Hiswife really had little cause for complaint, he thought, stepping aside for a group of drunken youngearistocrates. He was a good provider, after all, and their neat little cottage on the outskirts of town wasthe envy of all their friends. Their son was apprenticed to a local carpenter, and thier daughter hadexcellent prospects for a good marriage. Relain loved his wife, but she periodically becamewaspish over some little thing and pestered him to death about it. This time she was upset becausetheir cottage had no proper lock on the front door, and no matter how many times he told her thatthey, of all people, had no need of locks, she had continued to harp on the subject. Relain stoppedand drew back into a recessed doorway as the watch stomped by. Rejik would normally have bribbedthe watch to stay out of Relain's way, but it was Harvest Festival time, so there would be plenty ofconfusion to cover any incidental outcries. Rejik was not one to spend money needlessly. It was acommon joke in the seedier taverns that Rejik had deliberatly grown his vast beard so that he couldsave on the price of a cloak.	Relain saw the house that was his destination and went into the foul-smelling alley behindit. He had arranged for a ladder to be placed against the back of the house, and he climbed up quicklyand entered through a second-story window. He walked down the hallway and through a door at theend into a bedroom. A former servant of the house had drawn a diagram and had pointed out theroom of the owner of the house, a minor nobleman named Count Talen. Once inside the room,Relain laid down on the bed. As long as he had to wait, he might as well be comfortable. He couldhear the sound of revelry coming from downstairs.	As he lay there, he decided to install the lock his wife wanted. It wouldn't be expensive, andthe peace and quiet around the house would be more then worth it.	It was no more then half an hour later when he heard a heavy, slightly unsteady footfall on thestairs. He rolled quickly off the bed, crossed silently to the door, and put his ear up to the pannel. \"It'sno trouble at all.\" A slurred voice outside said. \"I've got a copy in my bedroom.\"	\"Really, Count Talen.\" A lady's voice called from below, \"I'll take your word for it.\"	\"No, Baroness, I want you to read his Majesty's exact words. It's the most idiotic proclamationyou've ever seen.\" The door opened, and a man carrying a candle entered. It was the man who hadbeen pointed out to Relain two days ago. Relain Idly wondered what the poor Count had done toirritate Mochaprincess enough to justify the expense of a professional visit by him. He brushed the thought aside. That was really none of his business.	Relain was a thorough professional, so he had several techniques available to him. Thefact that Count Talen's back was to him presented the opportunity for his favorite, however. He drew along gleaming dagger from his belt, stepping up behind the Count, and drove the long, slim blade intothe base of the Count's skull with a steely crunch. He caught the collapsing body and quietly lowered it to the floor. A knife-thrust in the brain was always certain, and it was quick, quiet, and produced aminimum of mess. Relain's wife absolutly hated  to wash her husband's work clothes when therewas blood all over them. Relain set his foot between the Count's shoulders and wrenched hisdagger out of the back of the skull. That was sometimes tricky. Pulling a knife out of bone takes quitea bit of strength. Relain rolled the body over and looked intently into the dead face. A professionalalways makes sure that a client has been permanetly seviced. The Count was definatly dead. His eyes were blank, his face was turning blue, and a trickle of blood was coming out his nose. Relainwiped off his dagger, put it away, and went back out into the hallway. He walked quietly back to thewindow through which he had entered.	There were two more names on the list Khale had given him, and with luck he could serviceanother this very night. It was raining, however, and Relain really disliked working in the rain. Hedecided to go home early instead and tell his wife he would give in just this once and install the lockshe wanted so much. Then he thought it might be nice if they took their son and thier daughter to thetavern at the end of the street to have a few tankards of ale with their neighbors. It was the HarvestFestival, after all, and a man should really try to spend the holidays with his friends and family.",]),(["date":1028129899,"size":2670,"owner":"khale","title":"Scorpio's Second: Aximili","message":"Hope you like it Ax. I was up all night                   ~\"You're really more trouble than your worth, you know,\" Aximili said to the dead mansprawled in the bow of the rowboat. Aximili always talked to the men he had killed. Many of Aximili'scolleagues believed that he was crazy. They were probably right.	Aximili's major problem lay in the fact that he always did things exactly the same way. Heinvariably stuck his knife into someone between the third and fourth ribs at a slightly downward angle.It was effective, though, since a knife thrust there absolutely cannot miss the heart. Aximili alsonever left a body lying where it fell. He had a compulsive sense of neatness that drove him to put theremains somewhere out of sight. Since Aximili lived and worked in the PD town of Tirun on thecoast of the sea, disposal was a simple matter. A short trip in a rowboat and a few rocks tiedto the deseased's ankles removed all traces. Aximili's habit-driven personality, however, led him toalways sink the bodies in the exact same place. The other Scorpio of PD  made frequent laughingrefrenses to 'Aximili's Reef', a place on the lake bottom suposedly piled high with sunken bodies.Even people who didnt fully understand the significance of the phrase referred to Aximili's Reef.	\"You went and did it didn't you?\" Aximili said to the corpse in the bow of the boat as herowed out to the reef. \"You just had to go and offend Mochaprincess. You've got nobody to blame but yourself for this, you know. If you'd behaved youself, none of this would have happened.\"	The corpse did not answer. They almost never did. Aximili stopped rowing and took his bearings. There was the usual light in the window of the Tavern on the far shore, and there was the warning fire on the rocky headlands on the nearside. The lantern on the wharf protruding out from Tirun was dead astern. \"This is the place,\" Aximili told the dead man. \"You'll have lots of company down there, so it won't be so bad.\" He shipped his oars and crawled forward. He checked the knots on the rope that held the large rock in place between the dead man's ankles. \"I'm really sorry about this, you know,\" he appologized, \"but it is your own fault.\" He lifted the rock - and the dead man's legs - over the side. He held the shoulders for a monet. \"Do you have anything you'd like to say?\" he asked. He waited for a decent interval, but the dead man did not reply. \"I didnt really think you would.\" Aximili said. He let go of the the shoulders, and the body slithered limply over the side and disappeared into the dark waters of the lake. Aximili whistled his favorite tune as he rowed back to shore.~",]),(["date":1028130010,"size":2663,"owner":"khale","title":"Scorpio's Third: Khale","message":"This was too easy. Hope Cenn finds his way back and reads this. *Cackles demonically*                                 ~Cenn was a small, weedy sort of fellow with thinning black hair and a lumpy skull. It sat atop his head like an uncharted jungle, left to grow on its own. His face was unshaven and a beard had begun to grow as he failed to make time from his job to shave. He did not so much walk as he didscurry through the crowded streets of Lodos in Western PD. In the daytime, Cenn was aminor official in the customshouse, biting his tongue as he took orders from his Elven superiors.Cenn loathed Elves, and being placed in a subservient position to them sometimes madehim physically ill. It was that loathing which had primarily been behind his decision to sell informationto the Palace Guard, to whom a mutual acquiantence had introduced him. When the Guard, after a few carefully worded questions, had slyly hinted that certain kinds of information mightbe worth quite a bit of money, Cenn had lept at the chance to betray his despised Superiors and to make a tidy sum as well. 	The information he had for  the Guard tonight was very important. The dirty Elves had sent a copy of the interior plans to the Scorpio Fortress through customes this morning, and Cenn had managed to steal it and smuggle it out of the warehouse without much trouble. The Guard should pay handsomely for this peice of information.	Cenn licked his lips as he rushed through the noisy crowds celebrating the HarvestFestival. There was an eight-year-old Raknid girl available at one of the slave marts, a ravishing childwith huge, terrified eyes, and if the Guard could be persuaded to be generous, Cenn might evenbe able to buy her. He had never owned a child before, the thought of having someone else to do his cleaning and laundry made him shiver with glee.	His mind was full of her as he passed a reeking allyway, and so he was not really paying anyattention - until he felt the strand of a wire snap tight around his neck.	He struggled of course, but it was not really much use. The assassin dragged him back intothe ally and methodically strangled him to death. His last thought was of the little girl's face. Sheactually seemd to be laughing at him. The hooded assaassin searched Cenn all over and tookthe folded peice of paper that read 'Scorpio Fortress Plans'. The Figure laughed as he opened the paper to find his grocery list inside. The hooded figure removed his hood and walked out into the street. \"Evenin' Khale.\" One of the beggars said, as the figure dropped a handfull of coins into his cup, holding his finger to his lips and saying \"Shhh.\"~",]),(["date":1028130106,"size":144,"owner":"khale","title":"Scorpio's Regent Mocha.","message":"Oky, so hours on end into the dark of night..of course im not gonna have them all done.

He conqueredevery land he came to, and had great confindence in him self that hewould for sure conquer this measly land. But little did he know that there were creatures in this land far stronger than he was. TheScorpian King wandered the land for nearly a month before finding any sign of life. When he did he came apon Rejik a measly peddler conning his way through life. As he came apon him he struck a deal with him. He told the peddler that if he would find him followers thathe would give him great powers. But Rejik did not know that The Scorpian King would not give him powers, but kill the peddler eitherway. A few days later the peddler returned to the king with news ofa young faerie whom was in the Forsaken, but Rejik knew that the faeriewas not wanting to stay with them. Rejik had told the faerie that she should see the king for he possessed great powers and would gladly help the young faerie with her troubles. She gladly argreed with Rejik,and met with the king the very next day. The king told her thatthis land was draining him of his powers and that he would like someoneto possess his essence for him so that he might live on. The young faerie was very unsure about what to think about his offer. The king then made the faerie an offer that she just did not want to give up. The king had told her that he was planning of making a guild beforehe would give his essence to the young faerie. She just could notrefuse his offer and gladly accepted. She said her good byes and lefther place in the Forsaken. The king told the peddler to round up someworkers and make him an underground lare which her would use for hisguild. The peddler then made it for him. Upon comletion the kingcalled for the faerie to return to him. He then made the faerie theleader of his guild. Before he gave the faerie his essense he requestedto her that he would like his body frozen at the entrance to his guild.The faerie told him that she would do this. Before he left he turned tothe peddler and grinned as he slayed him. \"This shall be kept a secretyoung faerie.\" The faerie mearly nodded and accepted the king's essence. She then turned to dig the hole in which she would bury him in. When she had finished freezing the king and had buried him she turned and left for the Tirun Square.
