First is the Astrel, thenPlanetel then Solel.Each new guardian is inherently better than the last, though the stats and skills of the player influence those of the Guardian. For example: Astrels can cast cure, and they have 50healing+playershealing. But Solels have 200healing + playershealing, and they also have shield, boost and can sue abils in combat, rather than just idles.Solels are buff enough to take a fall for whoever they guard.If a player is good enough to summon a Planetel then he can summon 2 Astrels. If he can summon a Solel he can summon 2 Planetels/3Astrels/1Planetel and 1 Astrel. The trick with this is that while he can summon to Planetels who are both good, it means sacrificing the better abilities of the Solel.For the Solel sacrificing itself, the player would not be able to summon another guardian again until after reboot.Casting the spell takes 10 rounds (you are paralyzed for that time), must be done out of safe/magic zones, and you msut have max mp when you start, since it will use all of it.I have more ideas for how the guardians stats/skills will be afftected by the casters hp/sp/mp/stats/skills/level.Druids could get something similar where once they get to 30 they go to the grove and choose an element. That element determines what guardians they can summon (fire/earth/water/air). Each of those 4 types could have 3 levels, and be similar to the Astrel/Planetel/Solel system. - Prator",]),(["size":118,"owner":"wolfspirit","date":1045127551,"title":"Re: Prator: MORE ideaness","message":"I like this idea.
