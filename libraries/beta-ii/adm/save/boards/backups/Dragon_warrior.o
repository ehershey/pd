I only paid gold for the guild, where the guild ends up in the future lies in each and every one of you.  Couple of notes I must make before I sign off this post.  First thing is that this is not a warring guild, if you decide to take on a guild, you do it all by your lonesome self.  I have notified all the other guilds of this decision.  Second thing is, I don't expect much out of you, the only thing I would like to see is an active participation on the board and lines, what you do on your free time is nobody's buisness but yours.  The main thing is to have fun or die trying :PHepualahaole","size":712,]),(["title":"membership","owner":"daboura","date":1039328793,"message":"Ok all you squires, I've decided that we need to have something you guys can do to become members. I don't want these tasks to be easy by any means. I also want to have a statue of limitations for squires, meaning if someone joins the guild, and doesn't complete thier task by the alotted time, they shall be removed. I intend to \"grandfather\" in all squired curently in the guild now, but I also expect you guys to try these tasks. I have yet to decide whether I want there to be generel tasks, or ones that I make up to challenge each individule person, post all comments on this, and suggestions.Daboura - the evil one.","size":625,]),(["title":"councilers","owner":"daboura","date":1039559241,"message":"Ok folks, heres the deal, I want another counciler. I would like there to be four, 2 for each leader. I would like for the councilers to be represenatives of the members to the leaders. And when hep has ker baby, all 4 would answer to me. I still like the idea of each counciler having a function. So with that I will discuss functions. I'm not to certain how much azire can participate because of her immortal status, endbringer may more then likley not be playing at all, and buddah, well buddah is good, and has activev alts, so as long as i know which alts are his and I have a way to contact him, it will be fine. But I would like to hear from azire on how she can be a useful counciler. I am also going to want to put a statue of limitation on any idle squire, as soon as I talk this over wuth hep, i hope to set a day from which I will start a 3 week countdown, any squire not logging on within that time will be dismissed. I may also do this with some members whi have been more idle, but the only one I see is suri that has not been on in a while, but I still see her from time to time. I want this because I want to clear out anyone who doesn't want to contribute to the guild. please post any comments about this.","size":1225,]),(["title":"MUST READ!!!","owner":"hepualahaole","date":1041011072,"message":"I'm in favor of \"cleaning house\".  So therefore by January 31, 2003, I must have a mudletter from each player that wishes to remain in the guild.  On Feb. 1, 2003, if I don't have this mudletter, your char will be removed from the guild and a copy of this post will be attached to your mailbox.As for the councilor positions, that will have to wait till this clean-up as passed through, each of the councilors that are there now have served the guild in positive ways, but it's hard to continue serving the guild if no one shows up.  So this \"cleaning house\" will also affect this position if I don't recieve a mudletter from you.As far as Azire goes, she may remain as a councilor, only because she is on often enough, and she knows my temperment.  If anyone steps out of line, she can take care of it on the behalf of the guild.  BUT, she is exempt from her previous responsibilites to the guild because she has to remain neutral to the mud itself.Now, in this mudletter, I would like a little paragraph of what you expect from this guild, and what you think the guild will expect of you.  Doesn't have to be long, a couple of sentences will do.  The reason for this is I want to see where this guild will be heading as a whole, and plus this will be kept confidential between me and you, so please be honest.Daboura will have a lot to do when I have my baby, I don't plan on disappearing all together, but till I get use of having a third person to worry about, the guild will pretty much be in his hands.  So, I have a couple of months to get the guild up to par,  so I need to ask a favor from all you guys.  Please keep after me about the new rooms, I have the descripts, now all I have to do is flag someone to put them in.  First will be the locker room, gotta see if we are going to keep the houses, if we are, those will go in second.  Anyone who knows how to make weapons/items/armour please go on builders and create a couple for the guild.  I'm not picky of what it is, but I'm picky what it's made of. IT MUST HAVE SOME RELATIONSHIP TO THE DRAGON.  Just run the idea by me so I can let others know it's being worked on.Okay, don't forget to mudmail me, and happy hunting!Hep","size":2197,]),(["title":"please read","owner":"hepualahaole","date":1041745452,"message":"Starting Feb 1, 2003, the gollowing guild changes will be in place.1. Everyone that wishes to join the dw must report to daboura.  We will no longer just induct strangers or alts.2. Everyone present in the guild will be knocked down to squire status.  To advance to member you must arena another squire.  The winner will become a member.  This will go on till we have 8 pre-selected slots filled up on the member's board.  After which, to obtain member status, as a squire, you must arena a member for the slot, the winner takes the slot.     A. Exception to this, if a member is inactive for three months without first consulting daboura or myself, will be booted and the slot will be opened.***More info on how this will be achieved will be posted at a later date***3. Councilor position:  you must report to daboura and he will give you a quest and a challenge, once both have been compleated, you'll have assigned duties, failure of these duties will be an automatic boot to squire position.  If you are absent for 3 months without a prior notification to Daboura or myself will also get you booted to squire position.***More on this topic will be discussed at a later date***I realize that we went from one extreme to another, but apparently the other way wasn't working.  This guild will try to be like other guilds, but still live up to the guild help.  Please re-read the help dw if you forget what the mission of this guild is about.  Please keep up with this board, amements to this post will be posted as daboura and I discuss the future of this guild...If you wish to participate, we will set up a time where we can all sit back in the guild hall and discuss the future.  Otherwise, the ideas will reflect only what daboura and I see fit.
