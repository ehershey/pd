Covens range in size from as few as three members to as many as hundreds.Haematodipsia: A strong form of haematophilia. Haematomania: A strong psychological craving for blood. Haematophilia: An erotic attraction to the taste, sight (or smell) of blood. Haven: A Vampyire nightclub or other gathering place. Considered hallowed ground, the haven serves as the social hub of a given community, providing a place where all the community can gather and socialize. Often, special functions arranged by the vampiric community in an area are held at the local haven. Kithal: A vampire who is a member of more than one coven.Primus: A vampyre, almost always an elder, who founded or is the leader of a large family or coven of vampires. Sanguinarian: Someone who has a physical thirst / need / craving for blood (which is non-erotic in nature) in more significant quantity than is generally required or desired by other blood-drinkers see also \"real vampire\". Sanguinarians (not an ego term, merely a word from the same Latin root that I got my name from, meaning \"bloodthirsty\" -- which is why I chose what I chose as my name) apparently do not get the benefits from pranic energy (whatever that is...), or else they are unable to feed psychically like psi / energy vampires, for whom blood and pranic energy are apparently interchangeable. Sigil: The identifying symbol of a house, haven, coven, or individual. The sigil often has ritual or symbolic significance for the members of the household.Sin nomine: Latin for \"without name\". A vampire who has been stripped of his/her name and recognition within the community for having committed some great crime in the eyes of the community.Sire: A term from Vampire: The Masquerade roleplaying system that has crept into general usage meaning the one who turned (or awakened) someone who is a vampire.Solitary: A vampire who chooses not to be involved with a coven and has little if any interest in interacting within the communityStrigoi Vii: A term meaning \"living vampire\" in Romanian folklore, it is used to refer to the condition and philosophy of being a vampire. ... seee ya learn something new everyday :)",]),(["size":37,"date":1051618279,"owner":"endbringer","title":"New peeps","message":"Everyone Welcome Ruin and Envy!Moo.",]),(["size":136,"date":1051848109,"owner":"endbringer","title":".","message":"I am no longer an Exper on Primal Darkness, i will still be around if you guys want. :) but dont expect for me to get you anything, lol",]),(["size":72,"date":1051869423,"owner":"bayushi","title":"bags","message":"For the time being, if anyone needs a bag or 2, let me know if I'm on. ",]),(["size":23,"date":1052011867,"owner":"ruin","title":"re: endy","message":"Good, more mobs for me",]),})
