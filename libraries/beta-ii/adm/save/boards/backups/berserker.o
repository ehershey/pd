I guess I will catch you later.Cookieok, next up, as an edit while I was playing. I did some math. Given it's a ratio, not an addition now, this won't be right, but if I lost 60+ on rage, let's say I gain 12 on both attack and rage per level, it will take me about 6 levels to get back to where I was. Now, with a ratio, it gets harder and HARDER to increase the ratio one point. Like, if you use 75% of one, and with it increasing in cost to improve that skill one point, with a ratio, you have to spend TONS of xp to increase it 4 or 5 or 10 skill points, to get only one more \"rage-boost\" point. So, yea... next...NS, if this was based any off of when you teleported to me in the tenebrea throne room while I was raged, make sure it's understood that I can't do that on the whole room. I took out all the 35K+ mobs first. So that could have been misleading if that was any reason you used as a wager. If not, then nix all that. Now then, It seems like our defense goes down a little less. If this is true, was this based on the hope of equaling out the drop in attack boost? The tiny boost in defense, if it exists, has made little to no difference. So, yea, I hope there was no change with that based in mind since it made no difference. Bah, I am sure this just seems like a player ranting and raving and whinning. I don't mean it to seem like this. I've just played a berserker longer than any other player that I know of on the mudd. I've died MANY times due to rages BIG drawbacks. We all know those. No oils, no running, no lines, no anything really. With all the things out there that smacks down berserkers, like paralysis as a BIG one. If it's all or nothing, I really did see and believe that the old ratio's were very fair. I've died 12 times due to rage, it made me mad, but I sucked it up because that's the risk you take in raging. Since the change, it really has been noticable as to the weaker effect of raging than it used to be. If we have to loose more defense to get that attack level back, I think it would be worth it. Berserkers go crazy, they get huge attack bonuses, but they attack everything, feel no pain, don't care what damage they take (more proof of the defense decrease), and just go crazy. Eh... whatever, just my two cents.Once more, thanks for the good benifits in the different weapons and such.

I really really really really really (you get the point) like the raging with melee not slashing and doing other moves you can't. (no 'You have no weapon to slash with!' messages) Now.. I don't wanna hassle ya but the two things that are bothering me atm are that I am still doing 0 dmg with headbutt/choke, which I can't avoid doing when raged.. and that when I slash I still get the 'You are too tired.' message, although not as often. I'm guessing this is because as a raknid my slash costs so much, so maybe if you put the sp you go down to too 200 or 250 sp or something, this would avoid ever getting that problem. Also.. I think that some sort of new berserker only melee move is needed, since apart from rush there is very little abilities we can do with melee that are worthwhile. So heres my new berserker melee move, flame at will:gouge: 'You gouge the eyes of your opponent and they scream in pain.' This would to me be good sort of roleplay for berserkers, and nice to have so we have something original. I think it should do dmg based on mainly melee and strength, and its weaknesses be dex and def. Perhaps it could be made as an inbuilt move with rage only.

I did a double check just to make sure, and damage is not based off of sp in the slightest.  There's not a single check for what your sp is while calculating damage for melee damage.  I'm fairly certain that there are no sp based weapon specials, either (although I'm not about to check each weapon for it).

I guess I will just have to try melee again at a higher level.I know we are fairly balanced, however we are a bit same-old same-old, get some swords, max skills kill things, I would like to use melee and actually get a return for it, for I spent an awful lot of xp getting it up :P",]),(["size":1014,"title":"Melee Speicals","date":1046236149,"owner":"ug","message":"I have also had some ideas for new melee move/specialsShotgun -- You lean away from your enemies blow, and counter with a flurry of shotgun punches to the bodyThis could be used similar to mage robes, a chance of stopping an enemies attack, and doing a small/medium amount of damage back to them.Eye gouge -- You rake your hand accross your foe's face, making their eyes bleed painfully.This could again be either a speical or move, and as an extra effect make players not be able to see for a moment, getting the message: There is too much blood in your eyes to see.Dash -- You spring forward with surprising speed and dash up to the enemies guard.I think this should be a move, that after you have done it, you get extra melee idle attacks for 2-3 rounds, but you cant do anything else... aka getting up close to your foe, and unloading lots of punches into them.Thats all I can think of for a bit, but I belive these should be not that hard to implement, and bringe melee up to a better standard.",]),(["size":105,"title":"coments","date":1046320868,"owner":"ug","message":"Well I was hoping to get some comments from the other zerkers..... or am I the only active one now... :(",]),(["size":198,"title":"LOL","date":1047847373,"owner":"daboura","message":"HA! only active zerker!RIGHT!!!, I'm always here!but yes, I've been complaining about melee for what feels like a decade now.

But plenty a berserker use weapons as well. Sometimes something keen like a sword or axe... sometimes a table. Fact is though, If you punch someone in the face with you hand, while that does do alot of damage, could stun them, break bones and the like... if I had to choose the less painful or lethal way to get hit, I'd choose with \"melee\" instead of the alternative... Being slashed across the face by a huge freaking broadsword. Melee - Punched, maybe a combo taking medium to potentialy high impact damage... Blades - Sliced, gored, stabbed, punctured, torn, ect in possible combos taking medium to extremly lethal amounts of damage. Now, we could throw in bludgeoning weapons here too... like hammers and staffs and stuff, but it's still going to end up the same way. Melee is cool, but weapons are better. Ever seen Indiana Jones? The big buff dude in the terbine comes out, swinging this huge as heck sword all over the place getting ready to fight? What happens? Indiana Jones pulls out his gun, shoots him, the guy dies... the gun is put away and he moves on. That's the more or less same thing when comparing Melee to weapons. (I am not including Monks in this... as with monks or other classes that shouldn't believe in using weapons should get oober butt-kickingness without weapons, but for our purposes... since we use anything, the above statements still apply.)Just My simple thoughts.      ~Cookie",]),(["size":235,"title":"Indy","date":1052072822,"owner":"hermes","message":"You know, originally that scene called for a long drawn out fight, but Harrison Ford had dysentry and was incredibly sick.
