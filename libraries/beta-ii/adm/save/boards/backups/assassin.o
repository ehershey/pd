None of their skills could be used if you were more or less constraining them.  If this seriously needs to be changed why not make backstab useable anytime.  Not as a first strike.  And if we even want it to go further have a new skill created like 'assassinate' for a finishing move.  If this were to go into place of course backstab would not be as powerful, where as assassinate would be as, if not more, powerful then the current backstab.  If things were put together like this though I think backstab should be in place of jab (as we wouldn't want to offset the balance of power around here) keeping stab as the main attack during combat.Khale may be able to give a better explantion as he knows where my basis of this is coming from.  It is actually from another mud.  Don't know if it would be a good idea to 'copy' the ways of others but if we are talking about practicality here would be, in my opinion, the best way to go.

Not trying to put down your idea or anything but assassinate and backstab and stab are like your basic attacks that you could find in 455 out of 500 MUD's basically.To make it more fair towards the one being attacked you could probably add a basic command for every player, such as struggle, or something to that affect which would attempt to break out of the choke before too much damage has been dealt. It could rely on str and dex or something.As I said earlier i still like this idea i still think it would be cool to pull off on someone.",]),(["size":1052,"owner":"shinkoro","date":1035739406,"title":"Garrote","message":"Garrote is a form of suffication used by medevil assassins.  By the use of a leather cord wrapped around the hands, it was placed over the head and around the victims neck.  Then it was twisted tightly and the assassin used thier body weight to put pressure on the garrote killing them.Of course this method was a bit tricky, and involved alot of luck but it rendered the victim helpless truggling against the garrote and the assassin was also restrained during the strangling.I think this kinda ability really wont help the assassin subclass in gaining exp unless it was used during partys to give a para effect.  But then again if it was used to drain sp from whoever you used it on then it might help.  Draining sp from mobs makes the damage we inflict more deadly from bodydamage.  They struggle against the garrote of course draining massive amounts of sp while it would be more minimal to us since all we have to do is lean back with the victim.Just my two cents.  I like things the way they are.

You're screwed. If someone starts strangling you and you just sit there and let them then you're gonna die most likely.Sneaking into the room/cloaked/stealth on or whatever would most likely increase the chances at strangling someone. Example:You begin to move stealthily towards <player> with your <bare hands or choking item> attempting to avoid his/her/it's notice.(At this point it would probably take a few rounds to sneak up to him/her/it and choke them.
