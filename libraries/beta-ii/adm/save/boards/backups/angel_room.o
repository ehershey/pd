If everyone got a skill that holyfire/massacre were based off so everyone had an equal holyfire and massacre would be good aswell. But if you ask for that skill and not make it an additional spell like stormbringer has proposed, it would make it very uneven for alot of classes. Im not gonna go and tell yo ublah blah ill give a few examplesFirst of Assassin Angels i dont know how you ppl plucked getting one but lol imagine backstab holyfire and as holyfire hits circle. first off bs does good dmg then a holyfire and circle hitting at the same time would add another 1k dmg to that bs making an Assassin Angel a very powerful class at pking and xping. Imagine being able to kill a drow in 2 rounds. FighterA fighter with there massive bonus in hit points. with an equal powerful holyfire as any other class would be very very hard to kill. after elite for most fighters it's not to hard to get 2k hitpoints and with an all powerful holyfire that they can combo atm with there slash and charge etc would make them quite good at doing whatever they wanted to. And if your a paladin it just makes it all the more interesting doesnt it. with cure boost etc.Personally i think that making holyfire AND massacre an additional move and giving both angels and demons a skill to train to make them do more dmg would be a good idea. But if there is a cap once it's reached will people stop training that skill or what will happen?? i see this change as making peopel actually play there class instead of being oh he is an angel run from him he will blow you away with Holyfire. Or he dont get faith he is a wuss lets get him. Being able to combo moves i would hope to think make xping and arenaing etc more enjoyable as you think of different combinations to do, ones that work good against fighters and ones that work good against clergy/mages. Angels and demons both get 2 attack abils. Levin and Holyfire/ Gore and Massacre. i really would be interesting to see what stormbringer is going to do with each of these moves. Remember he is here to make our mudding more enjoyable not make it boring.Now i know im only a lvl 20 Angel Ranger so i dont have holyfire or even Levin. And if i had them they wouldnt do any dmg for me. thats why i like the idea of the additional use because it evens out all the angels and makes them equal. Then it's your choice on what kind of moves you want if you want cure paralyze etc go cleric. you wanna punch kick have skin as tough as steel go monk.

I see your logic there.I think Angel classes would balance it out. Our abils as they are are unbalanced amongst angels as some classes have better skills for the abils than others.By giving us all the same skills to base the abilities off, some people will be better off than others. Clerics/Paladins have cure and boost, fighters have coupdegrace and rogues have backstab and circle. But monks, druids and mages? They don't have any outstanding support abilities.To get it all balanced out maybe we could have our own classes. This could be cool, but it might take time to get them in, and even longer to balance them not only with each other but with standard classes.Or, perhaps you could make something like a second subclass?Example: All fighter angels get special abilities from their race according to their class. These abilities are based off main fighter skills, with maybe some bonuses from their subclass skills (valor, ferocity, theotherone)Example2: All clergy get spells based on faith, maybe with some bonuses from nature/belief/andsomethingnewformonks. For mages it is MA/MD/[wizardry/sorcery/pyromonacy].In fact, perhaps take it a little further. Say all clergy get a spell called holyfire, but for each of us it looks different. Druids summon the power form the earth, clerics from the heavens, monks from their own inner chi. This is reflected in hte messages, and perhaps the messages even have different colours?Oh yeah, Kai: Levin isn't based off faith, it is based off attack. I can tell because Gabe's does more dmg than mine atm.Note: Hermes, your opinion was based on you *thinking* that I have powerlevelled and only raised faith. I haven't told anyone my skills or stats, so unless an immortal is telling you, you couldn't know. True, I did get through levels very fast, and even if I *was* powerlevelled I have still made somewhere around 500million exp at this level, which has made me, you know, a little better than before. :NoteEnough now. - Prator","owner":"prator","size":2128,]),(["date":1043485070,"title":"M'kay","message":"I'm not going to get into an argument with you on the Angel board.  But you and I both know how your stats and skills look right now.  But I'm not going to tell you how to play your character.Getting onto the subject.Holyfire is weak.  At level fifty with max Faith and Magic Attack, I do not do nearly as much as I should do.The fact that a fighter with worse *stats* then me can almost XP as fast as me using the same XP routes tells me that I'm underpowered.  Espically considering that Holyfire is an area attack.Angels recieving their own class wouldn't be cool.Frankly, at first it would be either massivly overpower or massivly underpowered.  And then it would be complained about and balanced and go the other way making for more headaches in both directions as this is human fallacy that comes from the introduction of any radical change.I *do* like the idea of a different angel ability for the different subclasses.  But it must be balanced very carefully to avoid the obvious uber advantage of an Angel assassin or an Angel fighter.Levin is useless, everyone knows that.  But I'm here about holyfire, not something I never used twenty five levels ago.Right now, the \"ideal\" angel is a clergy angel.  As they get the most faith per level.  I'll even go so far to say that they are cleric angels as they are the most abusive with holyfire.  But what happens to us? We get massivly raped by raknids and I would like to say something else here but it's information that I don't know is public knowledge and as such, won't.I guess it comes down to my frustration that I really didn't get much for fifty levels.  For a little less armor I could get two more arms and do much much more damage and get it fifty levels ago.But I digress.Prator, you're wrong.  I don't know how much simplier I can get it, but if you wish I can drag in calculus and we can start doing limits as it relates to damage potential of several different abilities.Stormbringer, I like your idea but the cap is way to low.  I know you're trying to avoid overpowering us but let us not forget that we *did* sacrifice fifty levels for this ability and as such we should be more powerful then someone of a similar level/skills/stats/class who is not an angel.Frankly, I'm tired of doing piss poor damage vs a level thirty five raknid with no stats or skills who is running around raping everything with quad slash or backstab.And maybe this is because I'm a druid and can't be properly abusive like a cleric can.  But I'm pretty sure that Loki is pretty much in agreement with me here, and he even has a para move which I, as a druid, do not.Gabriel, I don't know what to say man.  You do pretty good without holyfire in my opinion but I don't mind listening to what you have to say.Same with the other angels.One final suggestionI would ask that was close and move the angel quest.

Stats don't play a huge part, I know for a fact.Ah, now you are comparing HF to raknids. Which is a seperate issue altogether. Raknids are not normal, they are unique in having four arms. If you think you don't do enough damage comapred to a Raknid, then perhaps it is tht Raknids should be made quest races? A demon anti-paladin does less damage than a Raknid anti-paladin, yet demons are better than pretty much any other race for a fighter.As I said, it would be very difficult and take a very long time to get balance right for new classes.It was a different ability for defferent classes, and of course it would be balanced, since only rogues would get their class angel move, and only rogues have backstab. You would work it out with this in mind.HF doesn't do alot of dmg when you attack multiple mobs, but so what? If you are fighting 2 monsters you are doing 25% extra damage (than holyfire target) for the same mp cost. Against the 13 or so mobs in the throne room? Still the same mp cost.The advantage is killing more mobs at once. If you can't take the damage at the moment, max MD and def. Exp with a buddy so the damage is spread.Levin being useless: yes, so why not change that instead of an ability that we only get at our second instance of level50?Anyway, I don't mind if damage for holyfire is upped, but changing it to an extra ability, with a dmg cap? Remove the dmg cap maybe, but then it might get too powerful.Maybe, if you just *holyfire* it would work as an extra ability. But if you *holyfire target* it counts as a main attack move. The former doing half the dmg of the latter?LOL, then you might be able to *holyfire* and *holyfire target* in the same round, that'd be funny.Anyway, for balance Stormbringer: *holyfire target* does about as much as my lifewarp when I max belief/faith/healing - Prator","owner":"prator","size":1998,]),(["date":1043490000,"title":"and","message":"And think about that.

There was a time it would do 1200, easy.  I know that's a bit *to* much, but let's just find the middle ground here.1200 - 700 = 500 % 2 = 250700 + 250 = 950.I can work out a formula for that but anyway, considering my wisdom and my *Maxed skills* at level 50 (congrunt to level 100) I can tell you the damage potential is just to low.What is damage potential? Damage potential is a funny little word the means a lot of nothing unless you apply it to damage values versus expected damage values.Using a little calculus we have a limit which I will hearforth designate as N(Why? Because the first letter of my name is an N)N represents Holyfire damage potential.Using the formula of holyfire (which I am keeping secret), I determine that as damage rises (Normally with limits we say as X goes to infinity but in this case we are capping the X value to the highest possible value or HPV it can obtain)Anyway, as damage rises to HPV, N goes to .86.How did I get that?By using the derivative of N and the damage calculation of holyfire, I can reach N = .86 + XWhich would mean  N -.86 = XX = -.86 but we take the absolute value and then assign N and get N = |.86|Anyway, Holyfire is doing 86% of what it should be doing according to the damage potential.Now, here comes the second partHow did I get all this?  I used slash as a comparisonMore specificly, the slash of Cookie as he is right now with his stats and skills.And through the use of Sequences I get the numbers into which I can use my damage limitations and thus my damage potential.Then I just rounded off the change toa  nice easy number which resulted in a damage adjustment of positive 175.But I still think it should be 250 as the extra 75 really helps against the Raknid fighters/rogues.If anyone wishes to see my calculations in greater detail, I'll transfer them from the paper to a medium that you can see.  Don't ask me to mudmail them because they wouldn't survive the transition in any way that could make any sort of sense.Anyway, thanks for listening to my ramblings and for those who have short attention spans, here is my main goal re-stated:Holyfire needs about a 175-250 damage adjustment at my level with my skills and my stats.","owner":"hermes","size":2932,]),(["date":1043619601,"title":"yeah","message":"I was just going to suggest a *1.2 modifier at the end of it but yeah, whatever.Anyway, I noticed something I found VERY amusingAn elf sorc's int at 100 costs exactly the same as, get this, an Archangel Cleric's at 100. - So much for superior stats...

You know that since I'm immortal I really don't care all that much any more about who beats who. But, because I want to prove myself as worthy of being a balancer, I would just like to say how I approach this.First off, with Druids having no reason to have faith. I think you're thinking in a bit to much of Merentha terms.In Merentha, Druid's are magic users which use nature.  In PD, Druids worship nature which gives them faith. They don't have to believe in the god(s) that Paladins, clerics, or Kataans do to recieve their faith.  They could worship a mushroom growing off of some guys butt and as long as they believed in it enough and it would grant them their strength then they would be considered faithful.In this case, nature grants them strength.  Just think of Nature as a God if it makes it better for you.But this isn't a theology debate at all, this is what I believe Druids represent in PD.Getting onto Paladin's.  Let's face it, 6 faith a level would make you way over powered.  You can't have your cake and eat it to.You already have cure, boost, slash, smite, and an assortment of other treasures. To have a holyfire that's just as powerful as a clergy class would make the Paladins unbalanced as hell.You would have all the strengths of the fighter, plus a good deal of the strengths of a clergy with very few to none of the weaknesses.You have to pick one or another, either a good holyfire but weak body.  Or a rather powerful body but weak holyfire.It all comes down to balance.  Sure, your arguments about Paladins having a lot of faith have merit, I agree.  But sometimes logic must be put aside in the intrests of balance.If you were to get six faith per level, I would dare say pretty much everyone would complain, and rightfully so in my opinion.  Pretty much all of the monks and solitary druid have worked rather hard with underpowered spells and abilities to get to a point where we could make a dent with holyfire.Meanwhile, stun + slash + Holyfire + smite just doesn't seem to equal balance in my opinion.","owner":"hermes","size":2119,]),(["date":1045810616,"title":"hermes","message":"most of your argument does have merit and i agree, except for that part about giving paladins being over powered with 6 faith. i mean what would it change?? one players holyfire and that is all, and lets not forget the dmg balance that we just had, now against prator i used to do 400dmg with slash i konw do 150 so slash isn't all it used to be, and also i am the same lv as him with far better str and dex so thinking in terms of that how come they can have a strong body and strong magic and i can't, and i don't want it for all magic just holyfire seeing as though it is a race ability after all.

It was changed apparently to make it stronger for the non cleric,druid,monk,paladin classes amd not just laughable like Halo's is/was =). The classes who get the 'good' holyfire are druid,monk,cleric and paladin. The first three could be considered to be some of the under powered magic classes in the game and weaker in general(besides jester/bard ofcourse --banged) i have gotten to elite with druid and monk and pretty much cleric aswell so i know what i am talking about. Druid and monk, they CANNOT compare to fighters and rogues and such they cannot make the same amount of exp or kill the same strength of mobs. And cleric they are the only real spell casters who do not get an area effect spell(these are very important because of exp cuts)So holyfire was actually sort of a balance out, although archangel cleric is \"hackless\", a non archangel druid/monk is just a waste of time at higher levels. In arena my strongest move does about 50 damage now on a 6-hit furystrike to people 20 levels lower than me(raknids to with weak armour) and at level 37 my circlekick did not do more than 20 dmg, but monk moves are another story and druids are worse off actually. And because of exp cuts, clerics are not that strong either because it seems everyone now has to have an area effect spell. And paladins they get a not as strong holyfire because they do the mass dmg with their idle attacks, so they are not in as much of a rut as druid.monk.cleric are. Ok so then we get onto holyfire itself. Before my holyfire did at maximum 450 dmg to a player with <holyfire target> and bout 300 or so maybe with generic <holyfire>. Sure the 450 dmg is strong but take Titanis' psistorm it does about 250 to my alt and he is level 37 with an area effect that strong while I am ~20 lvls higher I only do an extra 100 damage with all my extra skills. My holyfire is not actually that strong. Now before I was making about 8mill an hour on average killing 25k mobs in 2 rounds 30k mobs in 3 rounds and forbidden forest mobs in like 6 rounds I think. Taking into account exp cuts before I wasn't actually making much more exp than a lvl 37 and I was having to kill harder mobs(forbidden forest) and lots more of them(cleaning lodos/sewers/merk/tene) just to make slightly more exp than they did per hour. //Exp cuts are another matter all together. So I was only making slightly more exp than people I'm 20 lvls higher and I am a quest race. Seriously what are the benefits of archangel, I can fly(I can either walk to most areas faster(and I do) or merk or bfields non archangels can just mark a wax)) so I save a little money .. we all know how important money is here. Spin halo is nice but seals just do the same, I can kill demons but also be killed by demons. Being killed is a much greater disadvantage than what is gained from killing a demon. There is levin and holyfire. Levin is rarely used and only for kicks and holyfire before this was really why people turned angel for. Now without holyfire the only real benefit is better stats, but there is no way going back to level 1 and being hunted by demons justifies just better stats. The negatives FAR outweigh the advantages of quest races, for demons even more so They get the worse end of the stick. Sure maybe non faith users get a slightly better holyfire now but they knew that they would get a weak holyfire when they decided to be wizard/assassin/gyspy. And now with the new holyfire, I was told i should be doing approximately the same dmg, but i am doing 50% of the damage i was doing previously. The same player I did 450 previously I do just over 220 damage I don't even want to think how much <holyfire> does if holyfire target does so little. It takes me twice as long to kill mobs, 30k mobs now take 6 rounds. While lvl 37's titanis/specula, I was told it takes them 2-3 rounds. It takes me 3 rounds to kill 25k mobs including exp cuts I get 16k in that time specula can kill 2 mobs of the same exp and get 50k. THIS IS NOT BALANCED. Before if anything the general view of Hermes/Prator and most other angels who used holyfire was that holyfire was to be improved I think by 20% but not this significant downgraded if you want wisdom to play a greater role make it do its old damage PLUS the extra wisdom damage as Prator said that it was a little weak as \"Character 10vls+ below me doing more dmg with a multi-hitting move? I don'tmind the same dmg at the same skills and everything. But *more* dmg with 15%less skills (and who kows what stats)? I don't think so.\", this is just wrong I make 4mill an hour now. Takes me 9 rounds to kill a 38k mob which exp cuts turn into 26k where specula makes that much in previously said 2 rounds. NOT BALANCED. Even without the exp cuts I get now, fighters/sorcs/rogues exp faster than me, taking into exp cuts they exp almost twice as much as fast as I do. I was making 8 mill before that's about right I think even though lvl 37's make almost that much or even more, I am making 4 mill an hour now and it is frustrating to kill mobs now simply because they take too long do die, exping is not enjoyable.Return holyfire to what it was, it was strong before but balanced.","owner":"tyste","size":5220,]),(["date":1045828375,"title":"gabriel","message":"You only say that because everyone else copped the hf downgrade i was never wrong and i am not doughy not even sometimes your the one who expects everyone to be withering in front of you like worms and you wanted more faith so you can get a better hf you have said so so many times prator has heard it and so has halo you want more more more you think i am doughy eh ? you didn't even understand my last post about the reaper you idiot the fact that hf does less now now you say omg use your head it would do less now you say it you chook omg i think everyone is going to agree with me when they say you wanted a stronger hf and have been complainiging how crap you are you have alot more moves then half the angels and they are good i think you should play an alt and see other bloody classes and how they work omfg YOU DON\"T HAVE ANY ALTS AND HAVEN\"T PLAYED ANY OMG SO YOU WOULDN\"T KNOW ANYTHING ","owner":"odysseus","size":899,]),(["date":1045830567,"title":"Ody & Gab","message":"Just posting to say that i dont believe Paladins should get 6 faith alvlhmhm, ive had this argument with gabriel before, and we wont just give up and face the facts that it would make them more higher on the ladder of 'Cheatyness'Reasons being as said by others and myself, you would have the best of the fighters (slash, charge, etc) and then have the best of the angels (hf, levin-lol)hmm, Fighter Hiypoints with clergy Hf - cheatyBefore you were complaining all the time about getting more Faith for a better holyfire, now thats its been downgraded, your telling everyone to shutup, you should take your own advice.","owner":"vlad","size":623,]),(["date":1045830673,"title":"ps","message":"ps: i feel sorry for Loki and Tyste, now they cant do any dmg..","owner":"vlad","size":64,]),(["date":1045835704,"title":"admins","message":"ok ok, im not gonna argue with you anymore, your still wron you just can't see outside yourselfs, so to the admins put it back that way it was, that way you can have just me complain about it and not 70million other people who don't get it. and to vlad and odysseus try compareing a normal angel/paladin to yourselfs not me cause i am way to buff for you guys so naturaly my holyfire with 6 faith is gonna bend you, what do you expect. and before you get on your high horse \"he thinks he's so good\", i can idle you both before you can slash me to death. so its a statement of fact not a strut, thou i doubt you will see it that way.im sick of this conversation, go away.-Gabriel","owner":"gabriel","size":682,]),(["date":1045835928,"title":"oh yeah","message":"oh yeah and odysseus you brought it up on paladin board, i never said anything till you started it, so don't give me that shit.,","owner":"gabriel","size":130,]),(["date":1045845166,"title":"gotta have faith","message":"gabriel i didn't start anything you wine 24/7 about faith i have people OMG THE PRINT SCREEN of you complaining 24/7.com the only thing you can say is you can't think outside ourselves and get over it what is there to get over? and you don't even know what the word outside means and you stupid idiot after how many posts you still don't understand what i meant probably because you don't think outside the freaking paladin you play with play some alts ffs and learn something new you sit there 24/7 complaining and talking bs and don't talk crap about comparing a normal paladin angel to for ourselves CAUSE I WAS ONE for ages and then you turn around saying paladins need this abil they need that then you get the rest of the paladins not just me turning around and putting you in your place you don't talk on behalf of no one only yourself well guess what no one is going to be withering in front of you and don't go saying that other people don't get it we get your bs complaining 24/7.COM and make me go away if your going to start trying to flex your paladin strength ","owner":"odysseus","size":1076,]),(["date":1045845240,"title":"lol","message":"im not a paladin.and yeah, i know you can idle me to death, its called me not playing thus for not getting better.And how did you get those stats? holyfire got them, imagine if it was a 6fa a lvl holyfire, you would be even more cheatier ;)capice","owner":"vlad","size":250,]),(["date":1046403960,"title":"Holyfire","message":"Ok I will keep it short and sweet.1) Holyfire does less damage than lifewarp.2) [Holyfire monster] does less damage than [holyfire]3) It doesn't make that much sense having multi-hit spells cost so much. does it take as much effort to extend a spell to 8 from 7 as it does 2 from 1?
