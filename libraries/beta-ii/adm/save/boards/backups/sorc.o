However, I have major problems with this subclass.  Sorc is the only class I love to play, so if it's not improved soon I'm not going to play here anymore.  That's obviously not a threat cause it doesn't hurt you if I don't, but just stating a fact.  The spells are garbage for dmg, getting rid of buffer would cripple me, I get hit hard enough as it is.  A lvl 28 fighter kills me in arena, and I have better stats.  Fighter is the most over-powered cheap class on here.  They get new spells and abils every other week it seems, sorc has gotten NOTHING in months, EXCEPT downgraded.  I don't understand it, I get downgraded because I can kill a bunch of aussies, well maybe I worked hard enough to be able too?  Now I can't kill jack sh*# and it's really pissing me off.  4 rounds for a 25k with 50 wis and max ma.  Thats rediculous.  I have no para move, fighters have stun.  All they need is 3 rounds to kill anyone with slash, especialy quad f'n slash.  Why does a fighter need a para move?  A MAGE should have a para move if anything.  Things just don't make sense...they seriously don't.  I always list ideas for how to improve my class, nothing happens.  Storm, I know you're working on one spell for the class, but honestly, one spell isn't going to cut it unless it's one f'n powerful spell.  and I use psistorm to xp, so it would have to be usable with psistorm, or there's no point at all.  Kataans para with hellfire, fighters have stun, clerics have para...how is that fair?  When pk opens fighters will have a blast with everyone, except maybe high lvl rogues.  Mages are FUC#$D.  If you need more ideas, if the ones I've given aren't to your liking, atleast post something, any of you.  I don't get any feedback, no posts, nothing.  It's like the admins don't give a sh#t about mages.  I made a paladin, I see how often problems are discussed.

Unfortunately. It all comes down to who gets the first move off, always has been and probably always wil be... We have trued to balance this out but every time we do we get complaints for every single player on the mud, which means, it seems we are danged if we do and danged if we don't.I have be racking my brain for nearly a year now trying to figure a way to balance PvP and everything I try or work on changes everything about experiencing. the only way to truely fix the problem is to make para moves not work against players, cut all damage in half, and make it so no abilities work against other players unless they are already in combat.I do understand your frustration and where you are coming from, there is just no easy fix. I have changed all para moves to not work more then 2 rounds unless you are very high level, cut PvP damage by 30%, etc... I will continue to work on the problem and I try new ideas as I think of them and am alway open to new ones. Unfortunately new more powerful spells'/abils only add to the problem, not fix it.I also know I am slow on getting new stuff done. I will not try to make excuses, just to say I too am a person with a life outside the mud. I like you playing here Soulfly, I like your ideas and everything you have contributed to the mud and even though your ideas and mine conflict sometimes I have tried my hardest to make thinks meet in the middle to where even if we are not both happy with the results, at least we can both live with them.
