A lvl 25 or lvl 30 spell that can be used like an ability can. i.e. you still get your natural attacks per round, but it costs mp and is based off of your faith.This would really separate paladins form the other fighters, and it makes our characters a little more balanced, since at the moment my dispell will never be as good as a monks dispell, and our attacks and slash and so on aren't as good as that of other fighters.It also forces us to make balanced characters, since we would need better int for the mana we need, and wis to make the spell better. We would also need to train faith to make us better at it. But we need str and atk blade and so on so our normal attacks are good as well...

Similar to clerics, but different at the same time. If you look at DnD, where the 'standard' for classes is usually set, the paladin's abilities are equally divided between combat and faith.This is my idea for paladins here...Instead of being fighters who have faith and some other magic skills and so on, paladins are the most pure form of a holy warrior. They live to serve their god, and do nothing to go against their wishes. To this end paladins may not attack good-aligned creatures, as they do not kill good people.The skillset and stat modifiers reflect the paladins holy nature. They have high wisdom, con and cha, avg str, dex, low int. They only get 5 atk/lvl, and only get the wpn skills blade and blunt. In return, they get 5 faith and a new paladin only magical skill like conviction.Hmmm, also, their damage in combat is related more to valor than atk. Or, they get other moves that require valor.I could go on and on about new skills and spells/abilities and blah. but since even if you decide to change you are still too busy, here is the first step. If you like it, or if you think it is not right, can you say so?Oh, and Gabriel, Halo and I are all in agreement on this. The nature of the paladin and anti-paladin classes makes for them being a standard class kinda lame. They usually end up not being true paladins because newbs cannot be expected to play such a class. We all think that the paladin class would be better served as a quest class, attainable at lvl25(?) from any other fighter class.Want to talk on this more, but I wanna keep this at least not a full page long.	- Aziraphale",]),(["size":164,"date":1018981350,"title":"skills","owner":"stormbringer","message":"Wehn I change skill costs and update skills the first time it is used it makes the adjustments, so the amount is off.

But a monk gets 25% more faith per level, and clerics get 50% more faith, and both those classes have cheaper wis and int.

Don't read unless you have alot of time.***%^RESET%^Dispell is *my* most powerful move. If I had 60 strength then my rush and normal attacks would probably do more damage, but looking at Gabriel I don't htink it would be much of a difference.Anyway, even if rush and normal attacks did more damage than dispell at lvl 40, that is really messed up for paladins. At low levels we will be using dispell, so for us to do more damage and get more exp we need to focus on our intelligence and wisdom, and get alot of lvls since that is what dispell is mainly based off. Once we get up to higher lvls though, we are going to need good blade, attack, double wielding and strength - the skills and stats we did not need in the slightest at low lvls because they were never used.Looking at cripple, it seems as though with maxed skills this spell would do more damage than dispell, which is unfortunate since MA is very expensive. Since faith will max naturally from using dispell to exp, then dispell's damage will increase fast. Cripple does not train ma, and it is quite expensive to train with exp.*I had a long post all written out in notepad but the computer crashed and I can't be stuffed rewriting it*Basically, as an archangel I need to be as good as I can as fast as I can, this makes dispell the only feasible exp tool since I will not need to use exp to make it better as I level. The problem is that at higher levels dispell starts to become obsolete since as a fighter I get more and more normal attacks per round. However, since I spent my first 30 lvls improving int and wis, my normal fighter stats are really bad, and it is going to take me alot of time improving them to the point where abilities are more powerful than dispell. It is much more sueful just to lvl and make dispell more powerful.I thought that for a change, paladins, and all other fighters, could get a new lvl35/40 ability or spell. My idea for a paladin is, and I know I have said this before bit it still stands: Costs sp(strength) and mp((ma+faith)/4 + 50), allows paladin to use normal attacks, damage based on strength, wisdom, faith, ma, attack. The idea behind this is that the paladin imbues his weapon with holy energy and on one of his attacks discharges it upon an opponent. I thought damage could be something like: (2xstrength + 2xwisdom + ma + faith + attack) - (2x enemy dexterity + 2x enemy wisdom + (enemy defense + enemy md)/3).So a lvl 40 with max skills and 60 on all stats does 430 dmg to another with 60 dex, 60 wis and 200 def and 200 md. Plus the player's normal attacks.As a tricky rp apsect to it, perhaps the spell could do bonus damage according to the wc of your weapon, as long as it is a mysticblade. Because at the moment mysticblade is pretty useless. At any time with max faith, which is easy enought to get when using dispell to exp, our mysticblade will be nowhere near as good as a weapon we could get off a mob, and it does not auto-load, and we cannot make them more often than once very 30 minutes or so, making it almost useless after reboot or quit if you need to double wield.So far, the mysticblades I have made are:MysticbladeIce BladeThe demon-slayerThe soul-seeker bladeNone of which anyone wants because only the soul-seeker is even better than a sword of light which you can get at lvl30, but you need to be at least lvl40 as a paladin to make it. None of them special anyway so even if they did have a good WC everyone would still prefer a starscream which I can just go and get pretty much whenever.Hmm, that is all I can think of at the moment.	- Aziraphale",]),(["size":187,"date":1020686302,"title":"just a repeat","owner":"gabriel","message":"im just repeating that i suck majorly and i pretty high stats and skills, i don't do nearly enough damage for my lv,i think i might go and do something else.bah i don't know	-Gabriel",]),(["size":1096,"date":1020737638,"title":"analyze","owner":"rhuan","message":"Well i had a lvl 61 paladin... lemme do a little bit of analysis of the class here and what i think.First off for the most part i agree with aziraphale and gabriel 100%. The fact that we use dispell is rediculous in the first place.KK there are no single fighter moves that will do a lot of damage. Lvl 61 my rush was about 280 and my whirl was 310 and my maul was 300. Nice... but remeber this is lvl 61.

All in all whirl will be your high level move probably.Thats 240 damage or so at lvl 50 we'll say. Well that doesnt do much. This means that if a paladin wants to do real damage it has to come from their normal hits.

He fights with honor for the good of all.
