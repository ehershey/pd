We also have a lot of useless moves, nothing much really happens with monks (to fix them up) mostly because I am the only person who plays monk a lot.Now this post is going to be along one so be warned.I would be willing to trade in the spells limbs, mend, heal, replace, vestment, pain, rot, faithbomb. For another more useful spell such as:BlessLv - 20Description - Your deity blesses you for your devotion to the faith. Allowing Quicker regeneration for sp and hp (goes up with lv and skills)Requirements - Faith, Healing, Int, wisEffects - Makes regeneration of sp and hp raise. Percentage raises with lv's, skills and stats.Or Boost.Also other spells thoughts that might be useful for monks Such as:Rapture (Could be like the merentha one) orLv - 40 or 50 (Maxed Healing, Faith, Ma)Description - Gather the power of the gods and release it in an earth shattering flow, draining the sp, mp and hp.Factors - Faith, Magic Attack, healing, Int.Effects - Standard room effect, draining 70sp and 150mp. Also doing bout 420hp dmg and only takes on round to cast.OrPurge ( Maybe the one you removed) orLv - 50 (Maxed Faith, Magic attack)Description - Use the power of your deity to shred you foes soul (no matter what alignment).Factors - Faith, Magic attack, IntEffects - Single player, single round and about 850dmg.OrFlame strike (could be like merentha) orLv - 30 or 40 (Maxed Faith, Magic attack)Description - Send a mass of flames streaking towards your enemy.Factors - Faith, Magic Attack, Str, Int.Effects - 400-600 dmg and a chance of paralyze based on opponents wis and int.Single round and single mob.Pummel (like merentha) orLv - 2 or 20 (Maxed Melee)Description - You lay into your enemy with a volley of punches.Factors - Melee, Attack, double wielding, Str, Dex, Con.Effects - Like slash except with melee, single mob and single round. Maybe even get more per lv and skills (that is kinda like strike but strike sucks.)Or Improve strike.As well as a defensive more such as:Divine Armor - Lv - 15 (Maxed Magic Defense, Faith)Description - Your deity protects you from the harshness of the world. (magical and physical Defense)Factors - Magic Defense, Faith, ?Defense?, Int, Wis.Effects - A magical shield from magical attacks and physical attacks. Gets better with lv. And maybe immune to Para (if immune to Para it last about ½ min when first gotten) if not then maybe about 6mins at first.And just something else I thought upScriptLv - 60Description - Allows monks to write certain spells into scripts for themselves to use. (If you wrote mend on the script then read the script it would be like using mend)Factors - Conjuring, Int, wis, Healing, Faith.Effects - Writing a script of a certain spell would take however much mp as it would take to cast that spell. Only certain spells can be scripted.I would like everyone, players and immortals to look this over and take the time to see what would be ok and not to cheaty. Not to many other monks out their play often and most have stopped playing that character so I presume I speak for most people out there. If one thing here is to hard to code or isn't something you like then plz post about it I would like everyone's input to try improve the monk class.

We are weak, esspecially compared to some of the other classes.  There is also a couple reasons that we are.  Had a discussion with stormbringer about it quite awhile ago, this is about what he said.  Its been awhile so it might not be exactly accurate but close enuf.  PD2 was rushed to be put up in place of PD1, and because of that there were a few classes that got shafted.  For reasons like they were not completed or because the playtester sucked.  The classes that got hit the worst were first off the Wanderers(if you think monks are weak, go play a wanderer), and secondly Monks.  Monks mainly fell into the category of not being completed to my knowledge.  According to stormy, they were meant to be more of a martial artist, that has a limited amount of specialized spells that he termed \"chi spells\" would use either mp or sp and an example of one was \"body hardening\" a spell that you would concentrate on and it would then affect your AC.there were some others that were mentioned but i dont remember examples anymore.Now you ask, if this was the case then why are we the way we are.  Well, like i said PD2 was rushed by the players to get put up (i imagine that the imms wanted to see it up too or else they wouldnt have done it).  The problem was that not everything was completed to 100%.  Figured they would do it afterwards while the mud was up.  Thing is it wasnt that easy, esspecially with the bugs that players found while playing.  So they had to get those bugs that are more important fixxed first.  Then all the players, or at least the majority, wanted PK put into the game.  So that took precedence seeing how there were all of 2 active monks, Loki and I.  Now there is really only one active monk being LOki because i dont play too much anymore.  So justice needed to be put in for PK.This took the number 1 spot for imm attention.  After that got put into the game, it needed constant attention due to the nature of it.  Then archangel, demon, and dragon were worked on and put into the game.  I dont know what is really on the works right now, but i know by way of classes Wanders are first on the list due to the fact that they are alot worse off than we are, i think swashbucklers have 5 abilities total and no spells.  After wanderers comes monks.  Monks need alot of work, and its not something that is gonna be a quick fix.Kartoffel",]),(["title":"News.","size":807,"date":1021632595,"owner":"loki","message":"Ok, here i go again.

And the adding moves to help low monks does nothing to help me so i dont really care.Thirdly:Alot of the moves seem alittle the same with no really variation from each other or other moves on the mud except for what they are based off.Fourth:Supplication is cheaty/lame. In that it says it wears off before it actually does but it costs like 500mp or something to cast and i always find myself in negative mp when i cast it. Also i dont see it improve when i up my skills.Fifth:I never hear anything about whats going on with us, if your having trouble with ideas or anything would you atleast like to post what is going on. Also im kind of a lone voice here so you seem to go off to where more ppl are complaining.Sixth:I think we kind of have a different view of what monks should be.In my opinion they are kind of like paladins, in the effect that they are both physical and magical(in a diety sense). They use there magical power kind of like a priest does but not that powerful.Seventh:We are clergical but we arnt like clerics, druids or kataans. None of those 3 are any form of physical, they a pure magical(in a diety sense). This does not fit a monk, and in such i dont feel that the class modifiers(for stats) fit monks. All our abilities are based off str/dex and we need con to be able to survive the dmg like fighters. Our stat costs do not reflect this.Eighth:Some of my ideas.I think that as little munchicans we shouldnt be able to party with others cause monks are solitary ppl. It should be hard to get monks up but not especially hard like it used to be. Between lv 30 and 50 we should get advanced in faith and become half magical.We should get some custom skills, like technique or chi or focus.Technique - would be kind of like a dex skill, the more we put it up the better our technique the more dmg and do and less we take.Chi - It would be a kind of magical skill, the more we put this up the more chi based moves would do. At say lv 35(if we get 6 points a lv) we have 210 points(the max) we get a special msg that says your gods recognize your devotion to the faith and we grant some more power. This allows us to use new special magic chi moves.Focus - This would be a skill that the more you had the more dmg you did, it would mean you have a more concerntrated chi and your physical moves would do more.Some of our abilities could be, meditate, divine barrier, heel strike, possesion.Meditate - This would take all of our mp and sp and would be a 16 round move that can only be done outside combat in a non-safe zone. It would not improve any skills or stats or do any dmg or any defense. All it would do is it would last for 20 rounds at lv 50 with maxed skills and it would allow us to use heel strike.Heel Strike - This is a mix between an intiate combat and a normall move, it takes 2-5 rounds based on how good the opponent is. You can only do it ONCE at ANY time during combat 	and does the dmg of a power initiate combat move, seeing a lv 50 only has 20 rounds to 	get to the person and use it. It wouldnt really be usfull to xping but only for pk.Divine Barrier - It can only be cast out of combat and takes 2 rounds to get the barrier up, it is a magic defense that doesnt allow you to get into combat our someone/thing to get into combat with you. It lasts for a set amount of time based off your md, chi and wis.Possession - You summon the fury of the gods inside yourself and unleash a wicked fury upon your opponent. It causes the fury of the gods(a spirit) to take control of your body. You get bonuses to all forms of defense and can only do idle attacks, plus one special that is randomly cast by the spirit. You get bonuses to stats and hp. The spirit sucks out your lifeforce and drains a variable amount of hp a round. While possessed you cant leave battle or heal or cast magic/abilities. When you want you unpossess and you fight to regain controll of your body form the spirits.	Note: You can die from being in this form to long and you can do it anywhere, it doesnt mean you cant leave the room, but when in combat you cant leave.These are just afew of the ideas i had to make the class alittle different. -Loki the complaint freak",]),(["title":"abils","size":144,"date":1034026118,"owner":"stormbringer","message":"well we ran into some trouble today so I did not gt to finish up, I will be back tonight to work a bit on monks and work a bit tomorrow as well",]),(["title":"openpalm","size":78,"date":1037612302,"owner":"green","message":"i got it at level 5 im level 9 maxed skills still cant use it, is it a bug ??",]),(["title":"defense","size":91,"date":1038873757,"owner":"aethar","message":"I think monks should get 6 points a lvl for defense, and 5 points a lvl for magic defense.",]),(["title":"para","size":181,"date":1038954227,"owner":"aethar","message":"Could monks have a in combat para instead of a combat initialising paralyze?

The damage it does is just shocking even the much mocked levin does about x10 damage of that chistrike does. And this is a lvl ~30 move, this REALLY needs to be changed.Circlekick is very nice, but at higher levels we need something significantly stronger since we do not have an area attack spell.Furystrike is ok, weaker than circlekick though, but the 2nd and 3rd hits do significantly less damage than the first. They should all do the same. Loki's did about 100 on first hit and 40 on successive hits. They should all do the original damage. Other than that it is fine.Ironfist, this move is just APPAULING. It is supposed to be a move like jab, but at lower levels it actually does 0 damage. It neds to be made reasonably strong because at low levels melee damage sucks. But it should have a cap off like maybe 60 damage.lCrushingblow is ok, but if we are actually supposed to use this more than just for kicks it needs to be stronger perhaps circlekick damagex1.5The requirements to use openpalm are way to high the req's should be dropped down to about 20 faith. Besides that and my original point it is fine.Snapkick is ok, nothing special. Once you get circlekick it is never used again. Only suggestion maybe make it gained at a lower level.Eagleclaw this is a little iffy, coupedegrace was downgraded then upgraded again. I am not sure if eagleclaw got upgraded because when a person was at 200hp/1500 it still failed for me. If it got the upgrade i suppose it is fine.Stuntouch is ok, good use a better name though. Paintouch doesn't really have a use and seems very weak, and could use a better name but other than that it is ok.Most of our spells are ok though supplication is broken(at lvl 37 it gave me more attack then it does at lvl 50), we good use some more though maybe boost that would be very good, or something like boost which gave us sp based off faith+healing but had no arguments prayer or something. and maybe a few more other spells can't think of anything else now.FDK and chistrike(needs to be fixed!).. they send our enemies to the ground but amazingly our enemies immediately get up and decide to hit us again.

Well my ideasStuntouch is a move that paras your oponent by causing pain to their nerves.Sure we cant have it hitting all the time, but that should be based off skills and stats to weather it hits. If someone is para'd from say backstabing it is kinda dumb that we turn around and cause pain to ourselves...But as we heard that it was probably for balance and probably not ment for pking but for xping....Well mine lasts 1 entire round on a lion down in arlon... So useful for xping isnt it.Also if it is going to be balanced like that then i think we should be able to stuntouch during combat as it is just hitting a nerve and causing pain and with our expert hand to hand combat skills we should be able to do it during combat.Well just my thoughts -Loki",]),(["title":"peace","size":130,"date":1046473014,"owner":"stormbringer","message":"peace has been changed.

Snapkick is alittle weak but hey your a low level monk using melee not the best of things to use so it's not going to do alot of damage when your just learning it. Next i got circle kick at 13 this was better then snapkick took about 1/3 less to kill a monster. the move is very slowly got better as i got higher, this is a lvl 13 move alittle weak also maybe the dmg could be improved alittle bit to help the little monks get up higher. at lvl 20 which i learnt furrystrike, move sounds cool looks cool and tyste tells me you get another hit in as you get more melee, but it takes nearly twice as long to kill a monster using it compared to circlekick so im thinking the move is alittle weak but it should atleast do more then circle kick?So far ive seen monks are a great class with lots of possibility crushingblow and stuntouch both great moves, furrystrike as you get more melee you get more punches in, all great. But in a nut shell i think the moves just arent doing enough damage. Now im not saying they do no damage because they are usable i suppose. But it would be nice for some of the monk's abilities to do more damage. Otherwise the poor monks are going to have to work 3 times harder sitting at their computers for longer just xping to keep up with their friends who play different classes. Im not saying we have to be equal but improving the moves so we dont have to work soo hard to get decent would be nice.But hey what do i know im only a lvl 20 :P im just saying what i think.
