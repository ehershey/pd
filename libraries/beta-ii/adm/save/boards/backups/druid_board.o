Thornwrack and icestorm just don't cut it past level 40.  When it takes me 7 rounds to kill a knight in Tenebrae with full nature and magic attack means that they are not very powerful.Vinearmour is okay, but nothing special. Plus it costs a boatload of mana.We need some faith based spells.  Maybe peace? We are clergy, after all.  Maybe a healing spell? I'm not asking for cure, maybe just natures purity or some such.Finally, I think we should have summoning powers.Level 20 we can summon a deer, level 30 we can summon a bear, level 40 we can summon a treant (A tree that's alive), level 50 we can summon a Rock GolemBecause we do direct damage to monsters, and with icestorm we attack everything in the same room.  And since we are pared and are not fighters, we have neither the defense nor the constitution to withstand such attacks. Why should I be forced to run through tenebrae because I can not clear out the drow or forbidden forest very fast?In conclusion:1. We need more powerful direct attack spells2.

For some reason they killed the main body of my post. Argh.But to reiterate.  This is how bears should go.It would work sort of like rage.  That is, when the druid would go into bear form, he would attack everyone except his party members, and because he is taken over by primal instincts, he can not stop the battle, run away, cast magic, or do anything but attack until the battle is over.Basically, when the druid goes into bear form.  His Magic Defense is way lowered, he unequips all armor/weapons and attacks using his claws(melee). As such.  Attack and Melee go way up, defense goes up (but not as much as attack or melee) and hp goes up.This would give us a chance against fighters.  Think about it, clerics have para. Monks are already hybrids, Kataan can summon demons.  But what do druids get? They cast thornwrack and hope for the best as they really have limited options here. And because of their low hp and defense they will lose.  We have no opening manuevers like charge or stun.  All we do is walk in and thornwrack (maybe icestorm but thornwrack is better for one on one) And we have to type thornwrack X. We can make an alias, but fighters can just slash.This would also allow us to really act like druids. Even AD&D lets druids turn into animals, and with much less restrictions then what I'm proposing.Also, I see no problems with having a heal command.  Cyclone would be nice, you could make an enemy disappear into a cyclone for x turns and when it's over, he comes back without damage and ready to fight (he will attack when it's over).  Faerie fire would really be helpful. Lowering an enemy units armor would just be such a great help to the weak druids.Later on, if the bear thing takes off, we could add bear attacks.  Where as 'serkers get slash, whirl, ect. Bears could get items like claw slash, bite, rush, ect.Roar would be a great help in party.  As such, all we can do is vinearmour at the moment, wouldn't it be great if we could cast the roar spell and have your allies attack rating raised? Maybe just roar <x> increases base attack by y depending on q, r, and s.I'm not trying to make Druids inhumanly strong uber class.

Never the less I believe I should speak my mind to my druid cohorts on the subject of this class. Hermes you have a lot of cool ideas, But you need to work on them a little further. The bear idea is cool but I would think wolf would be more suitable for a druid. It would be like you transform you lose all your mp and you gain like +20 to str con and dex while in this form, You cannot run or anything but attack the monsters in the room. Your defense and hp would also greatly improve making you an unmoving raged wolf. Only problem I see with that is that it's a little too much like a fighter but anyway.Second of all is a healing spell/ability would make sense for a druid. What if a druid could summon a vine that clings to the druid and links up with trees/nature feeding the life from the trees/nature straight into the druid giving a constant flow of hp every round. Like 50? Not sure about that idea though. I agree with Hermes that druids and fire don't mix well. Nature and ice would be a better combo. Cyclone has a lot of potential.

Yay!",]),(["size":5,"owner":"wildsilk","date":1043142136,"title":"Lala","message":"Huh?",]),(["size":5850,"owner":"hermes","date":1043487310,"title":"Reminder and me complaining","message":"I notice that general whining and bitching gets great results on the fighter board.  So I'm going to try things my way.Here are the facts as I, Druid Hermes greatest of the greats, master of the universe, coolest guy to ever spank a woman, see them.Para:Clerics get them.  Hellll, Clerics get it in SPADES. It's one of their reasons for living.Monks get them, and a good one at that.Fighters get them.  And you know what I have to say about the fairness of fighters in general as it relates to direct combat against a magic user.Assassins do not get them... thank God for that.Some Wanderers get them, but hell that's fine.I think a few mages do... But I'm not certain about that...Even Kataans get them, or a chance to get them and Kataans have more stuff going for them and should be least deserving of them.Druids...err...  Icestorm paras... me. It paras me, sometimes for two rounds over when it hits and other then that I have no para ability.Recommendation: Druids get some sort of para, it wouldn't be that hard.  I'll give a suggestion: Entangle, vines burst from the earth and tangle up the feet of a person.  The para duration is based off of Nature/Faith with a cap at 3-4 rounds.Clerics, Monks, White Dragons, and I *think* fighters get it.Kataans don't get it.  But that is the nature of their beast.What is wrong with Druids getting it? They are a peaceful sect like Clerics and Monks.Spells:As it stands right now, level 50 with max MA, Faith, MD, and Nature with large wisdom and intelligence means that my spells should be doing just fine right?It takes me four thornwracks or four icestorms to kill a Tenebrae knight.  That's just horrible!It takes Shinkoro five rounds using the spell of his choice and he's no where near my level or skill total.I don't know if the formula or Icestorm and Thornwrack is messed up or it simply has some cap on it that's really low, but both spells need to be upgraded to do some good damage or I'm going to stay the only active druid.If you want further proof just look at Tyste.  He was a druid, he talked until he was blue in the face and eventually ended up leaving the Druid subclass for a monk when he became an angel.  I don't think this is a case of, \"How friggen powerful can I be\" as there are better combinations then angel/monk.  This was simply him getting tired of doing little to no damage despite putting everything into it.  I know how he feels.  My one saving grace is I have holyfire...Now, granted, there are some good Druid abilities.Vinearmour is nice. Could be bumped up a little, maybe with my AC suggestion I made but it's nice overall.Wildshape is a friggen godsend.  The HP bonus lets me tank against those really big monsters and the swipe is nice (Thank you for taking it away from dragons).We need a healing spell but Stormy is already working on that.Maybe you could give us Boost? It would make us more ofa partier and since we have Wildshape now it'd be useful to have.Conjuring:Does it have any use?  I have it at 31/300 right now and don't see any reason to raise it.  Ideas:Alright, now let's get down to the meat of it.Most of these are rehashes of what I've talked to Stormy/Nightshade about. But I'm restatting them here:A rogue wildshape.  Like a panther or something.  It would have an attack that does the damage of backstab(Pounce or something) plus the general swipe but here's the cost which realllly balances it.  Besides not wearing any armor, your hp is actually cut by a quarter.  Thus my 1200 hp would reduce to 800.  Sure, this opens up the possiblity of run in, pounce, run out and wildshape back...but if you made it paraed for a few rounds after the pounce then I wouldn't go do this to the drow general or, more importantly, another player and get away scott free (Thus no whining).Another area attack, or buff up Icestorm.  Buff up Thornwrack.  PLEASE make it powerful.  Healing - Which Stormbringer is working on but I'm including for postarity.Peace - Not a huge deal but it'd be nice.  Same with Boost.Para - Needed.  Druids are so underpowered right now it's just ludicrous.And this would be one of the ways to get them up to snuff.Finally:  Fighters/Assassins/RAKNIDSI know you're working on a way to balance Raknid's, Stormy, but we still have quite a bit of balancing problems.Honostly, I would make Raknid a quest race but that's just me.Right now there is an alt of Lucifers, HaraldHardRaade who is currently out to kill me dead.  And he can do it if he buffs up enough.  How? Because he's a fighter raknid and with stun/slash/slash/coup it's game over for me.And this is with very little to no stats, skills, or level.So why shouldn't I go Angel/Cleric to be just as cheap? Because I'm proud of my Druid class and I know that people listen to me because I make good arguments, just like I'm doing right now.I know you have a lot of stuff on your plate right now, Stormy.  I also know that you feel that you get no thanks for the work you do.Believe me, I always appreciate what you do for the simple fact that you took time out of your life to respond to me if nothing else.Same with Nightshade.Wraith is a big booby head, though.I know that it might feel kind of silly, or perhaps biased to work a lot on a subclass that has only one active member in it instead of one with a lot of people in it.  But look at it this way.If you really do a good job in getting Druid up to stuff, then I can guarntee you that people will start to make druid characters, and actually stick with them thus adding to the diversity of the game.We might actually see something besides, gasp, assassins and raknid fighters!Anyway, eventually I'm going to make the ultimate scout but that's in the future.Thanks for listening to me, have a pleasant day.-HermesPeace:",]),(["size":20,"owner":"aximili","date":1044301062,"title":"RE 63","message":"I agree with hermes",]),(["size":910,"owner":"archeon","date":1044360333,"title":"Hermes","message":"This is not a complete post but just stating some thoughts from hermes ramblingsNO PARA!!!!!!There should be other ways to up druids without para and they should be persued.
