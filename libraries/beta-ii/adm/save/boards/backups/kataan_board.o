You said to post on class balance and what we thought. So here are a couple notes about Kataans from my experience.Main spells are hellfire and demonfire. Always are even at high levels when vortex is available. Both hellfire and demonfire are fine. Hellfire is much weaker than other classes area attacks (a lvl 25 wizard's acid cone does as much as my hellfire), but its still fine for exping. Demonfire is also fine. It stuns me for 1-2 rounds and does about 25% more than hellfire but it has a 1 round para which helps some. its fine by me.We get a few other things tho that are weak by comparrison. Here goes:Dakzhul: This is near useless after the first few levels you get it. There seems to be no way to raise its damage much. Murder is insanely expensive so if thats what its based on then its not really possible to raise it. As is my dakzhul does around 120 in arena which is about the same it has done since i was lvl 30. If this could be based off of protectile for damage it would be nice (plus it would require people to raise projectile which isnt nessissary right now).Summon: New summons sure would be nice. Even if we just got the necromancer ones. Assassin is still my best summon and i've had that since lvl 14. I never use summons.Vortex: Watch everyone in the world whine at me and say mine does too much... But yuou know what? It paralyzes me for 3 rounds. It also does only 2x the damage of hellfire exactly meaning that i can do much more damage by using a my lvl 20 hellfire than i can by vortex. Compare it to an angel's holyfire and it does less damage per hit and can be cast much less often (holyfire has an initial 1 round delay and then can hit every round). Compare to other area attacks and its pretty pathetic. And it costs 120 mp per mob too... I constantly have to wait on mp. Balancing vortex... it sure could use an increase in damage especially considering magic defense is a big factor in reducing damage. as it is, I take 5 rounds to kill a 25k mob with vortex. My lvl 20 alt kills a 25k mob in 3 rounds and doesnt get an exp cut for it. Upping vortex damage and making the mp cost higher (so i cant just vortex the throne room all day) would make it balanced. More downtime for more damage.As is Kataans are decent. Very fun class to play. But when it comes to exping power they run a little short.",]),(["title":"rubicant","size":2253,"date":1043269152,"owner":"wildflower","message":"vortex use to be a really kick ass spell, till a certain fighter on phase one made me hurry up and level to 50 to test it out on him.  I've never used the spell before, but we went to the arena and one vortex brutilized him.  He whine and complained and vortex turned to be a wis attack spell instead of int (expensive for kataans)  but anyhoo, with all this being said, I must add, he only had 10 wis.  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO you do the math on that one.Dakzhul was only added cause for kattaan on phase one you got hellfire at 20, and vortex at level 50.  I sugguested an ability in between.  I can not tell you what dakzhul is based off of, but I can tell you it takes more then one skill and more then one stat to make it strong.  On phase one I was able to match faust's backstab when he was a rogue.  SOOOOOOOOOOOO, that means you gotta play around with your skills and stats and check it every now and then.  The fact that I had to beg Asmodeus and Stormbringer for this ability, is prolly why it seems so useless at first.  Now I don't know what changes if any on phase 2 has effected any of the damage % of this ability.  I stopped playing when hellfire was changed to ONLY an area effect spell and no one told me till I died three times in a row using it.  Partly my fault the third time I died, I decided to scroll up at that time to see what the hell was going on.Now, summons, summons was added only to enhance the kattaan roll playing.  I never dreamed that people would use it as a way to xp, but since everyone here is looking for easy way out, consider yourself lucky.  The summon list was never suppose to exist.  I'm really proud that people are now playing kattaans.  On phase 1 I was the only one for just about the entire phase 1 history.  But if you want changes, I found that if you do your homework, and create things that you feel is kattaan like, mail stormbringer the spell/ability, what it does, the messages that appears to everyone within the room, the idea actully gets put into the game.  loopsAnyhooo, I thought maybe a little bit of history background would explain why things are left the way they are, also I just realized I been putting two many t's in the word kataans....wildflower, the first kataan",]),(["title":"Rubicante","size":614,"date":1043281169,"owner":"spawn","message":"Dude, not to contridict you but cause you know I really respect you as a player, but your comparing holyfire to vortex....vortex is a mortal spell while holyfire is actually a angel spell...now if there were no angels/demons then holyfire would not exist making vortex the most powerful spell in the game. Now to be truthful I don't see the fault lying in vortex. I see the fault in being that angels are over powered.

StuffDakzhul. I dont believe skills have an effect on this or stats to any significant extent. i raised each of my skills by 10 today and checked dakzhul damage and none of them improved it. It might be effected by faith/ma/summoning since i keep those maxxed all the time, but if that is true then with 420 in main skills (lvl 70 max) dakzhul does around 150 damage to players.Vortex. Here are the stats and comarrisons of vortex.Vortex. 3 round spell. Cast and it paras me for 2 rounds. Thus other classes can cast 3 times before i am unparad. Vortex damage is a bit over 400. We'll call it 430 because its less vs players with high md.Vs Gromph (lvl 50 wizard with low stats). He does 320 per acidcone. Cast 3 times before i unpara from vortex this makes 960 damage vs my 430.Vs Mathiu (lvl 30ish sorc with low stats). He does 150 per psistorm. This adds up to 450 vs my 430.Vs Hermes (lvl 50 angel with moderate stats) he does 330 on holyfire. 1 round delay to start means he does 660 damage vs my 430.My skills are 120 points higher than a lvl 50s. My skills are 200 points higher than a level 37's. My stats are at least double all players named if not much more. My level is 70.Notice the difference in damages there? A level 25 wizard can outdamage me and he doesnt get exp cuts. I take 5 rounds to kill a 25k mob.I like the idea of vortex as being a big damage spell that paras you for awhile, but as is the damage is very low and we're weak in comparrison. A 35% damage upgrade would still leave me short of doing damage equal to other classes but i feal this would be fair as i get other useful abilities such as buffer.As for angels being a quest race. Yes they are quest race.... however notice i am a demon. I do 150 damage with massacre (i have lvl 50 fighter stats/skills that effect massacre). This paras me for 2 rounds. That is 75 damage a round to a single target vs 330 to all targets per round for angels. Ya angels are too strong. Whatever. Demons get more women. But its not just that holyfire is much better, all area attacks are superior to our vortex.

Our demonfire paras 40% of time and does significantly less damage than a spell/attack of a class the same size. This idea would help kataans further with balancing and with broadening their choices for matters of exping.My idea works around summons. At the moment our last summon (assassin) is at lvl 14. With 6 summoning a lvl i would assume its a main skill to be able to summon things. Also when you summon a creature that rules out area attacks (hellfire/vortex) for exping. Thus summons will be kept in check as you can only use them in conjunction with demonfire or with impale+normal rounds.Summons (some changes made to set balance)Nightmare (lvl 4)Imp (lvl 7)Messenger (lvl 10)Carrier (lvl 15)Assassin (lvl 20)Those are the current summons and levels i would recommend them being at (assassin is strong for lvl 14)New summons:Lvl 30:Less Khaloi Demon   Lvl 17   Raknid    spells: solidifyLevel 40Greater Khaloi Demon   Lvl 23   Gore    TripAt level 50 a kataan is then able to summon Demon MastersA demon master can be one of 4 different classes chosen by the kataan (IE: Summon demon fighter master, summon demon mage master, ect).  The demon master's strength would be based off of the player's strength. Thus a larger player would summon a more powerful demon. There are 4 choices (fighter, rogue, mage, clergy). Here is what each would beDemon fight master:   Level = 1/2 player's level   If player's str > 50   then the demon gets the whirl ability    If player's str is > 75 then demon gets the rush ability    str > 100 = massacre   str > 150 = hack    raknidDemon mage master:   level = player's level/2   int > 50 = scorch   int > 75 = annihilate   int > 100 = acidcone   int > 150 = energyboltDemon rogue master:   lvl = player's level /2   dex > 50 = stab   dex > 75 = gore   dex > 100 = circle   Dex > 150 = backstabDemon clergy master:   Lvl = player's lvl /2   wis > 50 = lifetap   wis > 75 cure self   wis > 100 = lifewarp   wis > 150 = paralyzeThe demons would use their abilities/spells at random like any other mob. Thus they would use normal attacks about 50% of the time, and every 2 rounds or so would use an ability they had (randomly chosen ability if more than 1 is available).I dunno if this would seem too strong. Remember a lvl 25 mob (which a lvl 50 demon would summon) only has 1.1k hp. That would die fast. For a decent summon the player would have to have both high level and very high stats. This would keep it in balance.
