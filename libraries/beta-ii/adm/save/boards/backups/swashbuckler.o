Tarent did 60 per hit at lvl 37 to me which is very very little compared to what any other class can do.2) Make flash do more damage to start combat (as in damage of a 5 hit bladedance which would be about 200 at lvl 21). 3) area attack like tarent suggested. Or some ability along the lines of rage but not quite that. It could be \"Swordsmanship\" or something like that (i suck at names). It would give us extra normal attacks and would raise our bladedance number of hits by one. Would last 3 rounds and would take 50 sp or so.
