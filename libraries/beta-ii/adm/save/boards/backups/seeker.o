It assumes you know at least what copyright is -- basically the legal exclusive right of the author of a creative work to control the copying of that work. If you didn't know that, check out my own brief introduction to copyright for more information. Feel free to link to this document, no need to ask me. Really, NO need to ask. 1) \"If it doesn't have a copyright notice, it's not copyrighted.\" This was true in the past, but today almost all major nations follow the Berne copyright convention. For example, in the USA, almost everything created privately and originally after April 1, 1989 is copyrighted and protected whether it has a notice or not. The default you should assume for other people's works is that they are copyrighted and may not be copied unless you know otherwise. There are some old works that lost protection without notice, but frankly you should not risk it unless you know for sure.  ","size":1167,]),(["date":1010828837,"title":"Stuff","owner":"whit","message":"Put that file in /d/guilds/examples.c  Thanks alot man for that piece of code but my mom is being a meanie and making me go to bed.
