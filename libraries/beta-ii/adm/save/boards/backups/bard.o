I made it to lvl 18!I can't believe I got this far. If anyone actually reads this board, I can tell you. Being a bard is hard. You get almost no new songs as you progress up the lvl ladder. And each new song seems somewhat worse then the last. The latest new song I have increases my attack slightly.... it takes longer to sing the song, then it lasts.... I actually timed it. It took over 10 seconds to sing the song, and the skill buff lasted about 8 seconds. I can make about 400k an hour if I xp like crazy. and I get to fight all the fun little things. I wont get into trip..... thats another story. I would really like to see some new songs, that do something.... and maybe last longer then they take to sing. I would also like to see some serious reduction in the cost of skills, since I think that having REALLY lousy attack songs, and having REALLY lousy attack skills makes for a REALLY lously class that can't defend itself.

I think that covers everything I can think of at the moment.","size":1012,]),(["title":"Songs","owner":"daos","date":1045033010,"size":62,"message":"A song has been taken out of the game until it can be redone.",]),})
