Our guild is based on role-playing the evilness of the dark side.1. role-playing - Refer to the help files of your Race, Sub-class, and Guild.  In these help files it gives you the base information of what defines you.  For example: Saurans- Have no sense of humor- Kataans -Summons demons- Unholy -Kills all Angels- : Role-playing is greatly encouraged, and will be awarded accordingly. 2. respect- No one in this guild is expected to give you stuff, and or money.  Your leaders will not be happy if in house fighting occurs over this.  Also, respect our treaty alliances, more about that later.3. punishmets- Will be between Leviathas and myself and the person being punished.  When we can not come up with an appropriate punishment or the action being punished isn't listed will be put up to a vote of the Unholy Guild.a. - Anyone associating with Angels on good terms (severe punishment)b. - Anyone going saintly (accidently or otherwise) (severe punishment)c. - Anybody contributing to an in house battle (depends on arguement)d. - Anyone killing members of other guilds in our treaties (not looking good)4. Treaties- We have aligned with Darksouls and Forsaken, If you want to know more about this, talk to Leviathas or myself.5. P.K.- Yes pk-ing (when legal) is allowed.  All angels die, no questions asked (If you can) We don't expect level 20's killing angels, but when a war breaks out we expect you to try.  We don't accept contracts to kill for outsiders, but will consider it on a case to case bases.  Reason for this and please READ carefully.  Every time you decide to p.k. you MUST ask permission from Leviathas or myself, this will ensure guild backup if something should go wrong. If you decide NOT to, you are out on your own.  If per-chance that both Leviathas or myself are not on, and five or more guild members on on, it can be either put up for a vote, or you can wait till we are on.a.- If you decide if pk is the answer, please ask yourself if it fits the role-playing of your char. and that it benifits you and or the guild greatly.  Keep in mind, killing anyone in Darksouls and Forsaken is a major NO!  So keep up to date on player profiles, they tend to change from day to day.6. Guild Funds - All deposits of the Guild Funds will be used only for Guild related stuff.  Leviathas wants to expand the guild quickly as we can.  The faster we can build our guild, the faster we get our guild freebies.  We have some ideas on hand, and welcome any ideas, but the catch....mud mail it to us, it is not up for debate.  How-ever, when we have enough, we will at times will vote on which room to go up first.  The rooms are very costly, so we want to benifit the guild as a whole in the begining, not individual classes.  7. Leaving the guild - If for some reason this guild is not working out for you, or if it became your punishment, be aware you made yourself open season for any Unholy guild member go pk you.Okay, now that you know what is expected of you, have a great time!  We want you to continue your mudding experience.  If you have any questions ask Leviathas or myself (Wildflower) we will be happy to answer them.

My journey took me far beneath the surface, far enough where the Gods themselves thought I dead and removed my existance from this world.  It is there, where I found a piece of Asmodeus' soul.  It took me several months of enchantments to revive this soul, in fact it almost cost me my life.  I have seen things I've never dreamed of seeing.  I've seen power beyond power.  It's made me thirsty for power beyond my own.
