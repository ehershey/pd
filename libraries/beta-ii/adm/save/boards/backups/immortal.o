Noticed a bunch on the AC change posted here so just though i'd put it in from a recent ex-players experience.I think it should be taken out. It makes it so anyone can reduce abilities to 0. I took 0 damage from all abilities just about after the AC change using buffer, invoke sphere (vorticon item), and ruby amulets. Lac's slash and Wraith's stab both did 0 damage for example.The problem is that the AC change downgrades damage people do, but only downgrades. THere is no bonuses for slashing, ect people with no armor. Thus it effectively is a nerf to all abilities. A big one at that, especially in PvP. Its a good idea, but it really limits ability based classes and throws off their balance vs magic users for exp and vs players in PvP.","size":756,"owner":"rubicante",]),(["title":"48","date":1045717325,"message":"K.
