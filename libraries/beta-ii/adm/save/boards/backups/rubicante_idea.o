The EXP component and the PvP component. People will complain about both. IE so and so kills faster than me. Or so and so kills me in arena too easily.In each part there are different things that create power.The EXPing component.The speed of exping is determined by a few things:1) Speed at killing a single monster2) Area attacks and their damage3) Downtime to recover SP or MP.These 3 components determine how fast you can exp. A person who can do a lot of damage to a single mob will make good exp in areas without exp cuts (IE roston/temple for a lvl 50). A person with good area attacks will kill extreemly fast in areas with exp cuts (IE lvl 50 in sewers/lodos/merk). The people who have the least downtime make much more exp with continous killing.The biggest single factor really ends up being area attacks. Killing many small mobs doesnt require downtime because mp regenerates almost instantly and small mobs do little damage. So area attacks are a huge advantage for exping.The PvP component.This component consists of a few different things1) Ability to damage a single target2) Ability to stun3) Ability to lower/resist damage.PvP is very very different from EXPing. Downtime doesnt matter because you put all your sp/mp on the line for a quick kill. A person who can do a lot of damage will kill the other faster and win. Stuns pervent the other player from hitting back, running, or healing. And being able to lower damage or take a lot of it (Con, defense, MD) allows a player to be very hard to kill which gives them more time to heal/attack.The biggest single thing in PvP is ability to stun. If you cant move you die very fast and have no chance to heal or run.I'll be using this system as a template to describe the current classes and their strengths, weaknesses, and balance","owner":"rubicante","title":"19",]),(["date":1045695107,"message":"EXP component:Speed at killing a single target:   At lower levels this isnt terribly fast, and is done through demonfire.

At high levels vortex is one of the most damaging single target spells in the game.2) Very good. Demonfire is currently a permanent stun.Ability to resist/lower damage:   Very Low. 4 defense per level and 1.5 md dont really help low damage. Con is also very costly for a kataan.

The easiest way to show this is for me to show to the HPs of mobs at certain levels and you can then assume what levels should kill what exp mobs and how fast.  A good thing to keep in mind is that if you can insta-kill 25k mobs with an exp cut, you will make around 30 mil an hour. If you can kill them with an area attack you will make near 60 mil.

How do I know? Type \"who\". See all these raknids? Hmm... maybe there is a reason that all non-quest race ability based classes choose raknid. Now lets do some math...A raknid is powerful because of 4 arms. Thus 2 more normal attacks. At low levels this is a 100% damage increase. at level 50 this is a 40% damage increase for normal attacks. Thats a good ammount of the normal damage of a rogue/fighter/wanderer (stab/slash/cut).It also allows for 3rd and 4th hits on slash/cut/stab.   Thus an increase of we'll say 50% damage (its random so not a full 100% increase). This is a HUGE damage increase from being a raknid. Now you have the increased sp costs which balance out that damage. Stronger abilities cause more downtime to get sp back. This is a good and balanced.Raknids take slightly more damage. Not a lot more. Slightly. I have had many elite raknids. I know.  This slight increase in damage balances out the inrease in normal attacks.Now here is where the problem comes in. Some classes dont suffer the increased downtime for sp regeneration. Thus they get a 50% increase in ability damage for free. These classes are the paladin and antipaladin who can boost.  This is clearly overpowered (they are as strong 1.7 normal races with no drawbacks except taking slightly more damage).Now we get to berzerkers. Everyone says rubicante shut up. They are already balanced. Well you know what? they're not. They are just as bad as paladins/antipaladins. This is because of rage. Here is how it works.Rage takes 20 sp to perform. Once you are raged your sp goes to 100 and never drops below and thus you can use abilities for as long as you are in rage. You also get a big attack boost which causes more normal attacks and increases the damage of attack based abilities (slash).What does this mean for a raknid? It means you rage in a room with a few mobs thus attacking them all. You will get slashes for esentially no sp cost. The slash will go off once every 4 rounds we'll say (it goes off more for me but i'm being conservative). Each slash is increased in damage by a very large margin because of the attack boost. For example a level 50 fighter in rage with 60s in slash will quad slash for over 1.4k damage. Now every 4 rounds you get a slash for no sp. Thats enourmous damage for no downtime (use one ointment and rage again).A zerk's rage is a VERY strong ability with just melee. It is only kept balanced by its high risk. When you add in slash it is way too strong. Slash needs to be removed from these 3 classes to balance raknids along with these classes","size":2631,"owner":"rubicante","title":"Raknid problem",]),(["date":1045786057,"message":"In general area attacks are the strongest exping spells in the game.

A 2 round delay makes charge useless as higher levels when 2 slashes and normal attacks would do more. HOwever centaur charge is only 1 round so esentially it is a backstab for fighters.Furthermore Charge is very stat based. Str*3 and Dex*4 are part of the formula. That can add up to a lot of damage for adding stats (more so than any other ability except quad cut, and bladedance). The balance comes out to where charge is as strong as backstab given the same level and stats.Now a Fighter's charge takes much more sp than a backstab. Which of course is good for balance.

There is also more downtime vs the 60k mobs because you need to heal hp in addition to sp/mp.   Then take into account area attacks. Vortex insta-kills and does holyfire for example. Thus you get around 332k vs 60k.    This further shows the huge power of area attacks.I suggest that when a person is twice the level of a mob that they lose 3/4 of the exp from it. ","size":757,"title":"Exp cuts","owner":"rubicante",]),(["date":1046158727,"message":"K. Smite is a little bit insane. Coupedegrace and the monk version are both fine but smite is nuts...Here's why.Check the code.   It includes Faith*3    Thats a LARGE number to add into the formula. It also adds attackEssentially it is coupedegrace minus the Dex component and adding a HUGE faith component. Example:A lvl 75 using coupedegrace can insta-kill something with 1000 hp left. The same level and stats using smite you can insta-kill something with 1600 hp (Assuming 100 dex).Granted the alignment changes this a little... but most mobs have 0 alignment and even with highly positive alignment you can insta-kill most anything with smite alone. Dont even get me started on a centaur charge + smite (it'll insta-kill something with 4-5k life).Smite's formula should be modified to be just faith instead of Faith*3     This will make it stronger than coupe or the monk version.
