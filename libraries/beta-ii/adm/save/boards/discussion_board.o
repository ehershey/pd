Anyone wishing todiscuss a different locale should post it here and post why they think itshould be hosted there. I am choosing Dallas, Tx because it is close to beingcentral US meaning the furthest any one would have to travel from the east orwest coast would be about equal. Also, Dallas is a large city with many thingsto do. We are hoping to plan for it to be during may-june. May would beprefereable since it is cooler then, though early June is still nice weather.Please post your thoughts, comments, or ideas.

Is this in 07 cause i better start saving.  We could have it in the middle of the pacific ocean cause then that is mroe central for me coming from aus.

Hell I don't even trust myself at times, I forget half the time.  That is why I'm so happy there is a seperate board for this :)  Any hoo, while we are at it, I would like some ideas for the party, dates would be nice, food, entertainment, etc.  My goal is to get as much of this underway so that you guys have a good two years to save up money.  I don't think we'll collect dues for certain events, we'll just let you know how much things are, and you can pick and choose what you like to do...I don't know.....All I know that this would be a great opportunity to get to meet people face to face, I only know you by your char, so if you play a centaur, well guess what, I will alway picture you with four legs and galloping across the fields with long flowing hair...oh getting side tracked.

I do agree with Hep about the May-June thing. I will be in school during those times and could not possibly skip it for that :(. I'm a senior and this year's gotta count.

The reason is, a lot of people live on the east, and a lot live on the west.  It seems most fair to be somewhere in the middle.  That way it's less money for those on the west (if it's in the east) and less money for those on the east (if it were in the west).

Having a little one (2 months or so) in the heat of Texas is not my idea of fun.  Having it the next year would be very good.  Also by then the two oldest wlll be grown and they can deicde on their own if they want to go.  I know May-June is a hard time for those in school, but you should consider at least June instead of July or August since the temperatures in Texas normally go into the triple digits during the time of year and I know most of us that are here on a regular basis do not like the heat since we are sitting under the air conditioner typing at a terminal.  I will help stormy with any reservations cause believe me if there is a good deal out there I will find it.  Of course it would have to be much closer to the date before I can get a final price, but at least we can get a estimate before hand.And I doubt I will dress up cause I am not sure that I could pull off a dragon in the heat ;)",]),(["size":224,"date":1154995362,"title":"costumes","owner":"hepualahaole","message":"I was thinking about that...maybe the dragons can have something represent thier char...like a drawing or something....so you can choose either waycause I'm not dressing up as a dragon either...you got to be kidding!hepl",]),(["size":867,"date":1155001786,"title":"Re: Party Plans","owner":"bellos","message":"Ok...Well I agree that Dallas would likely be the best place for all the same reasons already stated...Even though thats one heck of a trek for me...(Bein from Alberta and all...)But anyway...

I actually drove to a mud-friends gettogether way back in may of 1997 in dayton, OH  (Yeah, I'm that old :D).  Dayton was chosen because the mud was based out of Wright State (in Dayton), and we had a lot of people within about 5 hrs driving distance of there.
