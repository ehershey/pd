Clerics are no good at soloing at higher levels. We HAVE to support to get xp. Which is fine if you have other players around your level. However, the higher you go, the less players around your level to xp with, and therefore, less oppertunity to party and 'support'. -- Archprelate Tsuke.",]),(["size":3124,"title":"cleric idea.","date":1152037782,"owner":"tsuke","message":"ok, i know i posted this as a mudidea, but that was like a year and a half ago, and i didn't hear anything about it then :P so i thought i might put it here for all clerics to see, and comment on, and the admin's/immortals as well. :)Ok, this is my idea for a cleric level 50 spell/ability since they don't have any at all. I personally don't think it'll affect balance all that much but that is up to you (imm/admins) to decide.Ok, the basic idea is an aura type thing. I'm not sure if this can be coded but if it can, i think that it'll really help the struggling cleric class without overpowering them because i don't want clerics to become hackless. My reasoning for not wanting clerics to become hackless is simple, i don't want the MUD to become overrun with clerics, as i feel that this would make the game boring. Anyway, back to the idea description :POkay,the first item that i'll cover is what the aura does. It Randomly Heals the cleric and/or deals damage to creatures/players that are in combat with the cleric, this could be seen as the diety watching over its devout cleric. Also while the aura is active, it should be possible for the cleric to cast spells of it's own. I was thinking that the chance for each the healing special or the dmg special should be no more the 20-25% per combat round or heartbeat (which ever is deemed appropriate (or are they the same thing :o)), but make it possible for both to happen at the same time. Now how much should the healing and the damage be? well i've put quite a bit of thought into this and have come up with what i personally think would be balanced, although it may not be, im not sure. What i have come up with is this, the healing should do ~1/3 of maximum cure for thier level, so at level 50 it would be ~167. For the damage aspect i was thinking of working it as ((Faith + Belief + wisdom)/4), the reason i don't think magic attack should be used it because the damage is divine, and not from the actual caster. If there are any questions in this area, please, do not hesitate to ask.Now casting time, how much mp, etc. Casting time and duration should be dependant on faith, so for example a level 50 player with 300 faith would have a aura duration of 300 heartbeats (10 miniutes) however, it should have a casting time of faith divided by 5 seconds (or faith divided by 2.5 heartbeats (can that even be done?)) (so for level 50 with 300 faith it would take 60 seconds to cast and goes up by 1.2 seconds per level) now this is a long casting time and by level 100 (if any cleric ever got that high :P) it would take 2 minutes to cast, but last for 20 minutes. now in this time i think it would be really neat if there were little messages that the player got as they cast the spell (of them praying or somthing). Also casting should paralize the player, and cost all the casters mp, and their mp should stay at 0 mp for the duration of the casting as the cleric is devoting all of their energy to praying to their god. An upkeep for the Aura may not be a bad idea, somthing like 100 mp every 10 heartbeats or somthing.  -- Archprelate Tsuke.",]),(["size":453,"title":"clerics","date":1153125124,"owner":"nulvect","message":"So, I'd like to make your paralyze decent, make turn and resurrect useful,take out some of the redundant attack spells and replace them with one or twodamage over time spells (but keep, say, wound/pain/lifewarp), add a couplemore defensive spells and some more healing spells, maybe a party-memberwide buffer or boost or cure... or all of the above.Also I have a timed healing spell about halfway ready for you guys.Any comments or suggestions??",]),(["size":98,"title":"clerics","date":1153129028,"owner":"nekor","message":"I really like lifetap because it gives ups life as well as doing damage. but hey that' sjust me.",]),(["size":1259,"title":"comments","date":1153240753,"owner":"tsuke","message":"ok, i think i'll just list these out in order.paralyze, omg if you make this useful, i will worship you. or at least thank you :P.turn, will only ever be useful if there is more undead in the game.

At higher levels, this starts to change. At level 50 (with no new abilities to my knowledge) a cleric can cure, with max healing 500hp, a fair chunk in anyone's books, combined with boost still, this makes for a most potent support class, and at level 50, there are still players that xp and would happily accept a cleric supporter (at least, there used to be, not sure in the current playerbase :P). Players on this game tend to stick around the level 50 mark though, and while this is all well and good, it makes it a bit harder for the cleric to start advancing in levels again, since a clerics healing skills only go up with level, it makes it adventageous for a cleric to advance in level,instead of say, getting 300 wis (although that'd be cool too).At level 56+ we find that a cleric has moved out of party range of the players sitting on level 50 and unless the cleric was advancing with a group of friend, finds his party base deminished greatly. Once a cleric hits 60, chances are that there is next to no players to party with, or who want to party with a cleric (since there stats are probably good, and having a cleric in the party would most likly slow down xping. So, chances are that by the time a cleric hits level 60, they were be mostly, if not exclusivly, solo xping, without any decent dmg dealing capabilities.The Moral of this story, either stop advancing at 50 (or mid 30's if you want) so that you have a player base to party with. Or be willing to put in alot of extra hours soloing.  -- Archprelate Tsuke.",]),(["size":335,"title":"Unknit","date":1159233660,"owner":"geddoe","message":"i like itwound - major alignment screwer-upper, but thats reasonable seeing as how you hurt them, but wow every time i casted it, my alignment went down a notchmheal - onyl thing i see is that it was turned to white, but im sure theres another differencepain - also better, as far as i saw it didnt lower alignment so thats good",]),(["size":358,"title":"spells","date":1159235696,"owner":"geddoe","message":"replace is bugged, when i try to restore a body part, it think i need anothe rbody part first, so it says Clyde needs a 0 for that libm to be restored, im guessing 0 is supposed to be a limb, but theres no othe rlimb missing so i cant replace anythingwhen you dont have enough mp to boost, it says You are busy. instead of you dont have enough mp for that",]),(["size":298,"title":"clerics","date":1159235851,"owner":"geddoe","message":"i thought it would be a cool idea for there to beed good and evil clericssince all of our good attack spells cause our alignment to go down, the abilities you get are based off your alignment, healing skill (or destruction for evil cleric), or somethin elsejust thought that would be kinda cool",]),(["size":127,"title":"another one","date":1159236663,"owner":"geddoe","message":"i cast cure on myself, and the next round i try to use unknit, and it says im too busy, but i can cast cure again or boost etc",]),(["size":1529,"title":"responses","date":1159292503,"owner":"nulvect","message":"Since I rarely see any of you guys on, I wanted to let you knowthat I am listening to you.
