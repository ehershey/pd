The quivering body slumped lifelessly to the cold dirt floor.\"Nice, Kilir,\" yelled Piehl, Kilir’s most trusted friend, and the only other wielder of the long lost Balduvian Daggers.Piehl threw his own kill to the side effortlessly, a sign of his intense and extensive training. Although you wouldn’t think this 5’6\" demon would be capable of much strength, the ones who assume this usually don’t live much longer. But Kilir is the only one who truly knows Piehl’s strength, as he has known Piehl since his first day I nthe realm.\"I think that’s the lst of them,\" Kilir said, sheathing his daggers, while keeping his hand on the hilts.\"There will be more, as soon as this group doesn’t report back. We’d better head back to Tirun, I’m a bit tired,\" Piehl stated, without any sign of being tired.Kilir knew Piehl could have kept going for hours, but he appreciated him giving him the chance to rest a bit.\"Sure thing. I should get these cleaned and sharpened anyways, they got a lot of use,\" Kilir said, nudging his daggers.Piehl grinned and stated, \"I counted 53 kills on my part.\"\"21...,\"Kilir stated glumly.\"HRROOOAAARRR!!\" A black dragon burst through the clouds to the east, lightning shooting out of its mouth and nostrils.\"Woops, looks like we made too much noise. Orcha’s done woke up,\" Piehl said, \"I suppose its good…he might scare Vyce’s guys off of us. We should get going.\"--\"Flowers! Fresh flowers!\" Rejik the Peddler yelled out to everybody in the area. Most of the people tried to avoid Rejik, not just because he smelled a bit funny, but because of his usual inventory. One wouldn’t assume just by looking, but Rejik had quite the elaborate setup of weapons, something frowned upon by the town guards.Kilir bumped past Rejik on his was into Tirun, delivering a quick but painful shot to the back of Rejik’s head. Rejik’s hand returned to his own pocket.The path into Tirun wasn’t heavily guarded, despite it being one of the last safe havens for people. Tirun happened to be one of the more popular hangouts for some of the realms more powerful adventurers. Not even Orcha would dare attack Tirun without at least a small army backing him up.Piehl followed Kilir into a random alleyway. They walked for a couple minutes, then turned suddenly to the right, into what seemed like a wall. The seemingly solid stone dissipated from view as the assassins walked through.Flames suddenly erupted into view in front of them. Unphased, Kilir reached into his pocket and raised an emerald ring. He touched the tip of the emerald to the wall of flames. The flames surged violently, then dispersed.\"About time you guys got back! Jynt is getting annoying…he keeps setting things on fire!\" Yang exclaims.A young but powerful mage giggles in the corner, his hands and hair ablaze with red-hot flames. The small elvish pyromancer was the most trecent addition to the Forsaken guild. He was young, but his unparalleled ability with flames made him a prime choice to join the force.\"I can’t help it, it’s been like 5 hours and I’m so bored. Besides, you guys still haven’t told me anything about what’s going on. You guys ARE planning something right?\" Jynteral says, nudging Yang in the shoulder.Yang grimaced, but didn’t budge in the least as Jynteral touched his shoulder with his enflamed hands. If it had been an random person, Yang most likely would have grabbed one of his four weapons lying next to him with one of his four arms and cut the hand off. Though with another four legs, balance is easy to maintain. The raknid blade master shrugged the pain away. Jynt seemed to notice the look and his smile faded a little, and he backed up.\"I suppose now is as good of time as an to let you in on the plan,\" Kilir stated, \"you know the whole deal with Vyce and Gromph, right?\" Kilir asks.\"Yeah, they’ve been fighting for a couple weeks now. I heard Vyce took over Tenebrae and Gromph took over Roston. It sucks that they chose those spots, cause we are stuck right in the middle.\" Jynteral says.\"Correct. The plan, in a nutshell, is to kill them both.\" Kilir stated calmly.\"What?!?! How do you plan on killing the two strongest warlords in the realm? Especially that they both have their own armies. Vyce with his netherman minions, and Gromph raising his own army from the dead. Necromancers aren’t the easiest things to kill…\"\"We aren’t going to take them both on at once. We plan to go after Vyce first, his minions don’t come back once you kill them. With all of us going after him at once, we shouldn’t have too much trouble overpowering him.\"Well how are we going to get to Vyce? Tenebrae is surrounded by water on all sides.\"\"The front gate of course. More kills that way,\" Piehl says with a grin.\"That’s suicide, the archers will kill us before we make it to the castle steps,\" Jynteral exclaims.\"Not with you there they wont,\" Kilir states, \"you will create a wall of fire around us while we go in. Their wooden arrows won’t make it through to us. After that, you and Yang will hold off the nethermen while me and Piehl go to confront Vyce. Then it will be Gromph’s turn. There is a book in the Tenebrae library giving the coordinates for a Roston portal. You will have to memorize it and gate us there.\"Jynteral, looking a bit worried, says, \"Alright then. I suppose I’m onboard.\"Good, \"Kilir states, as if he were giving Jynteral a choice in the matter, \"we will leave at nightfall. It should only take a couple seconds to get there, or some sort of line.\"--Tenebrae. The city of light. Not a very suiting place for an anti-paladin warlord, but the best base strategically to battle a necromancer. The natural light coming from the elven architecture was enough to keep the lesser undead at bay, even during night.The four Forsaken members were about 60 yards away from the front gate. Hidden down in the brush, two demons, a raknid, and an elf plan their attack on the city.\"On my signal, we will run towards the gate. Jynt, when we get about halfway there, I need you to summon the wall of flames to surround us at least 15 meters wide, and tall enough to stop any well-aimed arrows.\" Kilir explains.\"Got it!\" Jynt gives a thumbs up to Kilir\"Ready when you are.\" Yang says, tightening the grip on his four weapons, and bracing each of his 4 legs to charge forward.\"3...2...1...NOW!\" Kilir yells, leaping out of the brush with Piehl right behind Yang, both of the demons hiding in the massive shadow of the raknid.As the four ran towards the gate, a heavy alarm started, alerting the entire city to the presence of danger. The pyromancer said a couple of words under his breath, and an enormous wall of flames surrounded them. Hundreds of arrows flew at them, but disintegrated the second they hit the searing flames.They reached the gate, and Yang rushed forward with two massive shoulders into the gate, breaking it open. Kilir and Piehl ran to the side as the gate flew forward, using the distraction as a sign to cloak themselves in the nearest shadow. Fireballs flew in every which direction, striking down multiple nethermen with each hit. The raknid swung his blades with extreme force and experience, hacking limbs off of the puny minions left and right. The two demons slid into the castle doors without any trouble as the other two kept the attention of every enemy in the area.Inside of the throne room, a panting netherman rushed inside and threw himself in front of the throne. \"My Lord! 2 intruders have breached the main gate! They are in the courtyard, ripping our forces apart!\"\"2 intruders?\" Vyce inquires, \"you are having trouble getting rid of two measly intruders? You sicken me…I suppose I will have to deal with this myself.\"\"Yes…Thank you Lor…\"THUMP…THUmp…Thump….splat.The netherman’s sentence was cut short as he was…cut short. The head bounced a couple times before coming to a stop.Vyce sheathes his black sword and continues toward the door. He stopped a step away from the exit and listened carefully. His sword came out faster than Kilir expected it to as Vyce blocked the back of his neck with the tip of his blade.Kilir leapt back as Vyce’s second blade swung inches from his chest. Kilir flexed his powerful legs to ready another leap as Vyce grinned and said, \"Haha, I see we have more guests. Do you have a particular clichéd comment or should I say my own? Alright then, how would you like to die?\" Vyce rushed forward, blades drawn, at Kilir.The two exchanged blow after blow, both showing great skill and stamina, but Vyce was slowly wearing Kilir back. After a couple more blows, Vyce reared back and struck a mighty blow. Kilir blocked with his daggers, but he was thrown back against the wall. Vyce jumped after him, and attempted a coupe de grace.SLICE!!Two daggers slide quickly in and out of Vyce’s back and neck.Vyce’s eyes widen as he gasps, and falls to the ground.\"Thanks, Piehl,\" Kilir says as he stands up. \"wasn’t sure how long I was going to have to entertain him.\"\"No problem man. That’s one down anyways. Let’s get the tome from the library for Jynteral’s gate. They should be about finished mutilating the nethermen by now.\"Outside of the castle, through the smoke and limbs, Yang and Jynteral stood in the middle, surrounded by nethermen corpses.\"Hah! That was fun!\" Jynteral yells.The walls of the castle seemed somehow darker. Maybe it was the bloodstains or the smoke, but the area seemed overall more menacing and evil. Kilir stored a thought into the back of his head for later.\"We have the coordinates Jynteral. Let’s get going, Gromph will have definitely heard of what’s gone on by now.\" Kilir explains, \"The plan for getting to Gromph will go a bit differently. His minions are a bit tougher, since they will keep coming once they lose their limbs. Jynt, you will need to burn the corpses enough so that there is nothing left. Me and Piehl will decapitate as many as we can, and Yang will go after Gromph. Everybody got it? Good, scene change!\"--The town of Roston was exactly that, a town. There was no castle, but instead a large manor. Complete with creepy setting and all, perfect for a necromancer.The four Forsaken walked close enough to get a good look at the town, but far enough that they wouldn’t alert the lesser undead scouting around. The basic undead walking around in the outskirts of the town were merely Nightmares, basically large horses consisting of mainly a skeleton. Further in, the spectres stood guard against any intruders. And then, in the deepest parts, were the Nightcrawlers. Large, menacing, rotting corpses of once great warriors, now doomed to serve whatever master happened to have summoned them.Kilir turns to the others and says, \"Alright guys, this is it. Jynteral, you will go first, we will be right behind you. Keep them off of Yang so he can get to Gromph. He should be around the center of town. On your mark Jynt.\"Flames sparked into life around Jynteral’s hands as he charged toward the entrance to town. Shooting long jets of flame forward from each hand, cackling like a demented madman, Jynteral mows down multiple Nightmares with the searing heat. The other three follow behind just far back enough to not get burned. Once they get close enough, Kilir and Piehl separate to the left and right, Jynteral stops and continues shooting out flames, and Yang keeps running forward toward the center of town, where Gromph can be seen summoning a myriad of undead minions.Yang charges forward on four powerful legs, four weapons all glistening in the light from the flames behind him. Two massive Nightcrawlers trudge in front of Yang’s path, ready to strike at the oncoming raknid. A pair of shadowy figures zoom past, and the Nightcrawlers roar as their heads become separated from what is left of their bodies. The two assassins hit the ground and continue their mayhem as Yang continues his speedy charge.A hint of fear can be seen on Gromph’s face as black and purple waves circle around his head, readying his necromancer’s deathtouch. Gromph reaches out to grab Yang with the long-feared signature necromancer spell, powerful enough to kill even the most powerful of enemies in a single touch.Once Yang gets within feet of Gromph his blade flashes faster than any eye could follow, and hacks off one arm. A second arm flashes and hews off the second arm. Yang’s third arm reaches out to hold Gromph’s throat, and uses his last arm to drive his final blade straight into the pale clammy forehead of the ex-warlord.\"So it’s done.\" Yang says, looking around. The remaining undead crumble into the dirt, following the fate of their master.Piehl looks at Kilir and grins. Kilir nods back to Piehl. The two demons lunge towards Yang and drive four daggers into Yang’s back, piercing down as far as they could both muster. The raknid screams in pain and tries to slice his blades back into the assassins, but the daggers pinned into his shoulder blades make moving his arms impossible.\"Thanks for your help. We are done with you.\" Kilir says.\"What did you do?!\" Jynteral screams from across the path, mouth wide open.Piehl withdraws a small dagger from his boot and throws it with ease, straight at the bridge between Jynteral’s eyes. The elf drops immediately, lifeless.And so it was, the Vyce and Gromph were defeated by the four adventurers. Word traveled fast of the happenings, and the more naïve of the realms people breathed a sigh of relief. Two fearsome warlords fighting with each other could not hope to bring the kind of terror that two warlords working in unison could create. The realm never has, and never will know the true terror that is to be under the control of Kilir and Piehl.The End.",]),(["size":53,"date":1250975830,"title":"note","owner":"stormbringer","message":"Coaches should force you to look when you exit them.",]),(["size":647,"date":1251757542,"title":"email to jerk","owner":"stormbringer","message":"Excuse me, why would you log onto my mud and make characters with such ignorant names?

In this houseis a parent figure who tells them it is time to choose their path in life. Theparent has made arrangements and if the player will just choose their class andsubclass, they can get started straight away. The player should be given theoppertunity to choose thier class/sub here.After choosing their class and sub the player should be led to a basement wherethey can get gear appropraite to their subclass, decent eq, weapons, someoil,some stones if needed, and about 2k gold. A rat primptly attacks the playerwhere they learn about combat. After killing the rat they are led back upstairswhere they can learn about whatever they have not been taught so far. When thelessons are done they should be attacked by a bandit and given the choice offighting him or joining him. If they join him the story plays out where theyare betrayed, their parents killed and they wake up on a ship to Tirun. If theyfight him, they end up beating him but his gang is now after the player and theparent puts them on a ship to tirun to begin their life in a far away land awayfrom the assassins the gang is sending.I am trying to decide wether to dump them on the docks in Tirun or have a mobmeet them there and show them the newbie things in Tirun like the newbie zoo,the delivery jobs, etc.I think having a mob meet them and at least showing them to the newbie zoowould be good.We should also make sure the guide they get from this has a good interactivemap highlighting newbie things to do.Revision: The ship will put newbies off in Arlon, I am going to make Arlon newbie town. No longer will anyone start in tirun as a newbie. Since the zoo is there and there is only one way out of arlon, through Tirun, it makes perfect sense. I am going to put off the rest of Rston while I work on getting Arlon reset. Once I am done we will change the new player script to put new characters off in Arlon.Additional idea: One idea to help give players an incentive to keep playing was a very long quest chain. This quest chain would span from level 1 to level 75, and through all the major interesting zones. It would present an interesting story line for players to follow, give a good deal of experience and cool items intermittently through the chain, and most importantly, give players a reason to go to the new areas, and some goal to work towards (be strong/high enough level to finish the next part of the quest). Working off this idea, the life qeust would be to find their parents killer, we could add a quest or deed to each area of the mud to further along the player finishing the life quest.",]),(["size":1886,"date":1272559725,"title":"Aeldritch PD Ideas","owner":"stormbringer","message":"Aeldritch tells you: I mudidead another one.
