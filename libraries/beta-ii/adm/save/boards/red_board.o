I simply play the game, i don't know off hand how much my skills cost and how many i get per level.  I don't know what it takes to make things work and in all honesty i don't really want to know that, i just wish to play my character and enjoy myself.Now with that said i'm going to tell you sp is killing me :p  yes i can play, yes it works but after killing a mob i generally spend the next 2 minutes pumping ointment to replenish my sp.  Get more dex i hear you say.... My dex isn't bad and one thing i've noticed is the more dex you have the more you use.Seeing the Gobbish decided he would go Demon i've been playing a cleric and i also have a druid which is pretty cool too.  I don't generally like to compare characters and stuff and now i can see this might start to get on the longish side because it's 2am and i can't sleep :p  Doe is pretty good basically kill kill kill and occassionally give the stone a rub.  Wildsilk as far as killing goes is pretty ok too at level 36 before i took her elite she was killing the same stuff Wisp can and again she can xp Wisp under the ground doing full rooms kill kill rub stone.  None of my other characters are anything over the top, they work and i can pretty much continuiously xp without having to stop and wait where i have to with Wisp to replenish my Sp.I have partied with other dragon colours and they don't have the same problem and neither they should, Dragon's in all rights are fairly wise and intelligent creatures all they have to do is rub stone.  Again i've partied with different classes, now pretty much everyone knows (unless you want a challenge) to make a fighter/rogue you pick a race that has cheapish dex/con and if you are going to be a mage/cleric you go for the wiser abilities.  Red Dragons don't have that choice, they are stuck into the mould of every dragon colour who have not great sp and pretty good wis/int costs.Now with that said i'm going to make a new post with some ideas as not to make this one not even longer.Wisp",]),(["size":985,"date":1100884169,"title":"continued","owner":"wisp","message":"Now again i'll say i don't know the ins and outs of how things work, i don't understand how to make cool spell or abilities.  I'm an ideas sort of person and basically that is that.1.  Ointments could be changed so that they ooze like stone.  Which would help the classes that can only use sp abilities.2.  As Red Dragon's aren't stupid (i have nearly more mp than hp and i've not spent alot on wis/int) after level 50 and with 50 plus int and wis, maybe 75 they could gain the ability to boost not huge amounts like a cleric but enough to sustain like paladins.  This would have to be trained as a skill from 0.3.  After level 50 and with int/wis 50+ they have enough nouse to sustain their flow of sp, halving the amount of sp used.4.  After level 50 and with int/wis 50+ they could have the ability to 'Sap' their mp into sp therefore being able to use the useless mp.I did have another one, but it's late and i can't remember what it was.Thank you for your time.Wisp",]),(["size":147,"date":1103789549,"title":"Note dex to int/wis","owner":"wisp","message":"To get 100 dex it costs 10 mil.To get 100 int/wis i have been told it will cost me 6 895 000Reds don't use Int/wis but we survive on DexWisp",]),(["size":56,"date":1158911168,"title":"skills","owner":"spade","message":"think maybe we could get the rage skill? makes sense :o",]),(["size":14,"date":1165490372,"title":"best","owner":"spade","message":"i am the best",]),})
