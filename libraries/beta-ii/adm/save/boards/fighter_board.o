Lots of double-wielding abilities,so probably nothing with shields.Berserkers - a couple more axe moves, a bunch of melee moves, anda few blunt abilities, coupled with fury-style abilities that willwork mainly on the user like adrenaline. Probably an intimidationmove or two. Rage will probably change just a little bit (for the better).Ranger - hunters. They will have more bow and spear moves, as wellas some defensive and stealth abilities, and a few of their extrathings like brew still need work. Maybe add different herbs they canfind.Paladins - paragons of good, riding into battle with a sword in onehand and shield in the other. A shieldbash-style move seems appropriate,and some defensive spells. Abilities that work better against evilthings are also in order.Antipaladins - evil, nasty, torturers. They will gain some whipabilities, and a spell to create a whip, much like mysticblade.Attack spells and perhaps some debuffs, or even stealing otherpeople's stats.That's how I envision the various subs... please feel free to suggestideas along those lines (or outside of them even).",]),(["size":384,"date":1167540723,"title":"bloodfist","owner":"yang","message":"Yet another one of my whacked out ideas...Bloodfist, you cut a part of your flesh, dip your hands in your own blood and watch it harden around your knuckles, temporarily hardening your fists allowing your melee attacks to hit harder...

Was thinking that Rangers could summon the \"heart of nature\" an animal that would help assist with its master - similar to Kataans summon, but Rangers would only have one \"Heart of Nature\"- the summon will naturally change from a  squirrel to a dog to a wolf etc ... then ultimately a bear- depending on Nature skills and lvl Now for Antipaladins. I was thinking about their direct link with their demonic beliefs.  I know their ability to bloodlust, but was thinking that it should be tweaked or another move should be added at a higher lvl.  Blood, weather it be human or demon can be used as a sacrifice to please the great Asmodeous but only a self sacrifice would make him happy.  While giving up a percentage in con to gain str and dex  giving them an \"Evil Birth right\"Paladins may have something similar to an Evil Birth Right or maybe something that gives more con and str or dex (con giving the paladin an increase in defense) something of this calibur may be considered \"Godly Justification\" (we'll play with names later)Warriors wanna have a few warcries, things that enhance certain skills or somethingI also think that once a fighter reaches a certain skill or lvl or stat that charge for anyone should become a single round attack and hopefully later they would be able to do a dbl charge by themselvesOk, Im almost done now, I really would like to talk to anyone who'd like to listen specially Nul.

It seems suitable to me that a fighter would be well-versed in all combat weapons, regardless of his subclass. a 5 in all weapons seems fair enough to me, considering the lack of depth in weapon choice I dont forsee myself using a flail or projectile on my fighterPlenty of classes get 6 in some weapon categories.. I know you told me 5 was reserved for subclasses who have special talent with a weapon, but wouldnt it make more sense to say that the six's are the ones reserved for special subs and a 5 is kind of a standard practince needed for fighters to max out thier potential? I mean, i'm not going to invest in flails or projectiles but i may invest in axes and blunts, which as we all know takes a ruthless amount of hours grinding out xp to max out skills at a high lvl..so i still have to earn itThat being said I do believe antipals should get 6 blade..Seems fitting that an antipaladin would be better suited with a sword, and considering thier vain, sinful nature, would likely get attached to a certain weapon and become more efficient with that oneNext, the shimmer ability, the name and the message are both silly anyways, and the damage is comparable to jab, and lets be honest no one is going to use it, ever for any reason. I say remove it and give them a better buff, or remove it and give them an elite attack that is basically a spell but would be based of off physical stats..Ok just had an idea..remove shimmer and give them a spell/abil called TerrorizeBasically it would be a fear spell, it would paralyze the oponnent 1-3 rounds, inflict a minimal amount of damage, lower thier stats/skills while paralyzed..

Not all fightershave 6 bladebecause it helps to show which subs really specialize in it.I see antis and paladins as being very good with blades, but beingreligiously dedicated means they aren't quite as good as those who practicewith them all the time. Of course each of them do have skills theythat are 6 per level, just not blade.As for the anti abils/spells, I fully agree that shimmer needs to,at least, be changed, and maybe just replaced altogether.I don't know if antipaladins will be getting any paralyzation abilities,but probably not.
