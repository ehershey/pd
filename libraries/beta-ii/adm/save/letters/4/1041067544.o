__Letter "Hey there baby. I finally got to level 20. *cheers* I changed my in and out messages, but that took forever. :( but it's done now. I also got rid of that stupid title and replaced it with an equally stupid one because i was not very creative at the moment.I can't wait to see you again. *Savannah kisses you passionately before slipping away into the shadows.*"
