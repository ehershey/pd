__Letter "I am thinking of the following guildlines for buildersAll other security measures will remain in place.This only pertains to the individual builders /wizards dir.I am thinking of 3 levels.level 1 : \"scan\" ..... summary, objcmds, stat, ac, wclevel 2 : \"read\" ..... more, cp, lslevel 3 : \"full\" ..... read and write access.Basically the security_function() they set on their workroomwould allow them one of the 3 levels. It would of course bea mapping.int access_granted(mapping members);([ \"ironman\":\"read\", \"stormbringer\":\"full\", \"luna\":\"scan\" ])That mapping would give me read and scan access, you full accessand luna only the ability to scan the builder's objects.Ironman"
