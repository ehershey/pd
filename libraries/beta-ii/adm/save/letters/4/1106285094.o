__Letter "I did not make that dagger so that only me and the mob can wield it, you acn check the wield function in the code. There is armour in the throne room close to that. Some of the weapons are so powerful i didnt want players wielding them, i just wanted them to hack at players.Stormie knows this, and approved the code i came up with, that same wield func code is in most of the guild weapons. The some of the throne room armour is the same way and some of it is meant only for Liches. Please dont change anything with out at LEAST letting me know what you changed so i know what to code in the future."
