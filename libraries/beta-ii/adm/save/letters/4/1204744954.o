__Letter "Hi yourself,I know you're busy too, and I hope your trip goes well.  I've been trying to getthings done here, rearranging, etc.  They were going tohave the carpetscleaned in the suite downstairs, but didn't get a chance, so I will beliving out of boxes until Friday, when they clean them.They don't want me putting too much stuff away, because they have to movemy furniture around.  The suite is 2 bedroom, quite nice and Trevor saidI can stay there until I find a house I want to buy.My old house has two potential buyers, one of them backed out, so hopefully it will sell soon.Had some legal things to do with Nick, so it was tiring dealing with him.I have been to more counselling sessions to help me through.  I knowin my heart now that Josh didn't care as much about me as he said hedid.  Paul (counsellor) told me to just now treat Josh as if he was acasual friend.  He told me not to worry about trying to be friendswith K and that if at some time in the future, I do meet them, he wassure I will be fine.  He told me to focus on any relationship I now have and to come to termswith the fact that J didn't care enough about me to wait for me.  So, I know that part can be put away.  I'm working on the Nick stuff morenow, I had to be go back to the times with him and we worked on that.I do miss you a lot.  I don't know what to do about the microphone, itsays I'm missing a .dll file and I've tried to do it.  I will find the cdsthat would have the sound files on it and try to reinstall it.  Miss you tons, and love to the man of my dreams.Love,Raynaxo"
