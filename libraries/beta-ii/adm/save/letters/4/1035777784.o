__Letter "Dear Wraith,Become a vegan.  You can't ever hope to gain her confidence if you're always insisting that her relatives come over for \"dinner\".  Of course.. If you ever do decide to date something within the realms of your own race I'm sure we can find.. something for you.  Maybe then the two of you can enjoy a date without having to resort to dinner at Chick-fila."
