__Letter "They are keeping the markable teleport thing, but it can't be marked in their hall anymoreOf course you can have a markable item for your guild :) I want all guilds to be able to get the same type of gear. As far as the Ahram thing, forgive my letter, when I read yours it was right after reading two others stating it was wrong. Does not matter much now though, Ashram does not want Ashram back, he told me he was surpirsed I did not dest him earlier...Stormy"
