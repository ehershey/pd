__Letter "I'm interested in starting a new guild. I have all the required gold.What else do I need to do for this to be possible? Should I send you room descriptions, requests for a few specific items (just items for looks. no combat value), and other things?Also would I be allowed to have a scry pool in my guild, like other guilds have currently?Thanks,-- Vyce"
