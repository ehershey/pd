__Letter "I went to LPCmuds.net to check some stuff out and while running through  the forums I noticed a post by a builder looking for a mud to work on. The post was more than half a year old but I emailed the guy. He stopped by today and made a character and started checking the mud out. His name is Doulos and his email is kcaryths@gmail.comAnyhow, if you see him around take some time to talk with him and get a feel for him. He has been mudding since 1996 and played mainly at Antient Anguish which was also my first serious mud at about the same time. I do not know him from  there though.Just for reference Ancient Anguish is a huge LPmud with some of the greatest ideas implemented in a mud I have seen. What I tried to do with rangers here with foraging and stuff was an idea from their rangers.Stormy"
