__Letter "Ok, well once I had been to work I kinda got a (very) little jealous. Atfirst before I had just wanted to make sure that you had someone to talk toand help. But at work my thoughts strayed. Hah, I don't have the mostintellectually challenging job.Anyway, I thought I might say how I felt about it all, now that I havesorted it through my mind.I cannot really be jealous, when I first met you you were with Gabe, andthen immediately with Warren. Both before I knew at all your feelings. Noweven when we came together you said that you were still dating Warren, so Iam resigned to the fact that that will be there. My main... emotion, isdisappointment. Not at you, just at myself and the circumstances I am in. Iwant to do anything for you and so I feel that you should not need anotherto... satisfy your physical needs. That brings me sadness, the things I missout on...*sigh* And this leads on to even more. It makes me think that you wouldrather be with Warren. Hah, see how insecure I am, such foolishness. Butstill, this all comes back to the House of Cards.And finally, I am so frustrated that I can't change things. I have become soused to being able to do anything, and now I am stuck. The earliest I couldchange things would be months away at the earliest, and even then it wouldbe risky. To stay in another country for very long without someone to helpsupport you there is very expensive. Even if I were to get a job and be onsome kind of exchange type thing I should still need US5k saved to make sureI could afford a place to stay and a trip home if things went bad. Bah, lookat me probing all the flaws in something that is so far away.But hey, I am glad that you told me about it. I do not want you to feel atall as though you are hiding something from me (if you would have felt thatway), and it was good to let you have someone to listen to.[ break ]Hmm, I am starting to feel the loss of friends a bit harder now. James isleaving in about a week, Daniel in a few months, and the one person I wantto visit most...[ break ]Also, I talked to Gabe at Anime. He sold his character to Lac, and since Idon't think you are supposed to give characters away Lac is just ignoringeveryone that sends him a tell meant for Gabe. Oh, and Gabe asked if youwere playing again and I said yeah. He asked me to send him a message thenext time I see you on, I hope this ok?Oh, and I took my camera with me. Since Halo is leaving soon I  felt Ishould get a picture with him in it. Got one of him and Gabe, and one ofHalo at Gabe's computer spot. They aren't brilliant, but nice to have them.[ break ]I hope I was restrained enough while you were at your friend's house?Believe me it was not at all easy. I was kinda hoping you picked up on mymentioning the 'plan' we were having fun coming up with. I also hope thatyou thought I was singing that song, rather than just reciting the words. :)Sorry I wasn't able to get a good picture going, it really does seem thatyou have to get them in the moment. Yours, for example, is a very good photoeven though it isn't an 'action shot', because you were so happy and hypedabout the dance.[ break ]I have been having *alot* of fun imagining the organised first meeting, itsounds like such fun leaving parents clueless as to the fact that the entirething is staged. :)I ahve also had to keep myself content with... other thoughts until we canbe on together without interruption. ;)Forever Yours,    Jon."
