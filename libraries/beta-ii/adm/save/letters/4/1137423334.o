__Letter "tomb - It's just far to large and straight. It needs to have some random directions and be cut down quiet a bit. Also the mob placement doesn't make any sense. I'm in a room with a scorpion a mummy and a lion, now why is a lion in the pyramid, and why is he hanging out with a mummy? And I want you to remove all the specials on all of your weapons, at most you should have 1 or 2 weapons with specials on them. But in this case, I want just one. I also want you to cut it down to at most 150 rooms. And I want you to remap the area, a straight line will not be accepted.marsh - Well, first off, the rooms descrips are far too short. 2 sentances is not acceptable. at least 4 is pretty much the standard.  and it still feels like I'm being guided by the area rather than exploring it. it is very direct and doesn't feel random. The mob selection is also strange, I don't know why there is a dwarf or a halfling hanging out in a swamp. Every room should not have mobs, there is simply no real reason for a swamp to be packed full of mobs. There are very few areas were I would allow this kind of packing. Being the area is a swamp, the size of it doens't bother me as much, but I still think it is too big. Try and keep this one limited to 150 as well. But first and formost your room descriptions need expansion.eyeofhell - well, the number of rooms is better. The rooms descrips are still a little short. And every room shouldn't have a mob. Looks like this area is better in that respect. I am also concerned with your injection of christian mytholgoy in your area here, and any future areas. Remember, we are are own universe, so I don't like the idea of this area being the actual hell."
