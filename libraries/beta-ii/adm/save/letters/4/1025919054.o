__Letter "Yeah, the problem is with the Giant Oozes on the second level of tirun sewers. Because I use poison breath to fight, if they lose their body without taking a mortal blow to the torso, then they will lose their heartbeat. I was just using my breathe attack and flameclaw to kill them also. However they die normmally as long as I get the message about mortal blows to torso in the same round as their body being severed.Hope that helps you outHalogen"
