__Letter "Well, I talked to both parties. I told aldur that he knew he accepted the responsibilities of becoming a demon in that he might be killed by angels. I also went on a small rant when he said that I was biased.I talked to ashram, found out that yes he had been using a trigger to compare himself when someone went linkdead.
