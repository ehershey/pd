__Letter "May I talk with you sometime? Sorry about soulfly but he scry'd me and came in and started to kill me for the second time, so I tried to convince him that what he was doing was not the right thing. Later he came to me in lodos and said 'move'. I knew he was going to try and pk me eventually, so rahter than have him start harassing me again I just let him pk me so he would be quiet, unfortunately he wasn't :(	- Aziraphale"
__Undeleted ({"stormbringer",})
