__Letter "Resolution, you are a Demon of merit in this realm.This being said, I feel you are wasting your talents and time with Darksoul.  I could include you in something I know that you would be greatly amused by, hell might even have some fun.However, in order to be able to include you in this, I have to know where your loyalties lay in this realm.You have a place within Unholy if you want to take it.  And I would like for you to be a part of the Guild.  It would be equally beneficial to the both you and the rest of Unholy.I know you're curious if nothing else.  So give me an answer when you read this, so I know where we stand.Just know one thing, if you take your place in Unholy, there won't be any turning back.%^GREEN%^~*~%^BLACK%^BOLD%^Bellos d'Terrible - %^MAGENTA%^Asmodeus' %^BLACK%^Chosen%^RESET%^GREEN%^~*~"
