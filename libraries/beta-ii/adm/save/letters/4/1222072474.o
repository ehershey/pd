__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Uzamaki to Uzamaki Mon Sep 22 04:24:30 2008:-----Dear Rohl, it saddens me that you would believe that I'd attackyou. I was partied with Freddie and he said he wanted to meetover Rhondale for rebuff. If I had come to attack you, I couldveattacked you in that room over Rhondale. I didnt because thatwas not my intent. We've been through a good bit over the years onthis game. I've had two separate characters die in campaignsrelated to you: Escobar died trying to retrieve your corpse on Purgand Sabado died in S3 getting dragged around by you and pwned by someberserker in 1 hit. But, it seems you just wanna assume the worst and then insultpeople. I think it's in everyone's best interest to talk truce.If you don't wanna, that's fine. But as of now, I would feel foolishto assume I was safe from attack from you and yours. As such, I cannotpromise you the same. If we all worked together, there'd be no endto what we could accomplish. But, if you wanna make war, we cankill each other a few dozen times and let folks like Last Saintsbecome the best guild. I personally prefer peace, but right now,the ball is in your court.Uza"
