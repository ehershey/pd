__Letter "i think that the use of the auction line is greater than the chance that someone marks a seal with a word and is able to auction it like every 2 minutes.  idk.  i also think the fact that i'm gagged is ridiculous anyways, i never even saw amun saying that she was going to gag people even when she was idle, she says that's the only reason why i said something like that but i was IDLE EATING DINNER WHEN SHE SAID THAT, and what i said was not newbie line inappropriate, people have said MUCH WORSE on the newbie line than that and don't get punished for it.  i even said the bad part of my sentence on the mature line."
