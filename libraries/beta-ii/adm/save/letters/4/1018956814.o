__Letter "Hey dude. um when i was arenaing lac i still had my wimpy on trigger which is when it says you run away i open rift. so i opened a rift to the demon hall. i went up. i accidently left it on when i arena'd faust and he just quit and lost in the arena. so when it happened again vs lac. i asked him to quit and he wouldnt. so i type quit. and i died, i was transported to the losers room as a ghost. it was a real death i lost 2 lvls and all my eq. my corpse disappeared. i think my corpse was deleted or something im not sure. I lost my demon amulet aswell so i cannot open rift. I was just wondering if it would be possible to give me back my lvl's and my demon amulet. never mind about the eq. by the time you get this and im on i will probably have a good substitute. if you cant give me back my lvls and stuff thats cool.Please mudmail me back or send me a msg when im on man :)Luc"
