__Letter "Hi, it's me again.  I've decided to leave this mud, I guess it's for severalreasons.  It is hard being on here, because I do miss James, but I haveseveral things to deal with in my own life here.  I found it really hardtrying to be something I'm not - playing a male on here.  It hurt me quitedeeply when you said those things about male/female roles.  James hasseen a few pictures of me and I have talked to him numerous times.Nothing I can do about it any more, but when I was on as a male alt,the conversation became uncomfortable.  Anyway, it doesn't matter now.  I was deeply hurt that you even thought Iwasn't a woman.  I have 6 brothers and I do everything I can to be a girl, buttrying to think up things on here as a guy was more difficult than I thought.I had met one or two people from Shadowmud in real life, who would vouchfor me being a girl.  Oh well, doesn't matter any more.I enjoyed talking to you, I miss James a lot.  There's no point in beingon here any more, because it hurts too much.Take care,Rayna"
