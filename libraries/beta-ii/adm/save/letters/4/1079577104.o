__Letter "Ok, well... I've been brainstorming dragon changes, now that balance is in/about to be in. I've got HEAPS of ideas, and I wouldn't mind coding them myself... (I'll need access on builder's port tho')1) Upgrade breathe a great deal, make it really buff... like about the damage of charge... but you can only use it three times every fifteen minutes, so you can't use it every round.2) Change the formula of breathe to make it work partially off age of the dragon as well... 3) Upgrade the other melee attacks to make them useful when you've used your breathes... 4) Change flameclaw from an attacking move to a move which doubles your melee and increases your claw skillby 1/3 for a certain amount of time... 5) Introduce a gold requirement on dragons to level, so you have to have an exponentially increasing amount of gold in the bank before you can advance, if you don't have enough you can't advance... 6) Give dragons a 'coup like' move which is where you eat them whole... 7) Introduce my new dragon quest which is hard and complicated and long and polymorphic (so it's never the same twice). ;) 8) At level 50, all dragons must write the descriptions for their den's which they must have beforethey can advance beyond 50... And their gold must be kept in their den, which can be robbed. Naturally they can buy their own guards and locks and traps and such, I'll work on those.And that's it. :D Just my efforts to make PD dragons really really different from anything else out there, on PD or otherwise."
