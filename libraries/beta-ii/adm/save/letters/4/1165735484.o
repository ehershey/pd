I?m so sorry =( We can make room for the customers, no problem =) Please just make sure they understand, we don?t support much more then theservers (past the install of course) ? this is not one of those hand-holding hosts anymore.. like you, 9 years was enough for me onthat one. I will even honor any time they had prepaid with you, and not charge them again for it. Regards,Dale----------------------Dale CorseSystem AdministratorWolfpaw Services IncPh: 888-965-3729"
