__Letter "I accidentally PKed seras and was given 2 murder offences for it instead of 1... hopefully it can be fixed (on my end and whyever it happened)  i killed him using firebomb.  i think the first may have put him into negatives and given me one, then the second killed him and gave me another?  i'm not sure though."
