__Letter "Have you noticed how I haven't actually said anything about it in ages? oh that's because I don't give a fuck anymore.Oh and when did I abuse you? Sure I pked you in the past but apart from that I never spoke to you so I don't see how I actually have ever abused you.Oh and the last thing i'm ever going to say on the scripting issue is this: You said NS removed 600mil from you for scripting.. Well I know from personal experience that 600 is only a weeks worth of actual xping for me if I can really be botherd. So does that mean you were only scripting for a week? OMG I think not, I know you where scripting for longer then that, sure I have no proof, but I am leaving it alone now cause I know that nothing is going to be done to you.  --Eios."
