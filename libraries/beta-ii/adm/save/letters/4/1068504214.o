__Letter "when you start the harass log, you can type <last say> and all of your last says will show up in the log as well.  The only thing I really saw in the log was you cussing out galdur....  You may have had good reason to, but in the log he doesnt do anything.  If he does in the future, just turn on the log and do a last say and it'll be taken care of.                  -Nightshade"
