__Letter "Alas the heavans could not sustain the evil they had adopted from the mortal lands and have thrown the Immortal Wraith back into the depths of the struggle for good and evil. Coming back to the underground hideout that he built, he joins up with the only people that understood him. Now back with the Dark Souls, Wraith searches for more ways to spread his evil across the lands.Hows that for a come back?"
