__Letter "I'm going to try like hell, man. But here's my situation. About 4 months ago I tried moving from Indiana to N. Carolina. Didn't work out as well as planned, so I'm back in Indiana. We're staying with my GF's sister and I've been on her computer this whole time. Well, it's time for us to move out into our own place w/no computer or net connection. It won't take long for me to get one, I'd imagine 2 months at the most. But I will surely try to be on Sunday.If I can't make it, send me a mudmail here. Let me know what's been done and what's waiting on me to do. This is something I'm dying to get in the game, but as I was telling Pyro, I've got around 215 rooms coded with no end in sight. Also I've got about 5 quests I want to write, don't know where to start on that. So all in all, this project might go on hold for a while but I have every intention of hurrying back. I will be able to come over and check in periodically so I say we keep in touch on these things.Thanks, man.John"
