__Letter "Hello Daboura, I don't know what is going on for builders or who is doing what but I just saw your post about mudmail you the information. So here we go :PI would like to do a tundra area south of tirun. There was a hilly area first then into some deep carin then mountains with snow on the peak leading into the tundra. (Daos and I worked with someone on this). I submitted a large number of rooms which I still plan on executing. I have been working on this on and off due to my work schedule. (Also been hard to describe white everywhere and make it semi-different for each room). This was to be a high elite area. There are several monsters. There is even a cold weather outfit for going there. I wanted to add the skill of climbing to this area. (maybe even skiing! joke) I don't know what else you want to know about but please let me know if there are any changes you wish to see. I will be working with daos soon to get some of the rooms done. I hope that my area will be good enough not only for you but for the mud.Thanks Summer"
