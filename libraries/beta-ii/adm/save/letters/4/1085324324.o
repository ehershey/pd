__Letter "Hey,I can finally get back on (I couldn't connect through 5000, using 5001 and now) and yeah I'd just like to say... now that this is all over... I just wanna close the last thing. Anything you might say is entirely off the record, by the way, so say what you like- it won't be forwarded to any other staff member or player and is just between you and I as people.I don't know how you feel, but I don't have any anger at all towards you or Evolution. I lost my temper once or twice (once each, actually), but apart from that I never really have... I was just trying to do my job the best way I know how, you know? I try to be impartial, but it's hard with so many friends here... but I do my best, calling it as I see it, and that's all I can do really. I would love it if everyone just got along- but sometimes they don't. No friendship is without rough patches.So yeah... I would like to think we are still friends after this. As you said, and I agree, it's just a game- to loose a good friend like you over something so silly as this is silly to me. So, yeah... write me back with your thoughts. Or, if you don't write back, I guess I know what that means. That'll make me pretty sad.-- Dave."
