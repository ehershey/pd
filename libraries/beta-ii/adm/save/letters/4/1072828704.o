__Letter "/wizards/kumi/areas/ethereal/objects/bean.c/wizards/kumi/areas/ethereal/objects/dew.cI'm not quite sure how this works, but I didn't yet pay for these two items to get in, so don't forget to charge me for them. The magic beans are our stones, and mountain dew is our oil. Do I need to buy another room (shop) for this? If so let me know.Thanks Again!-Jen"
