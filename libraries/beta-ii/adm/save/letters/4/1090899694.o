__Letter "I recalled us(the jesters) having juggle at lv 15 with a maxed entertainment, but I found I did not have it.  So I decided to see if a help file still existed, but it didn't.  Well I recall how it was crashing the mud and I was wondering if it was removed?  If so will it ever be returned to us?Silk the court Harlequinn"
