__Letter "I need to get to bed as I will have to get up early in the mronging. I said some more stuff, it's all be in last tell (should be). Now here's the other stuff:I was talking to Kumi about this some today and she suggested that I stop sending Jon pictures if he doesn't send me any, and that I stop talking to him for a little bit. Basically a \"if he doesn't do this, then you don't either\" kind of thing. I personally don't agree with it, it's too much like \"getting even\" and i dont' want to tdo that. But I was wondering what you thought of it, and if something to that effect (not necessarily that) be effective in making a point for Jon?I don't know, I don't really need it right now. Like I said, we did talk it out some tonight and I did feel a bit better about it. I don't think I'll have to go to any extremes. Jon will listen to me and we'll work it out. Well thanks for chatting with me tonight, it's helped a lot and you've been a real encouragement. :)Tell helena goodnight for me to. :)goodnight,Jacie"
