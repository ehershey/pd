__Letter "Think of this as a regular post, but I'm using mail because it contains some sensitive information.  Anyway, I wanted to say that the XP cuts are good, especially if what rueznor says is true (post 56 on newbie).  Because of the way the XP curve for mobs is designed there is an inherent flaw in it.  There is a \"sweet spot\" of the curve that gives the greatest XP for the least effort.  This is because when the XP curve was designed, it was made as a combination of an exponential and linear increase.  This \"25k\" mob that rueznor mentions is just at said point.  I still like the way the xp curve is, as it allows lower levels to ramp up a bit more quickly than having to do a heavy grind up to 20, but the XP cut needs to prevent the higher levels from feasting on these mobs that are needed for the newbies.  I dont know if it was intentional, but I do think it's a great idea of the next \"level\" of abilities is aquired just after having leveled to high to make use of that sweet spot in the XP curve.  It will give incentive for players to level beyond that point and will cause some of the higher level areas to be used more often.-NS"
