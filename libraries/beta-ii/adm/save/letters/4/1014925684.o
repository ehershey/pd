__Letter "Hi ya, heres some ideas, if we keep this player base it would be nice if the dragon quest would be open again.  Like I said, these are just ideas, and since I don't know what you have planned as far as paramiters set before the dragon quest can be achieve, some of it may be far fetched.Also, I don't know if you plan on having more then four different types of dragons.1. If you want to keep the orignal quest, change where the child should die, for example make a room that checks for child and have them die but the change will be, no announcement of a death, maybe have two different death scenes, one for regular deaths, and one for dragons.  The reason being is that anyone can just steal the ring, and get out of the death scene faster (once they know about it)  This way, everything is done for you, just minor changes here and there.  With the statue in the [] the only clue to the quest.2. Have many statue, or more specific one of every kind of dragon you wish to have, now there are two senerios to this one.    a. one senerio is have player search out the dragon statue that wish to be.  Each dragon have a different riddle on how to become that dragon.  For instance, the Red dragon is more of a fighter type, (this will only work if you put in live dragons) to become a red dragon, they have to kill the other three dragons (Also this prolly only work if you set the dragon quest at a higher level).  bring back an item from each dragon and set it before the statue, whatever syntax you want as far as presenting the items to the statue, and they become a red dragon.  Make each one different.    b. senerio two, have each dragon represent an element, red = fire, blue = water, black = death, white = life...it dosn't have to do anything about the dragon, but let them just represent it for the quest.  each statue is missing the corresponding element, go find the element place it in the statue.  Now the fun part of this, you don't have to have an actuall element.  For instance, white is life, what gives life (hp) oils...place oil on statue.  It takes a lot of thought into it, people make actually look for an element called life.  Hope this one made sense.3. Each reboot, different dragon.  If one wants to be a certain dragon, they have wait till it's that dragon's turn to shine.  Maybe make it seasonal, or just make it random.  I wouldn't know exactly how one would know which dragon they will become, or how to go about it, but it could be used to help balance out the dragons.  If two many Black dragons appear...make it where you can only become white and red.  It's playing god a little bit, and takes a hell of a lot more coding...but it's just a thought.Well that is all I have for now, I was going to sugguest something ridiculas like for instance, each dragon is being represented,  work us into the storyline, we are all females in search for a worthy mate...whatever it may be.  It could be temp. till the real quest get in.  But like I said stupid, but it might spark something in you.Another suggestion, maybe have a few ways to become a dragon, dying for it, becoming one, after so many dragons, switch to the next quest, it will keep the leaks to a min, and you'll be prepared next time, instead of shutting it compleatly down.Thank-you for your timeHepualaha'ole"
