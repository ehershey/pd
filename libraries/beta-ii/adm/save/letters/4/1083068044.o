__Letter "I've inducted Balbane into the guild, though he will stay at squire until both you and Maz approve of him.  He is Byblos, i don't really trust him because he left the guild last time to help Kumi with coding.  I asked him why he wanted into AoD if he was in Etheral, he basically said he wanted to get into a more xp orientated guild *shrugs*I would also like to go back to the original idea we had of having a council room where we have a board that just the leaders and councillors can read, so we can discuss these sort of things.luv yaWisp"
