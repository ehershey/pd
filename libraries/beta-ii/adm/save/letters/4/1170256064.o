__Letter "Nulvect's post called \"issues\" says it all. Even if he dedicated 100%of his time to coding here, It still wouldn't be fast enough forsomeone. He needs help and I'm more then happy to do so.You know i can handle alot more complex coding then commands frombuilders. However, I will do whatever you ask me to get done. I'm planning on being on fairly often. The following is pretty muchmy routine free-time;    mon - fri === 9a to noon , 6:30p to 8:30p          sat === 6:30p to 8:30p          sun === 9a to 8:30pYou can reach me on-line during those hours. You may also call mycell-phone if you ABSOLUTELY need to reach me.. 1-718-812-2346Ironman"
