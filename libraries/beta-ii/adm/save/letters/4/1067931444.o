Every wall is |        covered with hundreds of runes, and both the floor and        |     [X]ceiling have a spiderweb pattern. In the centre of the room   |        lies a tree stump with a Dendrinar standing atop it.          |         There is only one obvious exit: out.Young Dendrinara Tree Stump is here.> You are stiff as stone.> You cannot go that way.> You cannot go that way.> You are stiff as stone.Young Dendrinar attacks Alchemon with a trailing green cord of lifeforce!Alchemon's lifetap invades your lifeforce with their own!hp: 1070    sp: 521    mp: 541Young Dendrinar destroys you utterly in the torso with his magic.shYou are stiff as stone.> You run away.You cannot go that way.Young Dendrinar attacks Alchemon with a trailing green cord of lifeforce!Alchemon's lifetap invades your lifeforce with their own!hp: 569    sp: 521    mp: 541Young Dendrinar destroys you utterly in the right arm with his magic.shYou are stiff as stone.> shYou are stiff as stone.> You run away.You cannot go that way.A yellow pulse from your robes absorb the power of the blow and turn it intohealing energies!Young Dendrinar attacks Alchemon with a trailing green cord of lifeforce!Alchemon's lifetap invades your lifeforce with their own!hp: 70    sp: 522    mp: 605Young Dendrinar destroys you utterly in the head with his magic.shshYou are stiff as stone.> You are stiff as stone.> shshYou run away.You cannot go that way.A yellow pulse from your robes absorb the power of the blow and turn it intohealing energies!Young Dendrinar attacks Alchemon with a trailing green cord of lifeforce!Alchemon's lifetap invades your lifeforce with their own!hp: -340    sp: 522    mp: 717Young Dendrinar destroys you utterly in the torso with his magic.You are stiff as stone.> shYou are stiff as stone.> You are stiff as stone.> A hushed silence fills the realms at the death of Alchemon.Alchemon skyrockets high into the sky, ascending into the heavens.You feel like there is a lawful presence here.You can move again.dYou cannot go that way."
