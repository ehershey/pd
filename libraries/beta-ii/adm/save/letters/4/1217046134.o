__Letter "Hey, sweet love. Today was a long, long day. :) I still didn'tsleep since yesterday. :) Was a lil scared to sleepand also got into playing video games, heh. I ended upgoing to this famous cheesesteak place in Philly with Sundarand then we dropped food off to Myra. Afterwards, we saw theX-Files movie. It was ok, nothing too special but it flowed well. :)Then...we saw The Dark Knight, te batman sequel. Heath Ledgerwas freakin' phenomenal! I was nearly moved to tears at the endwhen I realized he'll never make a sequel. :( The action was solid and the pacing wasn't too bad. anyway, lemme save somethingfor tomorrow's email. :D Take care, sweet love and have lots and lots of fun!!!Love,Your James"
