Thank God that's all done. Ianswered some FAQ/Walkthroughs and put them in. Due to a couple of peoples'wild imaginations and their intent to see that this FAQ/Walkthrough is NEVER,EVER completed, they suggested that I put in the Ansem's reports. Instead ofposting each report like they are presented in the game, I've just posted allof them together, when a new report begins, the first word is CAPPED. I alsoadded a CHALLENGES!!! section. If you choose to take place in a challenge andyou want to let me know you completed it, please submit a gamesave so I can seeit. I am about to start my own challenge of going through the game on EXPERTtaking less than my old score of 2709 hits.

Iupdated those and when I did the Synthesis Items, I noticed my Item List waswrong. I incorrectly posted that there are Frost, Thunder, Blaze, Power andSpirit Crystals. There is no such items. I'm sorry for posting that. The thingis, no body noticed it but me!There are many ways to contact me, so if you need additional help, or you havesome corrections, or if ya just wanna say \"hello\" you can...just to warn youthough, I rarely check my Yahoo! email, if you absolutely email me, try toemail me at my Hotmail account.Email me at:cody_rs_2004@hotmail.comcody_rs_2004@yahoo.comMy Yahoo screen name is:cody_rs_2004My MSN screen name is:cody_rs_2004My AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) screen name is:CodyRS20042.

Thestrategy guide will work for the EXPERT setting, except for that enemies arealot stronger, dealing around twice as much damage as their NORMAL settingcounterparts do.One more note, if I use caps for something (Example: TAKE, PICK, ARCANUM,STRIKE.) This means it is a command you use in the command menu, it will appearas the bottom option.3.1 AWAKENINGMy Level: 1CUTSCENEAfter a slightly confusing opening cinema and my favorite song, you takecontrol of Sora who is standing on a green platform with a picture of SnowWhite and other characters from that movie. This a just a tutorial for now, sofollow the commands as they are presented. Walk into the center of theplatform. Three pedistals are presented to you. The one on the left has ashield, the center has a sword, and the one on the right has a magic rod. Eachone represents a stat aspect. You are supposed to choose 2 objects. But,depending on whether it's your first choice or second will affect the statpositively or negatively, respectively. The object that you didn't choose isn'taffected at all, you will continue to gain more of it's attributes in a normalmanner. It is recommended that if this is your first time playing, you choosethe power of the guardian and discard the power of the mystic, although Ididn't and made it through just fine. Here's the laydown on what each objectdoes.The Dream Shield- The power of the guadian. Kindness to aid friends. A shieldto repel all. If you choose the Dream Shield for your first choice, yourdefense and HP will level up more frequently than other stats throughout thegame. You also start the game with higher defense. If it's your second choice,your defense and HP will level up less frequently than your other statsthroughout the game.The Dream Sword- The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword ofterrible destruction. If you choose the Dream Sword first, your offense willlevel up more frequently than your other stats, if you choose it second, yourstrength will level up less frequently than your other stats.The Dream Rod- The power of the mystic. Inner strength. A staff of wonder andruin. If you choose the Dream Rod first, your MP and AP will level up morefrequently than other stats throughout the game.You also start the game withhigher MP and AP. If you choose it second, your MP and AP will level up lessfrequently than your other stats.I usually choose Sword first, Rod second. But, there are other good choices.First time players should choose the Shield and discard the sword. The otherchoice gives you the best stats overall, supposedly. For this one, choose theStaff and discard the shield. Whatever your choices, after you make them, theplatform falls away and you fall onto a second platform that has Cinderella onit. This is your first encounter with a SHADOW. Ooh, scary. Just do what thetutorial tells you and swing at the Shadows for all it's worth. (1 Exp, each tobe exact.) After you've defeated them all, you fall down to a third platformthat has a transparent door on it. EXAMINE the door and follow the tutorialonce again. After this part of the tutorial, go through the door and now it'stime for a little Q&A and revisiting old friends. This part of the tutorialaffects how quickly you level up during the game, and this is how.To level up...Fast: Choose the top 3 answers each time. The downside is, when you get aroundlevels 60-100, it takes alot of EXP to gain a level. It also takes about960,000 EXP total to reach level 100.Normal: Choose the middle 3 answers each time. This will give you a normallevel up pace, with no major downside. You need about 900,000 EXP total toreach level 100.Slow: Choose the bottom 3 answers each time. The downside is, it takes alotmore EXP than usual to reach level 70. The upside is, it takes 120,000 EXP lesstotal to each level 100 and when you get to level 70, you start to level upquicker. Meaning, you only have to gain about 840,000 EXP total to reach level100.Selphie- \"What's most important to you?\"Being number one.Friendship.My prize possesions.Tidus- \"What are you so afraid of?\"Getting old.Being different.Being indecisive.Wakka- \"What do you want outta life?\"To see rare sights.To broaden my horizons.To be strong.After you've made your choices, you fade away to a fourth platform with Auroraon it. You now must fight 8 Shadows at once, piece of the proverbial cakeeveryone. Waste 'em. You should level up right here, depending on how youanswered the questions. (Congrats!) After the fight, you can make your firstgame save. Run up the ramp to the 5th and final platform (It has Belle on it)and get ready for your first BOSS fight.BOSS FIGHT: DarksideHP: 240 HPEXP GAINED: 18 XPITEMS DROPPED: NoneHe looks big, but, he isn't even close to being strong. Darkside has 2 moves hedoes in turn. First, he clenches dark power in his right first and then punchesthe ground, spawning 4 Shadows. Watch out for the punch though, it takes out1/5 of your life bar. This is a good chance to level up a second, and if youhave the patience, a third time. Just destroy the Shadows, don't do any severedamage to Darkside, and he'll keep spawning them! His second move is kneeling,drawing dark power to his heartshape on his stomach and then shooting outhoming lasers. When he does this, go behind him and hide between his legs, thelasers can't hit you then. Or, instead of hiding between his legs, stand infront of him and when the lasers come near you, hit them back at Darkside forsome Tech Points. Strike at his hands or at his head when he kneels and you'llput him out fast. If you get low on health, don't use your potion, just waitfor him to spawn Shadows, kill them and then collect the green health orbs.CUTSCENE3.2 Destiny IslandsMy Level: 3After the cutscene ends, talk to Kairi (the girl in front of you). She'll giveyou a search 'n' find quest for...2 Logs: One is under the bridge and the other one is on the island with Riku onit. (You can get to the island by swimming out to the water, or going up thestairs inside the Seaside Shack and crossing the bridge.1 Cloth: Starting from the Seaside Shack, go up the ramp by the shack and headup the second ramp, take a left. When you get to the fork in the path, go upthe stairs (they're on the right) and go around that path. Head up the ladderand follow this path. Head into the alcove and on the wall there is a cloth.1 Rope: Starting from the Seaside Shack, go up the ramp by the shack and headup the second ramp, take a left. When you get to the fork in the path, go upthe ladder. You should see Tidus practicing with a sword, behind him is therope.Don't ask for any help from Kairi and you'll be rewarded with a Hi-Potion afteryou complete the search and find. Now, before you head back to Kairi, this is agood chance to gain a level or two. Note: I call the following fights bossfights because they are stronger than regular enemies.Save your game in the seaside shack before you do any of the following.BOSS FIGHT: Wakka (Optional)HP: Unknown.EXP GAINED: 1 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Here's the  first thing you do. Jump up to the platform to your right, and LIFTthe barrel. Lock onto Wakka and THROW the barrel at him. He should be stunnedright now. While he's stunned, run up and get a quick 1-2-3 combo on him. Now,keep a close eye on him and strike right after he throws his blitzball. That'sit. Save and then go challenge Selphie.BOSS FIGHT: Selphie (Optional)HP: Unknown.EXP GAINED: 1 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Here's the  first thing you do. Jump up to the platform to your right, and LIFTthe barrel. Lock onto Selphie and THROW the barrel at her. She should bestunned right now. While she's stunned, run up and get a quick 1-2-3 combo onher. Selphie is mostly vunerable from the air, so jump up towards her andswipe, most likely, you'll hit her swing and get a Tech point (which is just anXP) and knock her back a little. Save and go fight Tidus.BOSS FIGHT: Tidus (Optional)HP: UnknownEXP GAINED: 2 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Here's the  first thing you do. Jump up to the platform to your right, and LIFTthe barrel. Lock onto Tidus and THROW the barrel at him. He should be stunnedright now. While he's stunned, run up and get a quick 1-2-3 combo on him. Now,Tidus is a little tricker than Selphie and Wakka. Tidus is a close rangefighter, so when he runs in at you, jump behind him and swipe at him with your1-2-3 combo. If you need to heal, remember, you have your potion (if you didn'tuse it already) left over from the AWAKENING.BOSS FIGHT: Wakka, Selphie, and Tidus. (Optional)HP: UnknownEXP GAINED: 4 XP (1 for Wakka, 1 for Selphie, and 2 for Tidus.)ITEMS DROPPED/WON: PotionHere's the first thing you do. Jump up to the platform to your right, and LIFTthe barrel. Lock onto whoever's closest and THROW the barrel at them. Theyshould be stunned right now. While they're stunned, run up and get a quick1-2-3 combo on them. After that, focus mainly on Tidus and Selphie first. Thosetwo tend to stay right by each other so you'll most likely be hitting them bothat the same time. After those two are done, finish off Wakka. (He's probablytaken a hit or two by now anyways.) Individual strategies for these 3 are thesame as above.BOSS FIGHT: Riku (Optional)HP: UnknownEXP GAINED: 5 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: PotionQuick note: This fight factors into your foot-race score, so if you lose, yourscore drops and will probably end up making Riku get the raft (and yourGummi-Ship) be named what Riku wants. This is probably the harder than the 3 on1 fight with Tidus & company. The trees get in the way, and if Riku falls ondown, he gets up by kicking forward, so don't stand in front of him after hefalls down. Also, don't fall off the island, or you'll lose. Without thebenefit of stunning him with a barrel, you're on your own. Riku likes to jumparound alot, so, you should stay on the ground whenever possible. Riku fallsdown after every 3 or 4 hits, so get ready to run to the side or jump behindhim. The best thing to do is hit him twice, run away, hit him twice and runaway.When you're ready, save and bring the stuff to Kairi. When asked to rest, sayyes.CUTSCENECUTSCENEDuring the second day, you have to explore the \"Secret Place\" (a cave by thewaterfall that's by the shack.) have a race with Riku, and do a second searchand find quest. Let's get started. You start the second day on the docks. Headback to where you gave Kairi the stuff and go through the door she was blockingbefore. (Now, if you want to level up a few more times, you can fight the 3 on1 fight again, or the single fights. Wakka has moved to the waterfall and Tidusis now where you fought Riku.) Riku is right by the door you just came through.When you talk to him, he asks you for a name for your raft (and ultimately, itturns out to be the name of your Gummi-Ship). He thinks it should be calledHighwind. You think it should be called Excalibur (or whatever you personallywant.) Anyways, instead of solving it normally, Sora and Riku decide to race.Here's what you have to do. Race through an obstacle course and touch a Paopufruit on the otherside, then, race back. Instead of taking the bridge likeRiku, just jump off the ledge, and race down through the water towards thestairs. Go up the stairs and go straight off that ledge. Run around the RIGHTside of the (your) raft and up the slope that curves left. Next, jump from eachplatform towards the paopu tree. Tag the tree and jump right off that platformback down to the beach. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GO THROUGH THE CAVE ENTRANCE BYTHE PAOPU TREE, IT'LL MAKE YOU LOSE THE RACE. Go back the way you came, aroundthe right side of the raft, jump up the ledge, race down the stairs, throughthe water, jump up the next ledge and you're done. What do you get? The raft isnamed whatever you wanted and you get a Pretty Stone. (The only use I've foundfor the Pretty Stone is selling it for 30 Munnies once you get to TraverseTown.) Wanna get your first Accessory? Go back to the stairs you raced onagainst the wall directly behind the box there is a cave, LIFT the box andcarry it towards the wall. THROW the box and climb on top of it. Jump into thecave. Inside the cave, there is a Protect Chain, which will raise your Def.stat by 1 point. Kairi is down by the raft now, go talk to her for your nextsearch and find quest. Looks like you're collecting provisions for yourupcoming trip! Here's what to find and where to find it.1 Seagull Egg- Head back to the Seaside Shack (chance to save) and go up thestairs inside. Climb up the thin tree and jump over to the tree that has theegg on it.3 Mushrooms- A. Secret Place by the doorway.CUTSCENE			B. By the raft, there is a rock blocking a cave. Push the rock out of theway and inside is the second mushroom.		      	C. To the left of the tower on the obstacle course in some grass.2 Coconuts- Just strike at all the palm trees and eventually, a yellow coconutshould fall down. Do this twice, but not on the same tree.3 Fish- Go to the boat dock and walk/swim around in the water. You should seefish swimming around, just walk through them and you should collect them.1 Bottle of Drinking Water (But, not ocean water!)- Go to the waterfall by theSecret Place and just go under the waterfall to collect it. You're done! Lastchance to save for a little bit. Last chance to get some XP from Tidus andeveryone. Once you're done, head back and talk to Kairi. If your do the questwithout asking for her help, you get another Hi-Potion.CUTSCENECUTSCENEWhen you get back to the main island, you find Riku and Kairi's boats alreadylanded on the island, and your old friends--Shadows. Your wooden sword doesnothing right now, just run to the little island where you fought Riku. (If youdid.) If you want to, you can save.CUTSCENENow, that you have the Keyblade, you can destroy the Shadows. I recommend beingat least level 5 before you face the boss, although I usually train up to level6 or 7. It'll also help alot when you get to Traverse Town if you're level 7.After the cutscene with Riku, go to the Secret Place.CUTSCENECUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: DarksideHP: 300 HPEXP GAINED: 60 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.He looks big, but, he isn't even close to being strong. Darkside has 4 movesnow, and he does each in turn. First, he kneels, drawing dark power to hisheartshape on his stomach and then shooting out homing lasers. When he doesthis, go behind him and hide between his legs, the lasers can't hit you then.Second, he clenches dark power in his right first and then punches the ground,spawning 4 Shadows. Watch out for the punch though, it takes out 1/5 of yourlife bar. His third is striking with his left hand straight into the groundcausing a mini-earthquake that will slightly damage you no matter where youare, but, if you jump,you can evade the hit. His final move is when he pullshis arm out of the ground. He pulls an energy orb with his arm. He raises theorb above his head and it starts raining small energy orbs and they hurt alittle. To finish him off strike at his hands or at his head when he kneels andyou'll put him out fast. If you get low on health, use your potions or justwait for him to spawn Shadows, kill them and then collect the green healthorbs.CUTSCENE3.3 TRAVERSE TOWN Part 1My Level: 7After waking up, you find Pluto staring right into your face. Welcome toTraverse Town, boys and girls, get ready for a ride. Head out of the alleywayand head into the Accessory Shop. Be ready to see a familar face. It's Cid fromFF7! Talk to him and then save. There is an treasure chest on a shelf. Jumponto the counter then onto the shelf and get the Mythril Shard. Head back outto the streets and go around back from the shop you were just in. Go throughthe big doors and go to the 2nd District.CUTSCENETime to fight again, but this time it's just Shadows again, but now they dropmunnie, along with health orbs. Destroy them and then head back to theAccessory Shop. But wait! The 1st District is overrun by Shadows! Finish themquickly. You shouldn't have the slightest problem with Shadows by now. Now, gointo the shop and save, then leave. Get ready to meet an old friend.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: Leon (Squall)HP: 120 HPEXP GAINED: 30 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.First of all, Leon is extremely agile, and it doesn't matter if you win or losethis fight, either way, the story continues. But, if you win, you get some XPwhich you need desperately this early in the game. (Well, it's considered alotthis early in the game.) Leon likes to shoot fireballs and then come in andstrike at you. But, the gunblade attacks are slow, so you can avoid themeasily. If you jump at him, chances are he'll jump back to evade and then swipeat you. A good idea here: get outta that small area you start in and head outinto the open, you have more room to move and dodge this way. He is mostvunerable right after he shoots fireballs or right before he shoots fireballs.When he is charging the fireball, swing just as soon as the fire is launched.This will stun him. Run over and hit him till he revives. Right after he'sswung do a 3 hit combo, and then run away. Repeat as much as it takes.CUTSCENECUTSCENEAfter the cutscene, walk over to the table and open the chest. Then, save. Talkto both Yuffie and Leon and get ready for some more action.CUTSCENEYou now have a second enemy Heartless, the Soldier. They take twice as manyhits than the Shadows do before they are destroyed. For a little XP, go the wayLeon didn't go, defeat the Heartless, and then go the way Leon went. If youjump up to the balcony that is reachable and then head over to the otherbalcony, you can get a potion. Head around the other corner of the hotel, pastthe double doors you're supposed to go through to pick up another potion, thenhead through the double doors. You should yourself at a fountain, if not, youwent through the wrong door. Defeat all the Heartless and then take the firstalleyway on the right from the fountain. Once in the alley, turn the nextcorner and keep fighting and then go through the door straight ahead that leadsto the 3rd District. Head to the stairs to your right.CUTSCENEDonald and Goofy are in your party now and with them, this fight is over prettyfast, but now, you've angered someone and you have to deal with...CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: Guard ArmorHP: 700 HPEXP GAINED: UnknownITEMS DROPPED/WON: Brave Warrior, 100 munny, Elixir, Magic Spell Fire, AbilityDodge Roll.Just strike at all the body parts, starting with the arms and then legs. Afteryou deal a certain amount of damage, the body breaks up and the pieces doindividual attacks, but they reform after awhile. When you destroy a part,health orbs appear, but if you need health, you should have a potion or twoequipped in your item menu. Don't bother healing Donald or Goofy, they takecare of themselves pretty good, and they even heal you if you really need it. Agood strategy is just focus on one body part at a time.CUTSCENENow, time to do a little more business in Traverse Town. headback to the 3rdDistrict and unlock the door that leads to the 1st District. Then, head downthe alley directly behind you from the door and you'll end up at a door with aflame on it. Use your new fire magic to unlock it. Head through the door andthen time your jumps just right so you can leap from floating rock to floatingrock. Then, go around the left side of the house to enter it.CUTSCENENow, you meet the house's resident: Merlin. After he returns his house tonormal, save and then use the save point to go to your Gummi-Ship. You now havea little Gummi-Ship tutorial to go through. After that head to Wonderland. (Theupper path.)3.4 WONDERLANDMy Level: 9CUTSCENEAfter you disembark, you find yourself floating down a shaft. After you andDonald have a graceful landing, and Goofy falls on his face, you regain controlof Sora. (I've always wanted to say this...!) Follow the White Rabbit. Gothrough the door at the end of the hallway.CUTSCENECUTSCENEGo up and talk to the doorknob. Yes, you heard me, talk to the doorknob!CUTSCENEAfter the talk, go over to the bed and push it, then, go over to the table anddrink the drink to shrink. As soon as you're shrunk, jump onto the floor, butwatch out! Heartless appear! A new enemy: Red Nocturne. Don't use fire magic onthem because they'll just absorb the magic and turn it into health forthemselves.NOTE: I will no longer be telling the whereabouts of items in chests, there arefar too many and some are too difficult to explain where they are hidden. But,once you see the chests for yourself you can find the way to them yourselves.After the Heartless are destroyed, go through the doorway you opened when youpushed the bed.CUTSCENEAfter the cutscene, the Queen of Hearts tells you to find evidence of Alice'sinnocence. All you have to do is find up to 4 pieces of evidence. Anothersearch and find quest, fun. Here's where the evidence is located. Becarefulthough, Heartless are swarming the area! Before you can start finding theevidence, you must first go through the doorway to the left of the throne.There is also a save point to the left of the entrance of the Queen's Castle.Footprints: Once you enter Lotus Forest, go forward and take a right into thefirst thicket of bushes, you should see a Blue Trinity Mark and to the rightand in front of it you should see a box containing this evidence.Antenna: From the entrance to Lotus Forest, go start through the trees ahead.You should see 3 tall mushrooms, jump onto the lower one, and then to the oneon the right. Jump up to the next platform and there is another box withevidence.Stench: From the small mushroom in the last location, jump left instead ofright from the small mushroom. Jump to the leaf platform and you should seeanother leaf across a gap. It may not look like it, but you can make this jump,so just jump across, if you don't make it, just keep trying and you will. Tryto get a running headstart and then jump right at the edge of the gap. Jump upto the treetop that has the red jellybean thing on it and then jump down to theleaf platform in front of the jellybean. Follow the curve of the leaves to theleft and up to the doorway and go through. You should find yourself in theBizarre Room again, but you'll be falling from the ceiling and will land on thestove, right next to the evidence box.Claw Marks: From the entrance to Lotus Forest, you should see a Yellow Floweron the left. Give the Flower a potion through the command menu. It will makeyou big again. Go over to the big tree and target it. Hit it once. Then, goover to the big tree stump by the entrance. Then, target the jellybean thing.Turns out, it was just a fruit. PICK the fruit then EAT it. Now, from the smallmushroom in the last location, jump left instead of right from the smallmushroom. Jump to the leaf platform and you should see another leaf across agap. It may not look like it, but you can make this jump, so just jump across,if you don't make it, just keep trying and you will. Try to get a runningheadstart and then jump right at the edge of the gap. Jump up to the treetopthat has the red jellybean thing on it and then jump down to the leaf platformin front of the jellybean. Follow the curve of the leaves to the right and gothrough the doorway. You should land on a water faucet. Look in the directionGoofy is looking. See the box? Aw...but it looks so far away! Just jump andhope you make it, if you don't keep trying. Again, a running start helps. Afteryou collect all 4 evidence pieces, the Cheshire Cat appears again and teachesyou Blizzard magic.Now you can save Alice, head back to the Queen's Castle and save. Then approachthe Queen's guards by her podium and give them the evidence. What!? The Queenis just a little off, don'tcha think? Oh well, if you want to keep your head,choose one. I don't think it matters which one you choose, as far as I know,this guessing game is rigged in your favor. After you choose the box, it showsthat the Heartless tried to steal the Queen's heart, but she still doesn'tbelieve you.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: The Queen of Hearts and the Army of CardsHP: Varies.EXP GAINED: 100 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.First off, don't attack the cards, Donald and Goofy seem to have apreoccupation with taking them out. Attack the Queen first to knock her out,then head for the tower. There are 3 cranks and this is what you have to attackto win the boss fight. An easy way to take care of the cranks is to just havefull magic and use all of it against the cranks, if you run out and still needto destroy cranks, when a crank is destroyed, it releases MP bubbles or you canattack the cards. Every now and then the Queen will revive, go over and knockher down again, then go back to attacking the Tower and cranks. After it'sdemolished, a cutscene starts.You have to find Alice and the kidnappers! Save really quick and then head backinto Lotus Forest.CUTSCENEGet ready for a new enemy: Large Body. This guy is only vunerable from behind,so dodge around him and make your attack. When he glows and slaps his stomach,run away and let Donald and Goofy take this blow. After that's done with, headstraight through the forest, following the path and then go through the doorwayat the end. You'll end up in the Tea Party Garden. (Sit down in all the chairsfor some neat items. But, if you sit in the wrong chair, Heartless appear. Toget the table back, exit the room and reenter.) Go through the door on theleft. What you have to do now is turn on the two lights. Just defeat theHeartless as they appear and then jump up to the lights and TOUCH them. Now, goback the way you came and go to the right-side-up Bizarre Room. Make sure yousave on the way through the Queen's Castle, because you have anotherBOSS FIGHT: Trick MasterHP: 600 HPEXP GAINED: 150 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: Ifrit's Horn, Navi-Gummi Piece.He looks tricky, but he isn't. Still, I recommend being at least level 10before youre face him. If you need to level up, just go back to Lotus Forest.To finish Trick Master off, just keep using fire magic and when that runs out,jump up and attack him. Eventually, he'll start to droop, making it easierbecause you don't have to jump to attack him anymore. But, after awhile, he'llstand again. After a certain amount of damage, he'll walk around the room, ifyou have to, jump on top of the table and then leap at him. But, if you staycamped out on the table, he'll bat the table down into the ground, taking youradvantage away, it will return to normal after a few seconds though. When hestarts his pins on fire, cast Blizzard on them, that way you won't take anyextra damage. Keep this pattern up and he'll fold in no time. Now, you'll sealyour first \"Keyhole.\"CUTSCENEOnce you return to your Gummi-Ship, fly counter-clockwise around the ring. (Youhave to make a pit-stop at Traverse Town, but you don't have to disembark. But,this is a good chance to gain and level or two before you continue on toOlympus Coliseum.3.5 OLYPMUS COLISEUM PART 1My Level: 14All Olympus consists of is just this one Coliseum. Head straight through thebig doors in front of you. Once inside go up and talk to Phil.CUTSCENETry to move the pedistal. When you say \"It weighs a ton!\" Go back and talk toPhil again.CUTSCENESave, then talk to Phil again. You now have to go through 2 trials.TRIAL 1Barrels: 20Time Limit: 30 SecondsRun foward, hit the three barrels till they break. Run to the next group, ifthere are any left. if not, jump up to the next group and strike them. Finishoff any remaining barrels with Fire, Blizzard, or normal strikes.TRIAL 2Barrels: 25Time Limit: 1 MinuteFirst off, run around to the left, strike the barrels, turn around the corner,LIFT the single barrel, target the barrel along this straight part, THROW it atthe single barrel, run around the next corner and you're almost at where youstarted. There is 2 barrels stacked on top of each other and a single barrel.Target the single and rotate the camera around so the you and the single barrelface the stacked barrels. Strike until the barrel flys at the stacked ones.Jump up to the next set, break them with Keyblade hits. Jump up to the nextlayer and there is a single barrel and 2 stacks of 2. Same plan as before.Finish the remaining barrels with hits. Jump up, another single and 3 stacks of2. Same plan as the last 2 sets. Finish the next barrel with your Keyblade andthen there is one left. It is on a platform in the air that you can't jump to,use fire magic.CUTSCENEREWARD: Magic Spell ThunderBut, Phil still won't let you in the games! Alright, forget him, leave thecoliseum.CUTSCENEOoh, what's this!? An Entry Pass! Go back and show Phil who's who! Be sure tosave your game when you reenter the coliseum. Now, it's time for thepreliminaries! Even though it's against my policy this early in the game, giveDonald and Goofy potions. (Have you customized their preferences yet? Set theirHP and MP items usage to \"Only in Emergancies\"!)PRELIMINARIES--7 SeedsMatch 1: Shadow Scout4x Soldiers3x Blue RhapsodiesUse fire against the Blue ones. This is simple stuff right here.CUTSCENE (Yeah, that's right, that's Cloud from FF7!)Match 2: Sinisters3x Blue Rhapsodies10x ShadowsFire against the Blue things, you should know how to handle Shadows by now!Match 3: Heat & Freeze5x Red Nocturne5x Blue RhapsodiesFire against the blue things, ice against the red. Make sure you know whichtype you're locked onto! If you've run out of magic, use normal hits.CUTSCENEMatch 4: Shadow Platoon3x Red Nocturne3x Blue Rhapsodies2x Shadows2x SoldiersTake care of the magic spitters first, then the Soldiers. Finish off theShadows last.Match 5: Blue Revenge10x Blue RhapsodiesNormal hits or fire magic.CUTSCENEMatch 6: Big One1x Large Body4x Red Nocturne4x Blue RhapsodiesGo after the Large Body first, and then finish the magic spitters off. DodgeRoll (You have it equipped, right?) around to avoid the Tummy Slap of Deaththing.Match 7: Final MatchBOSS FIGHT: CloudHP: 300 HPEXP GAINED: 80 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.First of all, you don't HAVE to win this fight. This is the same as the fightwith Leon, you can lose and still progress. But, for those of you who want tobeat Cloud down, here's what to do. Use normal attacks, he seems to be fireproof. Or you can use Blizzard and Thunder, but your MPs won't last long. Saveyour potions for you. Donald and Goofy (depending on how good you did) shouldstill have some left for themselves and you. You should still have all 3 ofyours. When he leaps up and then impales the ground, be sure to Dodge Roll outof the way. Cloud also likes to stab forwards while sliding, and then doing a 3hit combo. Just Dodge Roll out of the way. If you jump at Cloud to hit him fromthe air, he'll most likely jump back to avoid and possibly counterattack withthat slide/stab thing. If you can, strike at the same time as Cloud so youdeflect his attack. This causes him to stop and you can get a good combo in onhim. (Combo Plus, you have it equipped, right?) After you do alot of damage tohim. He changes his lunge attack. Instead of doing a 3 hit combo after thelunge, he does a 180 turn and then lunges again,180 turn and lunges again. Hedoes the lunge/180 thing 5 times. Just jump over his attacks the first 4 times.The 5th time, however. he slide/lunges and then 180's and jump/stabs theground. Dodge Roll this one. After you do enough damage, he does the jump/stabground thing repeatedly. Just keep Dodge Rolling and striking him when he pullshis sword out of the ground and he should be finished quickly.CUTSCENESave first, now you have a choice. A. Save Hercules or B. Run away and levelup. If you are level 15 or higher, you should be safe, if not, choose B. Eitherway, make sure you saved, make sure you reequip the 3 of you with HP and MPhealing items, and then do what you chose.If you choose to \"Go from Zero to HERO!\" you get aCUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: CerberusHP: 600HPEXP GAINED: 200 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: Inferno Band, Hero License, Ability Sonic Blade.Let Donald and Goofy do most of the damage until they get K.O.'d. Watch out forCerberus's bites, they do alot of damage. Dodge Roll around and jump at theheads. Use Thunder magic to cause a lot of damage. Cerberus shoots meteors outof it's mouths, so be sure to Dodge Roll or jump over them. A good tactic is toget behind Cerberus and then try to jump onto it's right heal and then ontoit's back. Run up it's back and then Lock-On and strike the heads. WhenCerberus rears up and slams it's paws on the ground be sure to jump the secondbefore the paws hit. When Cerberus shoots dark energy into the ground, DodgeRoll around to avoid the energy pillars that crash out of the ground or jumponto it's back.CUTSCENEOnce that's over, go back inside, save and then leave. Wait, is that... Cloudon the steps there by the exit...?CUTSCENENow, leave for real this time.CUTSCENEIf you want, head back to Traverse Town. Personally, I always take a trip backto Traverse Town and make one run through the 2nd District, Hotel, Gizmo Shop,and 3rd District for some XP. If you go to the Item Shop, you can buy some newweapons for Donald and Goofy. This is also a good chance to level up. Whateveryou do, the next level is...3.6 DEEP JUNGLEMy Level: 17NOTE: DURING THIS LEVEL, SABOR, THE LEOPARD, WILL RANDOMLY APPEAR AT TIMES. ASFAR AS I KNOW, THERE IS NO SET PATERN FOR HIS APPEARENCES OTHER THAN THEY TENDTO HAPPEN AFTER A CUTSCENE. I AM PUTTING IN WHERE I HAVE SEEN HIM APPEAR. YOUMIGHT NOT NECESSARILY SEE HIM AT THE SAME SPOT THAT I DO.What's this!? You and Donald fight over the controls for the Gummi-Ship, youwant to check out the jungle for Riku and Kairi, but he doesn't think that theKing is there. The Gummi-Ship crash lands on Deep Jungle.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: SaborHP: 90 HPEXP GAINED: 15 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Again, Fire magic is your best friend. Lock on and shoot the fire till your MPsrun out, then switch to sword hits. When you build your MP back up, use Fireagain. Sabor likes to jump around and then follow up with a claw swipe or two.So, just stay on the ground during the jump and then Dodge Roll away.CUTSCENEFirst thing you want to do is change Tarzan's preferences to what I recommendedearlier. (HP and MP items used only in an emergancy.) Then, if you want to,(This is what I usually do.) steal all of Tarzan's items and accessories. but,you don't have to, it's just fun and gets you some neat stuff sometimes. Now,just jump off the same way Tarzan did. Now, you have a chance to save the game,either jump down the tree trunk and \"surf\" down the tree branches like from themovie or, jump up the two platforms. If you choose the tree trunk, you'll endup at the camp site right away, then just head into the tent. If you choose togo through the doorway by the platforms, go through the door, through the nextdoor, now from the platform you're on, jump down to the next level and falldown the hole to your right. Then, just jump off that tree top and you'll landin some water. Swim to the ramp and go on that platform and head in thedirection you were facing when you appeared in this room. Now, take the door onthe left and you'll end up at the camp site. Enter the tent.CUTSCENESave your game and talk to Jane. Oops! She lost the slides, guess you have tosearch and find them! Here's the locations.Slide 1: On top of the tent with Jane in it. Beside it is a globe and someboxes. Jump onto the boxes and then onto the tent. It's laying right in thecenter of the tent and you can't miss it.Slide 2: From the top of the tent, jump off into the little clearing surroundedby tents, on a green dresser there is a slide.Slide 3: This one is by the art easel, which is to the right of the boxes youused to jump up onto the tent.Slide 4: On top of the huge stack of boxes in the middle of the area. (If youcan somehow miss this pile, it is directly in front of the tent.)Slide 5: Go back to where you found slide 1, jump onto the long stretch oftents, it is in the middle of the very last tent.Slide 6: Behind the globe on the boxes you used to jump up to slide 1.Once you have collected them all. head back into the tent and save. Then,EXAMINE the projector.CUTSCENEGet the feeling Mr. Clayton is up to something? Me too... Oh well, make sureyou have Goofy and Tarzan in your party. Donald is usless right none basicallybecause he has such weak HP. After this is set up, save again if you want andthen leave the tent. But, as soon as you get outside...BOSS FIGHT: SaborHP: 90 HPEXP GAINED: 15 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Again, Fire magic is your best friend. Lock on and shoot the fire till your MPsrun out, then switch to sword hits. When you build your MP back up, use Fireagain. Sabor likes to jump around and then follow up with a claw swipe or two.So, just stay on the ground during the jump and then Dodge Roll away. Betweenthe three of you, Sabor shouldn't last more than 30 seconds.After Sabor runs away again, tail between legs, go around the lab table and outthat doorway. Now there are two ways you can go again. The easiest is thesecond, because the vine rope jumping is a huge pain, so I won't even botherexplaining that part and I'll just go with the easy path. From where you enterthe Hippo's Lagoon area, turn right and jump onto the first hippo, then over tothe grass. Go to the right of that platform and jump across onto the nextplatform. Turn left a little and you should see another platform, jump to itthen turn left again, you should se a small tree, jump on top of it, then upanother tree top, and then finally a third. Jump down onto the platform (ordirectly to the hippos back) and then jump onto the little island with atreasure chest on it. Climb up this vine.CUTSCENENow, head back to the tree house. A quick way back to the tree house is this:once the cinema ends, turn to the left and you should see a vine, climb it andyou should be in a room called Climbing Trees. Follow the path around and jumpto the platform across from you. If you are on the right platform, you shouldsee a blueTrinity mark on it. Go through the door behind the Trinity mark.CUTSCENENow, head back to the campsite, using the same path you did the first time.But, when you get back to the campsite...BOSS FIGHT: SaborHP: 90 HPEXP GAINED: 15 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Again, Fire magic is your best friend. Lock on and shoot the fire till your MPsrun out, then switch to sword hits. When you build your MP back up, use Fireagain. Sabor likes to jump around and then follow up with a claw swipe or two.So, just stay on the ground during the jump and then Dodge Roll away. Betweenthe three of you, Sabor shouldn't last more than 30 seconds.After the fight with Sabor, head into the tent again.CUTSCENESave the game and go see what Clayton fired at!CUTSCENE (But a very short one!)Quick defeat those new monkey Heartless to save the gorilla! Now it's time togo to an area that you haven't been to yet. The Bamboo Thicket. Leaving thetent, take a right and head into the Bamboo. Another group of Heartless! Goodjob, you saved another gorilla, head through to the next room. More Heartless,finish them to save another gorilla. Now, head back to camp. Finish off anyHeartless you encounter along the way. You probably will have another encounterin the Bamboo Thicket and after you destroy the first wave of Heartless, you'llface a second wave with another new enemy: Power Wild. (The other monkey thingis a Bouncy Wild.) Be sure to save when you get back to camp. When you exit thetent, you might encounter a mushroom thing that is white with a red hat. DO NOTATTACK THEM. Pay attention to what they do. If you play their little game ofcharades 3 times, you'll get some cool items. Right now though, you can only do3 magic spells so cast a certain magic on them after they do a certain thing.Thunder: A light above it's head.Blizzard: On their knees begging.Fire: Shivering.And for later on...Cure: Laying down on the ground.Aero: Spinning in circles.Stop: They don't move.Gravity: Floating in the air.Now, after the mushrooms, head to the Treetop room again. (The room you wentthrough to get to the tree house.) When you get to the tree top room, you haveto fight more Heartless. Another gorilla saved. Head to the tree house. Onceinside the tree house, another fight commences and another gorilla is saved.Head back to camp, head into the tent, save, and then leave.CUTSCENEHead off into the thicket again. (The direction of the gunshot.)CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: SaborHP: 180 HPEXP GAINED: 150 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: White Fang.Ooh, Sabor's back and he has some more HP now...oh well, use fire again tostart off. Once it runs out, go in close and attck relentlessly. Sabor likes tojump around and then follow up with a claw swipe or two. So, just stay on theground during the jump and then Dodge Roll away. After you hit him enough,he'll jump into the trees and you'll lose your lock on. Just wait for him toreappear, which is usually on the otherside of the thicket. He also has a newattack. He headbutt lunges at you. Just jump when you see him lower his head.CUTSCENEThat is the last time you have to worry about Sabor. But, hurry! Get back tocamp and check on Jane! Take care of any Heartless in the area and then headinside the tent.CUTSCENESave quickly and run back to the treetop area where you can get to the treehouse. But, when you get to the tree top area, you find Jane and the gorillacaptive! Just destroy the big black fruit because the Heartless just keeprespawning if you don't. Head back to the campsite again once you're done.Destroy any Heartless and then head inside the tent. Save your game and thenhead to the thicket. Once there, head into the area after it. (The Cliff area.)NOTE: You may encounter Heartless in the thicket, if you do, use a Tent,Cottage or Camping Set to heal yourself.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: ClaytonHP: 250 HPEXP GAINED: None.ITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Clayton has a group of Heartless that you'll wanna take care of first. Claytonjust LOVES to heal himself after you do any damage to him, so you'll have to bequick. Also, his shotgun does alot of damage, depending on how close you are tohim. But, he stops after every 3 shots to reload or use a potion. He will alsoswing his gun around and strike you with it. Do not use any magic on him yet,you'll need it later.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: Stealth Sneak and ClaytonHP: Stealth Sneak: 750 HP Clayton: 250 HPEXP GAINED: Stealth Sneak: 30 XP if first defeated, 240 XP if second defeated.Clayton: 30 XP if first defeated, 240 XP if second defeated.ITEMS DROPPED/WON: Magic Spell Cure, Navi-G Piece, Jungle King, Red Trinity.To get to Clayton, you must first knock him off his mount. Target the StealthSneak and use fire magic on him. (You listened to me when I told you to saveit, right?) Now, Clayton shoots from his mount (till he falls) and then, theStealth Sneak also shoots twin lasers out of it's hands and twing homing lasersout of it's eyes. When the two seperate, go for the Stealth Sneak first, thenfinish Clayton off. Stealth Sneak will also headbutt you, this is a pain whentrying to heal and you get interuppted.CUTSCENEHead up into the cave and make your way upwards by jumping from platform toplatform. Once you reach the top, go through the top cave entrance. Now, you'llseal your second \"Keyhole\".CUTSCENECUTSCENECUTSCENE(Yeah, that's alot of cutscenes.)You heard Donald and Goofy! Head back to Traverse Town and talk to Leon!3.7 Traverse Town Part 2My Level: 20Once you're back in Traverse Town, head to the 2nd District's Hotel. Go intothe Green Room and exit through the back door. If you want, before you gothrough into the Hotel, spend some time and level up in the 2nd District andthe Gizmo Shop. Also, if you've collected any of the 101 Dalmations, you shouldcheck out Pongo and Perdita's house in the back alley of the 2nd District. Ifyou decide to level up a little, becareful, there are alot of Large Bodies inTraverse Town now. There are also 3 new enemies. Yellow Opera, Green Requiemand Air Soldier. They are fairly strong, especially the Green Requiem. Whilethey never attack, they do use CURE and when they use Cure on a Large Body, itcan do a whole lot of damage. When you're ready, head to the right when you getout in the alley behind the hotel and go to the barred doorway. There is a RedTrinity right by it, use it and then go into the door. Swim through the channeland talk to Leon. After he tells you about sealing the Keyholes, talk to himagain. Ooh, you got a pretty little gem...better head up those stairs behindyou so you can find Cid. When you get to the top of the stairs, you'll see aplatform, jump onto it and you'll appear in the Merlin's House. Head out ofMerlin's house and go to the 3rd District. Take care of any Heartless here andthen go through the doors leading to the 1st District. Go into the AccessoryShop and talk to Cid about the Gummi Block. Save the game while you're heretoo.CUTSCENEHmm...something's going on at the Gizmo Shop, eh? Well...deliver the book toMerlin first, then we'll go exploring! Oh! How about that? Done and done. Youmade the delivery and even got a summon spell out of it! What luck! Head backto the 3rd District now, you know that small abandoned house? Well, Cid, Leon,Yuffie, and Aerith have all taken residence up in there. Drop in and say hi.But, you're interupted before you can get to the house.CUTSCENENow, that's odd...Riku disappeared on ya...oh well, it had to have beenimportant. Now, head to house you were going to before. Go over and talk toCid.CUTSCENENow, leave that cozy lil house and head to the 1st District and save your game,now head to the 2nd District's Gizmo Shop. Fight through all the Heartless(There's around 5 waves of Heartless) and then exit the Gizmo shop through thedoor on the other side of the room. Climb the ladder to the left and you're onthe roof. Use Red Trinity on the boards and PULL on the bell 3 times. What'sthis!? A keyhole, right here in Traverse Town! Just like Leon said!CUTSCENEMaybe you should try to seal it...might want to head back to the 1st Districtand save though...(Make sure you go through the 3rd District or stay on theupper walkway if you do though because...)BOSS FIGHT: Opposite ArmorHP: 1200 HPEXP GAINED: 390 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: Magic Spell Aero, Navi-G Piece.For the first few strikes, it attacks you as Guard Armor, so use the sametactics as last time, but, after a you do a certain amount of damage, it turnsinto Opposite Armor. Just Dodge Roll when it tries to use it's Stomach lasercannon. When the pieces fall apart, go after the legs first, then the arms.When I say legs, I mean the things that he walks on now, not the actual legs.Same thing for the arms. Try to stay underneath the Armor to avoid most of thedamage. When the parts break, they drop a lot of health orbs, run and pick themup as fast as you can. Hopefully, you have Cure in your shortcut menu, cause ifnot, you're gonna die trying to heal yourself the long way. Use Thunder alot,but always make sure you have 1 MP left so you can heal yourself. Or you canuse potions, but I don't know if you guys have them equipped.After you beat him, you seal the Keyhole. Head back to the Accessory Shop andsave. But, when you get to the shop, the clerk is missing and someone issleeping on the floor!CUTSCENENow, you can save. Then, go to your new and improved Gummi-Ship. Ooh, but wait!There's a tournament being held at the Coliseum...and a great reward is beingoffered to the winner. Maybe you should go and level up there a little, eh? Forhelp beating the Phil Cup, check out the Side-Quests section of theFAQ/Walkthrough. So, if you want to compete now, scroll down, which I suggestyou do. After that, head to the WARP HOLE that is located after the Coliseum.Enter the hole (you'll have to use your warp drive to get to Olympus and thenselect the warp hole) and you're on your way to Agrabah.3.8 AGRABAHMy level: 24CUTSCENEAs soon as it ends, a new kind of Heartless attack. Just use normal attacks,and then head through the little wooden door to the left. Smash the barrels forsome munnies and then save. Head back to the Plaza and then go through the hugeopen doorway. One thing, the Shadows are tougher now. They cause more damage,and can take more. But, you also get more XP for defeating them. Another fightcommences, dispatch the Heartless. From the door way you entered from, take theright path, and then to the end of that path. To the right there is a pole,climb it. MOVE the dresser off of the carpet. Some treasue chests and a savepoint. If you should exit this room and return, there will be a manselling/buying items. Against the wall to the far right of the save point thereis another dresser, MOVE it and RELEASE the lock. Head out of the room usingthe open door. Ah! You're back in the Plaza, but on a higher level. Turn to theright from where you start and you should see some open windows with a woodenawning thing sticking out. Jump to the first one, then to the second, then ontothe solid ground quickly. Why? Because if you stay of those wooden awnings formore than 1 second, they fall off and you'll have to do it all over again.Remember that lock you released? It opened this gate here, go through it.Onceyou're back on Main Street, take the left path (the one you didn't take before)and go through that doorway.CUTSCENEUh-oh...before you can find Aladdin, you have to beat these Heartless, onceyou're done with that, jump onto the boxes in the left corner and up to thatplatform. RELEASE the lock and then turn to the right from the lock and youshould see some more open windows with awnings sticking out. Jump to the firstone, then to the second, then onto the solid ground quickly. Why? 			Kingdom Hearts Strategy Guide	The Destiny Islands are a beautiful paradise where children's laughterabounds.

Thank God that's all done. Ianswered some FAQ/Walkthroughs and put them in. Due to a couple of peoples'wild imaginations and their intent to see that this FAQ/Walkthrough is NEVER,EVER completed, they suggested that I put in the Ansem's reports. Instead ofposting each report like they are presented in the game, I've just posted allof them together, when a new report begins, the first word is CAPPED. I alsoadded a CHALLENGES!!! section. If you choose to take place in a challenge andyou want to let me know you completed it, please submit a gamesave so I can seeit. I am about to start my own challenge of going through the game on EXPERTtaking less than my old score of 2709 hits.

Iupdated those and when I did the Synthesis Items, I noticed my Item List waswrong. I incorrectly posted that there are Frost, Thunder, Blaze, Power andSpirit Crystals. There is no such items. I'm sorry for posting that. The thingis, no body noticed it but me!There are many ways to contact me, so if you need additional help, or you havesome corrections, or if ya just wanna say \"hello\" you can...just to warn youthough, I rarely check my Yahoo! email, if you absolutely email me, try toemail me at my Hotmail account.Email me at:cody_rs_2004@hotmail.comcody_rs_2004@yahoo.comMy Yahoo screen name is:cody_rs_2004My MSN screen name is:cody_rs_2004My AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) screen name is:CodyRS20042.

Thestrategy guide will work for the EXPERT setting, except for that enemies arealot stronger, dealing around twice as much damage as their NORMAL settingcounterparts do.One more note, if I use caps for something (Example: TAKE, PICK, ARCANUM,STRIKE.) This means it is a command you use in the command menu, it will appearas the bottom option.3.1 AWAKENINGMy Level: 1CUTSCENEAfter a slightly confusing opening cinema and my favorite song, you takecontrol of Sora who is standing on a green platform with a picture of SnowWhite and other characters from that movie. This a just a tutorial for now, sofollow the commands as they are presented. Walk into the center of theplatform. Three pedistals are presented to you. The one on the left has ashield, the center has a sword, and the one on the right has a magic rod. Eachone represents a stat aspect. You are supposed to choose 2 objects. But,depending on whether it's your first choice or second will affect the statpositively or negatively, respectively. The object that you didn't choose isn'taffected at all, you will continue to gain more of it's attributes in a normalmanner. It is recommended that if this is your first time playing, you choosethe power of the guardian and discard the power of the mystic, although Ididn't and made it through just fine. Here's the laydown on what each objectdoes.The Dream Shield- The power of the guadian. Kindness to aid friends. A shieldto repel all. If you choose the Dream Shield for your first choice, yourdefense and HP will level up more frequently than other stats throughout thegame. You also start the game with higher defense. If it's your second choice,your defense and HP will level up less frequently than your other statsthroughout the game.The Dream Sword- The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword ofterrible destruction. If you choose the Dream Sword first, your offense willlevel up more frequently than your other stats, if you choose it second, yourstrength will level up less frequently than your other stats.The Dream Rod- The power of the mystic. Inner strength. A staff of wonder andruin. If you choose the Dream Rod first, your MP and AP will level up morefrequently than other stats throughout the game.You also start the game withhigher MP and AP. If you choose it second, your MP and AP will level up lessfrequently than your other stats.I usually choose Sword first, Rod second. But, there are other good choices.First time players should choose the Shield and discard the sword. The otherchoice gives you the best stats overall, supposedly. For this one, choose theStaff and discard the shield. Whatever your choices, after you make them, theplatform falls away and you fall onto a second platform that has Cinderella onit. This is your first encounter with a SHADOW. Ooh, scary. Just do what thetutorial tells you and swing at the Shadows for all it's worth. (1 Exp, each tobe exact.) After you've defeated them all, you fall down to a third platformthat has a transparent door on it. EXAMINE the door and follow the tutorialonce again. After this part of the tutorial, go through the door and now it'stime for a little Q&A and revisiting old friends. This part of the tutorialaffects how quickly you level up during the game, and this is how.To level up...Fast: Choose the top 3 answers each time. The downside is, when you get aroundlevels 60-100, it takes alot of EXP to gain a level. It also takes about960,000 EXP total to reach level 100.Normal: Choose the middle 3 answers each time. This will give you a normallevel up pace, with no major downside. You need about 900,000 EXP total toreach level 100.Slow: Choose the bottom 3 answers each time. The downside is, it takes alotmore EXP than usual to reach level 70. The upside is, it takes 120,000 EXP lesstotal to each level 100 and when you get to level 70, you start to level upquicker. Meaning, you only have to gain about 840,000 EXP total to reach level100.Selphie- \"What's most important to you?\"Being number one.Friendship.My prize possesions.Tidus- \"What are you so afraid of?\"Getting old.Being different.Being indecisive.Wakka- \"What do you want outta life?\"To see rare sights.To broaden my horizons.To be strong.After you've made your choices, you fade away to a fourth platform with Auroraon it. You now must fight 8 Shadows at once, piece of the proverbial cakeeveryone. Waste 'em. You should level up right here, depending on how youanswered the questions. (Congrats!) After the fight, you can make your firstgame save. Run up the ramp to the 5th and final platform (It has Belle on it)and get ready for your first BOSS fight.BOSS FIGHT: DarksideHP: 240 HPEXP GAINED: 18 XPITEMS DROPPED: NoneHe looks big, but, he isn't even close to being strong. Darkside has 2 moves hedoes in turn. First, he clenches dark power in his right first and then punchesthe ground, spawning 4 Shadows. Watch out for the punch though, it takes out1/5 of your life bar. This is a good chance to level up a second, and if youhave the patience, a third time. Just destroy the Shadows, don't do any severedamage to Darkside, and he'll keep spawning them! His second move is kneeling,drawing dark power to his heartshape on his stomach and then shooting outhoming lasers. When he does this, go behind him and hide between his legs, thelasers can't hit you then. Or, instead of hiding between his legs, stand infront of him and when the lasers come near you, hit them back at Darkside forsome Tech Points. Strike at his hands or at his head when he kneels and you'llput him out fast. If you get low on health, don't use your potion, just waitfor him to spawn Shadows, kill them and then collect the green health orbs.CUTSCENE3.2 Destiny IslandsMy Level: 3After the cutscene ends, talk to Kairi (the girl in front of you). She'll giveyou a search 'n' find quest for...2 Logs: One is under the bridge and the other one is on the island with Riku onit. (You can get to the island by swimming out to the water, or going up thestairs inside the Seaside Shack and crossing the bridge.1 Cloth: Starting from the Seaside Shack, go up the ramp by the shack and headup the second ramp, take a left. When you get to the fork in the path, go upthe stairs (they're on the right) and go around that path. Head up the ladderand follow this path. Head into the alcove and on the wall there is a cloth.1 Rope: Starting from the Seaside Shack, go up the ramp by the shack and headup the second ramp, take a left. When you get to the fork in the path, go upthe ladder. You should see Tidus practicing with a sword, behind him is therope.Don't ask for any help from Kairi and you'll be rewarded with a Hi-Potion afteryou complete the search and find. Now, before you head back to Kairi, this is agood chance to gain a level or two. Note: I call the following fights bossfights because they are stronger than regular enemies.Save your game in the seaside shack before you do any of the following.BOSS FIGHT: Wakka (Optional)HP: Unknown.EXP GAINED: 1 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Here's the  first thing you do. Jump up to the platform to your right, and LIFTthe barrel. Lock onto Wakka and THROW the barrel at him. He should be stunnedright now. While he's stunned, run up and get a quick 1-2-3 combo on him. Now,keep a close eye on him and strike right after he throws his blitzball. That'sit. Save and then go challenge Selphie.BOSS FIGHT: Selphie (Optional)HP: Unknown.EXP GAINED: 1 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Here's the  first thing you do. Jump up to the platform to your right, and LIFTthe barrel. Lock onto Selphie and THROW the barrel at her. She should bestunned right now. While she's stunned, run up and get a quick 1-2-3 combo onher. Selphie is mostly vunerable from the air, so jump up towards her andswipe, most likely, you'll hit her swing and get a Tech point (which is just anXP) and knock her back a little. Save and go fight Tidus.BOSS FIGHT: Tidus (Optional)HP: UnknownEXP GAINED: 2 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Here's the  first thing you do. Jump up to the platform to your right, and LIFTthe barrel. Lock onto Tidus and THROW the barrel at him. He should be stunnedright now. While he's stunned, run up and get a quick 1-2-3 combo on him. Now,Tidus is a little tricker than Selphie and Wakka. Tidus is a close rangefighter, so when he runs in at you, jump behind him and swipe at him with your1-2-3 combo. If you need to heal, remember, you have your potion (if you didn'tuse it already) left over from the AWAKENING.BOSS FIGHT: Wakka, Selphie, and Tidus. (Optional)HP: UnknownEXP GAINED: 4 XP (1 for Wakka, 1 for Selphie, and 2 for Tidus.)ITEMS DROPPED/WON: PotionHere's the first thing you do. Jump up to the platform to your right, and LIFTthe barrel. Lock onto whoever's closest and THROW the barrel at them. Theyshould be stunned right now. While they're stunned, run up and get a quick1-2-3 combo on them. After that, focus mainly on Tidus and Selphie first. Thosetwo tend to stay right by each other so you'll most likely be hitting them bothat the same time. After those two are done, finish off Wakka. (He's probablytaken a hit or two by now anyways.) Individual strategies for these 3 are thesame as above.BOSS FIGHT: Riku (Optional)HP: UnknownEXP GAINED: 5 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: PotionQuick note: This fight factors into your foot-race score, so if you lose, yourscore drops and will probably end up making Riku get the raft (and yourGummi-Ship) be named what Riku wants. This is probably the harder than the 3 on1 fight with Tidus & company. The trees get in the way, and if Riku falls ondown, he gets up by kicking forward, so don't stand in front of him after hefalls down. Also, don't fall off the island, or you'll lose. Without thebenefit of stunning him with a barrel, you're on your own. Riku likes to jumparound alot, so, you should stay on the ground whenever possible. Riku fallsdown after every 3 or 4 hits, so get ready to run to the side or jump behindhim. The best thing to do is hit him twice, run away, hit him twice and runaway.When you're ready, save and bring the stuff to Kairi. When asked to rest, sayyes.CUTSCENECUTSCENEDuring the second day, you have to explore the \"Secret Place\" (a cave by thewaterfall that's by the shack.) have a race with Riku, and do a second searchand find quest. Let's get started. You start the second day on the docks. Headback to where you gave Kairi the stuff and go through the door she was blockingbefore. (Now, if you want to level up a few more times, you can fight the 3 on1 fight again, or the single fights. Wakka has moved to the waterfall and Tidusis now where you fought Riku.) Riku is right by the door you just came through.When you talk to him, he asks you for a name for your raft (and ultimately, itturns out to be the name of your Gummi-Ship). He thinks it should be calledHighwind. You think it should be called Excalibur (or whatever you personallywant.) Anyways, instead of solving it normally, Sora and Riku decide to race.Here's what you have to do. Race through an obstacle course and touch a Paopufruit on the otherside, then, race back. Instead of taking the bridge likeRiku, just jump off the ledge, and race down through the water towards thestairs. Go up the stairs and go straight off that ledge. Run around the RIGHTside of the (your) raft and up the slope that curves left. Next, jump from eachplatform towards the paopu tree. Tag the tree and jump right off that platformback down to the beach. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GO THROUGH THE CAVE ENTRANCE BYTHE PAOPU TREE, IT'LL MAKE YOU LOSE THE RACE. Go back the way you came, aroundthe right side of the raft, jump up the ledge, race down the stairs, throughthe water, jump up the next ledge and you're done. What do you get? The raft isnamed whatever you wanted and you get a Pretty Stone. (The only use I've foundfor the Pretty Stone is selling it for 30 Munnies once you get to TraverseTown.) Wanna get your first Accessory? Go back to the stairs you raced onagainst the wall directly behind the box there is a cave, LIFT the box andcarry it towards the wall. THROW the box and climb on top of it. Jump into thecave. Inside the cave, there is a Protect Chain, which will raise your Def.stat by 1 point. Kairi is down by the raft now, go talk to her for your nextsearch and find quest. Looks like you're collecting provisions for yourupcoming trip! Here's what to find and where to find it.1 Seagull Egg- Head back to the Seaside Shack (chance to save) and go up thestairs inside. Climb up the thin tree and jump over to the tree that has theegg on it.3 Mushrooms- A. Secret Place by the doorway.CUTSCENE			B. By the raft, there is a rock blocking a cave. Push the rock out of theway and inside is the second mushroom.		      	C. To the left of the tower on the obstacle course in some grass.2 Coconuts- Just strike at all the palm trees and eventually, a yellow coconutshould fall down. Do this twice, but not on the same tree.3 Fish- Go to the boat dock and walk/swim around in the water. You should seefish swimming around, just walk through them and you should collect them.1 Bottle of Drinking Water (But, not ocean water!)- Go to the waterfall by theSecret Place and just go under the waterfall to collect it. You're done! Lastchance to save for a little bit. Last chance to get some XP from Tidus andeveryone. Once you're done, head back and talk to Kairi. If your do the questwithout asking for her help, you get another Hi-Potion.CUTSCENECUTSCENEWhen you get back to the main island, you find Riku and Kairi's boats alreadylanded on the island, and your old friends--Shadows. Your wooden sword doesnothing right now, just run to the little island where you fought Riku. (If youdid.) If you want to, you can save.CUTSCENENow, that you have the Keyblade, you can destroy the Shadows. I recommend beingat least level 5 before you face the boss, although I usually train up to level6 or 7. It'll also help alot when you get to Traverse Town if you're level 7.After the cutscene with Riku, go to the Secret Place.CUTSCENECUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: DarksideHP: 300 HPEXP GAINED: 60 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.He looks big, but, he isn't even close to being strong. Darkside has 4 movesnow, and he does each in turn. First, he kneels, drawing dark power to hisheartshape on his stomach and then shooting out homing lasers. When he doesthis, go behind him and hide between his legs, the lasers can't hit you then.Second, he clenches dark power in his right first and then punches the ground,spawning 4 Shadows. Watch out for the punch though, it takes out 1/5 of yourlife bar. His third is striking with his left hand straight into the groundcausing a mini-earthquake that will slightly damage you no matter where youare, but, if you jump,you can evade the hit. His final move is when he pullshis arm out of the ground. He pulls an energy orb with his arm. He raises theorb above his head and it starts raining small energy orbs and they hurt alittle. To finish him off strike at his hands or at his head when he kneels andyou'll put him out fast. If you get low on health, use your potions or justwait for him to spawn Shadows, kill them and then collect the green healthorbs.CUTSCENE3.3 TRAVERSE TOWN Part 1My Level: 7After waking up, you find Pluto staring right into your face. Welcome toTraverse Town, boys and girls, get ready for a ride. Head out of the alleywayand head into the Accessory Shop. Be ready to see a familar face. It's Cid fromFF7! Talk to him and then save. There is an treasure chest on a shelf. Jumponto the counter then onto the shelf and get the Mythril Shard. Head back outto the streets and go around back from the shop you were just in. Go throughthe big doors and go to the 2nd District.CUTSCENETime to fight again, but this time it's just Shadows again, but now they dropmunnie, along with health orbs. Destroy them and then head back to theAccessory Shop. But wait! The 1st District is overrun by Shadows! Finish themquickly. You shouldn't have the slightest problem with Shadows by now. Now, gointo the shop and save, then leave. Get ready to meet an old friend.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: Leon (Squall)HP: 120 HPEXP GAINED: 30 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.First of all, Leon is extremely agile, and it doesn't matter if you win or losethis fight, either way, the story continues. But, if you win, you get some XPwhich you need desperately this early in the game. (Well, it's considered alotthis early in the game.) Leon likes to shoot fireballs and then come in andstrike at you. But, the gunblade attacks are slow, so you can avoid themeasily. If you jump at him, chances are he'll jump back to evade and then swipeat you. A good idea here: get outta that small area you start in and head outinto the open, you have more room to move and dodge this way. He is mostvunerable right after he shoots fireballs or right before he shoots fireballs.When he is charging the fireball, swing just as soon as the fire is launched.This will stun him. Run over and hit him till he revives. Right after he'sswung do a 3 hit combo, and then run away. Repeat as much as it takes.CUTSCENECUTSCENEAfter the cutscene, walk over to the table and open the chest. Then, save. Talkto both Yuffie and Leon and get ready for some more action.CUTSCENEYou now have a second enemy Heartless, the Soldier. They take twice as manyhits than the Shadows do before they are destroyed. For a little XP, go the wayLeon didn't go, defeat the Heartless, and then go the way Leon went. If youjump up to the balcony that is reachable and then head over to the otherbalcony, you can get a potion. Head around the other corner of the hotel, pastthe double doors you're supposed to go through to pick up another potion, thenhead through the double doors. You should yourself at a fountain, if not, youwent through the wrong door. Defeat all the Heartless and then take the firstalleyway on the right from the fountain. Once in the alley, turn the nextcorner and keep fighting and then go through the door straight ahead that leadsto the 3rd District. Head to the stairs to your right.CUTSCENEDonald and Goofy are in your party now and with them, this fight is over prettyfast, but now, you've angered someone and you have to deal with...CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: Guard ArmorHP: 700 HPEXP GAINED: UnknownITEMS DROPPED/WON: Brave Warrior, 100 munny, Elixir, Magic Spell Fire, AbilityDodge Roll.Just strike at all the body parts, starting with the arms and then legs. Afteryou deal a certain amount of damage, the body breaks up and the pieces doindividual attacks, but they reform after awhile. When you destroy a part,health orbs appear, but if you need health, you should have a potion or twoequipped in your item menu. Don't bother healing Donald or Goofy, they takecare of themselves pretty good, and they even heal you if you really need it. Agood strategy is just focus on one body part at a time.CUTSCENENow, time to do a little more business in Traverse Town. headback to the 3rdDistrict and unlock the door that leads to the 1st District. Then, head downthe alley directly behind you from the door and you'll end up at a door with aflame on it. Use your new fire magic to unlock it. Head through the door andthen time your jumps just right so you can leap from floating rock to floatingrock. Then, go around the left side of the house to enter it.CUTSCENENow, you meet the house's resident: Merlin. After he returns his house tonormal, save and then use the save point to go to your Gummi-Ship. You now havea little Gummi-Ship tutorial to go through. After that head to Wonderland. (Theupper path.)3.4 WONDERLANDMy Level: 9CUTSCENEAfter you disembark, you find yourself floating down a shaft. After you andDonald have a graceful landing, and Goofy falls on his face, you regain controlof Sora. (I've always wanted to say this...!) Follow the White Rabbit. Gothrough the door at the end of the hallway.CUTSCENECUTSCENEGo up and talk to the doorknob. Yes, you heard me, talk to the doorknob!CUTSCENEAfter the talk, go over to the bed and push it, then, go over to the table anddrink the drink to shrink. As soon as you're shrunk, jump onto the floor, butwatch out! Heartless appear! A new enemy: Red Nocturne. Don't use fire magic onthem because they'll just absorb the magic and turn it into health forthemselves.NOTE: I will no longer be telling the whereabouts of items in chests, there arefar too many and some are too difficult to explain where they are hidden. But,once you see the chests for yourself you can find the way to them yourselves.After the Heartless are destroyed, go through the doorway you opened when youpushed the bed.CUTSCENEAfter the cutscene, the Queen of Hearts tells you to find evidence of Alice'sinnocence. All you have to do is find up to 4 pieces of evidence. Anothersearch and find quest, fun. Here's where the evidence is located. Becarefulthough, Heartless are swarming the area! Before you can start finding theevidence, you must first go through the doorway to the left of the throne.There is also a save point to the left of the entrance of the Queen's Castle.Footprints: Once you enter Lotus Forest, go forward and take a right into thefirst thicket of bushes, you should see a Blue Trinity Mark and to the rightand in front of it you should see a box containing this evidence.Antenna: From the entrance to Lotus Forest, go start through the trees ahead.You should see 3 tall mushrooms, jump onto the lower one, and then to the oneon the right. Jump up to the next platform and there is another box withevidence.Stench: From the small mushroom in the last location, jump left instead ofright from the small mushroom. Jump to the leaf platform and you should seeanother leaf across a gap. It may not look like it, but you can make this jump,so just jump across, if you don't make it, just keep trying and you will. Tryto get a running headstart and then jump right at the edge of the gap. Jump upto the treetop that has the red jellybean thing on it and then jump down to theleaf platform in front of the jellybean. Follow the curve of the leaves to theleft and up to the doorway and go through. You should find yourself in theBizarre Room again, but you'll be falling from the ceiling and will land on thestove, right next to the evidence box.Claw Marks: From the entrance to Lotus Forest, you should see a Yellow Floweron the left. Give the Flower a potion through the command menu. It will makeyou big again. Go over to the big tree and target it. Hit it once. Then, goover to the big tree stump by the entrance. Then, target the jellybean thing.Turns out, it was just a fruit. PICK the fruit then EAT it. Now, from the smallmushroom in the last location, jump left instead of right from the smallmushroom. Jump to the leaf platform and you should see another leaf across agap. It may not look like it, but you can make this jump, so just jump across,if you don't make it, just keep trying and you will. Try to get a runningheadstart and then jump right at the edge of the gap. Jump up to the treetopthat has the red jellybean thing on it and then jump down to the leaf platformin front of the jellybean. Follow the curve of the leaves to the right and gothrough the doorway. You should land on a water faucet. Look in the directionGoofy is looking. See the box? Aw...but it looks so far away! Just jump andhope you make it, if you don't keep trying. Again, a running start helps. Afteryou collect all 4 evidence pieces, the Cheshire Cat appears again and teachesyou Blizzard magic.Now you can save Alice, head back to the Queen's Castle and save. Then approachthe Queen's guards by her podium and give them the evidence. What!? The Queenis just a little off, don'tcha think? Oh well, if you want to keep your head,choose one. I don't think it matters which one you choose, as far as I know,this guessing game is rigged in your favor. After you choose the box, it showsthat the Heartless tried to steal the Queen's heart, but she still doesn'tbelieve you.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: The Queen of Hearts and the Army of CardsHP: Varies.EXP GAINED: 100 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.First off, don't attack the cards, Donald and Goofy seem to have apreoccupation with taking them out. Attack the Queen first to knock her out,then head for the tower. There are 3 cranks and this is what you have to attackto win the boss fight. An easy way to take care of the cranks is to just havefull magic and use all of it against the cranks, if you run out and still needto destroy cranks, when a crank is destroyed, it releases MP bubbles or you canattack the cards. Every now and then the Queen will revive, go over and knockher down again, then go back to attacking the Tower and cranks. After it'sdemolished, a cutscene starts.You have to find Alice and the kidnappers! Save really quick and then head backinto Lotus Forest.CUTSCENEGet ready for a new enemy: Large Body. This guy is only vunerable from behind,so dodge around him and make your attack. When he glows and slaps his stomach,run away and let Donald and Goofy take this blow. After that's done with, headstraight through the forest, following the path and then go through the doorwayat the end. You'll end up in the Tea Party Garden. (Sit down in all the chairsfor some neat items. But, if you sit in the wrong chair, Heartless appear. Toget the table back, exit the room and reenter.) Go through the door on theleft. What you have to do now is turn on the two lights. Just defeat theHeartless as they appear and then jump up to the lights and TOUCH them. Now, goback the way you came and go to the right-side-up Bizarre Room. Make sure yousave on the way through the Queen's Castle, because you have anotherBOSS FIGHT: Trick MasterHP: 600 HPEXP GAINED: 150 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: Ifrit's Horn, Navi-Gummi Piece.He looks tricky, but he isn't. Still, I recommend being at least level 10before youre face him. If you need to level up, just go back to Lotus Forest.To finish Trick Master off, just keep using fire magic and when that runs out,jump up and attack him. Eventually, he'll start to droop, making it easierbecause you don't have to jump to attack him anymore. But, after awhile, he'llstand again. After a certain amount of damage, he'll walk around the room, ifyou have to, jump on top of the table and then leap at him. But, if you staycamped out on the table, he'll bat the table down into the ground, taking youradvantage away, it will return to normal after a few seconds though. When hestarts his pins on fire, cast Blizzard on them, that way you won't take anyextra damage. Keep this pattern up and he'll fold in no time. Now, you'll sealyour first \"Keyhole.\"CUTSCENEOnce you return to your Gummi-Ship, fly counter-clockwise around the ring. (Youhave to make a pit-stop at Traverse Town, but you don't have to disembark. But,this is a good chance to gain and level or two before you continue on toOlympus Coliseum.3.5 OLYPMUS COLISEUM PART 1My Level: 14All Olympus consists of is just this one Coliseum. Head straight through thebig doors in front of you. Once inside go up and talk to Phil.CUTSCENETry to move the pedistal. When you say \"It weighs a ton!\" Go back and talk toPhil again.CUTSCENESave, then talk to Phil again. You now have to go through 2 trials.TRIAL 1Barrels: 20Time Limit: 30 SecondsRun foward, hit the three barrels till they break. Run to the next group, ifthere are any left. if not, jump up to the next group and strike them. Finishoff any remaining barrels with Fire, Blizzard, or normal strikes.TRIAL 2Barrels: 25Time Limit: 1 MinuteFirst off, run around to the left, strike the barrels, turn around the corner,LIFT the single barrel, target the barrel along this straight part, THROW it atthe single barrel, run around the next corner and you're almost at where youstarted. There is 2 barrels stacked on top of each other and a single barrel.Target the single and rotate the camera around so the you and the single barrelface the stacked barrels. Strike until the barrel flys at the stacked ones.Jump up to the next set, break them with Keyblade hits. Jump up to the nextlayer and there is a single barrel and 2 stacks of 2. Same plan as before.Finish the remaining barrels with hits. Jump up, another single and 3 stacks of2. Same plan as the last 2 sets. Finish the next barrel with your Keyblade andthen there is one left. It is on a platform in the air that you can't jump to,use fire magic.CUTSCENEREWARD: Magic Spell ThunderBut, Phil still won't let you in the games! Alright, forget him, leave thecoliseum.CUTSCENEOoh, what's this!? An Entry Pass! Go back and show Phil who's who! Be sure tosave your game when you reenter the coliseum. Now, it's time for thepreliminaries! Even though it's against my policy this early in the game, giveDonald and Goofy potions. (Have you customized their preferences yet? Set theirHP and MP items usage to \"Only in Emergancies\"!)PRELIMINARIES--7 SeedsMatch 1: Shadow Scout4x Soldiers3x Blue RhapsodiesUse fire against the Blue ones. This is simple stuff right here.CUTSCENE (Yeah, that's right, that's Cloud from FF7!)Match 2: Sinisters3x Blue Rhapsodies10x ShadowsFire against the Blue things, you should know how to handle Shadows by now!Match 3: Heat & Freeze5x Red Nocturne5x Blue RhapsodiesFire against the blue things, ice against the red. Make sure you know whichtype you're locked onto! If you've run out of magic, use normal hits.CUTSCENEMatch 4: Shadow Platoon3x Red Nocturne3x Blue Rhapsodies2x Shadows2x SoldiersTake care of the magic spitters first, then the Soldiers. Finish off theShadows last.Match 5: Blue Revenge10x Blue RhapsodiesNormal hits or fire magic.CUTSCENEMatch 6: Big One1x Large Body4x Red Nocturne4x Blue RhapsodiesGo after the Large Body first, and then finish the magic spitters off. DodgeRoll (You have it equipped, right?) around to avoid the Tummy Slap of Deaththing.Match 7: Final MatchBOSS FIGHT: CloudHP: 300 HPEXP GAINED: 80 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.First of all, you don't HAVE to win this fight. This is the same as the fightwith Leon, you can lose and still progress. But, for those of you who want tobeat Cloud down, here's what to do. Use normal attacks, he seems to be fireproof. Or you can use Blizzard and Thunder, but your MPs won't last long. Saveyour potions for you. Donald and Goofy (depending on how good you did) shouldstill have some left for themselves and you. You should still have all 3 ofyours. When he leaps up and then impales the ground, be sure to Dodge Roll outof the way. Cloud also likes to stab forwards while sliding, and then doing a 3hit combo. Just Dodge Roll out of the way. If you jump at Cloud to hit him fromthe air, he'll most likely jump back to avoid and possibly counterattack withthat slide/stab thing. If you can, strike at the same time as Cloud so youdeflect his attack. This causes him to stop and you can get a good combo in onhim. (Combo Plus, you have it equipped, right?) After you do alot of damage tohim. He changes his lunge attack. Instead of doing a 3 hit combo after thelunge, he does a 180 turn and then lunges again,180 turn and lunges again. Hedoes the lunge/180 thing 5 times. Just jump over his attacks the first 4 times.The 5th time, however. he slide/lunges and then 180's and jump/stabs theground. Dodge Roll this one. After you do enough damage, he does the jump/stabground thing repeatedly. Just keep Dodge Rolling and striking him when he pullshis sword out of the ground and he should be finished quickly.CUTSCENESave first, now you have a choice. A. Save Hercules or B. Run away and levelup. If you are level 15 or higher, you should be safe, if not, choose B. Eitherway, make sure you saved, make sure you reequip the 3 of you with HP and MPhealing items, and then do what you chose.If you choose to \"Go from Zero to HERO!\" you get aCUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: CerberusHP: 600HPEXP GAINED: 200 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: Inferno Band, Hero License, Ability Sonic Blade.Let Donald and Goofy do most of the damage until they get K.O.'d. Watch out forCerberus's bites, they do alot of damage. Dodge Roll around and jump at theheads. Use Thunder magic to cause a lot of damage. Cerberus shoots meteors outof it's mouths, so be sure to Dodge Roll or jump over them. A good tactic is toget behind Cerberus and then try to jump onto it's right heal and then ontoit's back. Run up it's back and then Lock-On and strike the heads. WhenCerberus rears up and slams it's paws on the ground be sure to jump the secondbefore the paws hit. When Cerberus shoots dark energy into the ground, DodgeRoll around to avoid the energy pillars that crash out of the ground or jumponto it's back.CUTSCENEOnce that's over, go back inside, save and then leave. Wait, is that... Cloudon the steps there by the exit...?CUTSCENENow, leave for real this time.CUTSCENEIf you want, head back to Traverse Town. Personally, I always take a trip backto Traverse Town and make one run through the 2nd District, Hotel, Gizmo Shop,and 3rd District for some XP. If you go to the Item Shop, you can buy some newweapons for Donald and Goofy. This is also a good chance to level up. Whateveryou do, the next level is...3.6 DEEP JUNGLEMy Level: 17NOTE: DURING THIS LEVEL, SABOR, THE LEOPARD, WILL RANDOMLY APPEAR AT TIMES. ASFAR AS I KNOW, THERE IS NO SET PATERN FOR HIS APPEARENCES OTHER THAN THEY TENDTO HAPPEN AFTER A CUTSCENE. I AM PUTTING IN WHERE I HAVE SEEN HIM APPEAR. YOUMIGHT NOT NECESSARILY SEE HIM AT THE SAME SPOT THAT I DO.What's this!? You and Donald fight over the controls for the Gummi-Ship, youwant to check out the jungle for Riku and Kairi, but he doesn't think that theKing is there. The Gummi-Ship crash lands on Deep Jungle.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: SaborHP: 90 HPEXP GAINED: 15 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Again, Fire magic is your best friend. Lock on and shoot the fire till your MPsrun out, then switch to sword hits. When you build your MP back up, use Fireagain. Sabor likes to jump around and then follow up with a claw swipe or two.So, just stay on the ground during the jump and then Dodge Roll away.CUTSCENEFirst thing you want to do is change Tarzan's preferences to what I recommendedearlier. (HP and MP items used only in an emergancy.) Then, if you want to,(This is what I usually do.) steal all of Tarzan's items and accessories. but,you don't have to, it's just fun and gets you some neat stuff sometimes. Now,just jump off the same way Tarzan did. Now, you have a chance to save the game,either jump down the tree trunk and \"surf\" down the tree branches like from themovie or, jump up the two platforms. If you choose the tree trunk, you'll endup at the camp site right away, then just head into the tent. If you choose togo through the doorway by the platforms, go through the door, through the nextdoor, now from the platform you're on, jump down to the next level and falldown the hole to your right. Then, just jump off that tree top and you'll landin some water. Swim to the ramp and go on that platform and head in thedirection you were facing when you appeared in this room. Now, take the door onthe left and you'll end up at the camp site. Enter the tent.CUTSCENESave your game and talk to Jane. Oops! She lost the slides, guess you have tosearch and find them! Here's the locations.Slide 1: On top of the tent with Jane in it. Beside it is a globe and someboxes. Jump onto the boxes and then onto the tent. It's laying right in thecenter of the tent and you can't miss it.Slide 2: From the top of the tent, jump off into the little clearing surroundedby tents, on a green dresser there is a slide.Slide 3: This one is by the art easel, which is to the right of the boxes youused to jump up onto the tent.Slide 4: On top of the huge stack of boxes in the middle of the area. (If youcan somehow miss this pile, it is directly in front of the tent.)Slide 5: Go back to where you found slide 1, jump onto the long stretch oftents, it is in the middle of the very last tent.Slide 6: Behind the globe on the boxes you used to jump up to slide 1.Once you have collected them all. head back into the tent and save. Then,EXAMINE the projector.CUTSCENEGet the feeling Mr. Clayton is up to something? Me too... Oh well, make sureyou have Goofy and Tarzan in your party. Donald is usless right none basicallybecause he has such weak HP. After this is set up, save again if you want andthen leave the tent. But, as soon as you get outside...BOSS FIGHT: SaborHP: 90 HPEXP GAINED: 15 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Again, Fire magic is your best friend. Lock on and shoot the fire till your MPsrun out, then switch to sword hits. When you build your MP back up, use Fireagain. Sabor likes to jump around and then follow up with a claw swipe or two.So, just stay on the ground during the jump and then Dodge Roll away. Betweenthe three of you, Sabor shouldn't last more than 30 seconds.After Sabor runs away again, tail between legs, go around the lab table and outthat doorway. Now there are two ways you can go again. The easiest is thesecond, because the vine rope jumping is a huge pain, so I won't even botherexplaining that part and I'll just go with the easy path. From where you enterthe Hippo's Lagoon area, turn right and jump onto the first hippo, then over tothe grass. Go to the right of that platform and jump across onto the nextplatform. Turn left a little and you should see another platform, jump to itthen turn left again, you should se a small tree, jump on top of it, then upanother tree top, and then finally a third. Jump down onto the platform (ordirectly to the hippos back) and then jump onto the little island with atreasure chest on it. Climb up this vine.CUTSCENENow, head back to the tree house. A quick way back to the tree house is this:once the cinema ends, turn to the left and you should see a vine, climb it andyou should be in a room called Climbing Trees. Follow the path around and jumpto the platform across from you. If you are on the right platform, you shouldsee a blueTrinity mark on it. Go through the door behind the Trinity mark.CUTSCENENow, head back to the campsite, using the same path you did the first time.But, when you get back to the campsite...BOSS FIGHT: SaborHP: 90 HPEXP GAINED: 15 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Again, Fire magic is your best friend. Lock on and shoot the fire till your MPsrun out, then switch to sword hits. When you build your MP back up, use Fireagain. Sabor likes to jump around and then follow up with a claw swipe or two.So, just stay on the ground during the jump and then Dodge Roll away. Betweenthe three of you, Sabor shouldn't last more than 30 seconds.After the fight with Sabor, head into the tent again.CUTSCENESave the game and go see what Clayton fired at!CUTSCENE (But a very short one!)Quick defeat those new monkey Heartless to save the gorilla! Now it's time togo to an area that you haven't been to yet. The Bamboo Thicket. Leaving thetent, take a right and head into the Bamboo. Another group of Heartless! Goodjob, you saved another gorilla, head through to the next room. More Heartless,finish them to save another gorilla. Now, head back to camp. Finish off anyHeartless you encounter along the way. You probably will have another encounterin the Bamboo Thicket and after you destroy the first wave of Heartless, you'llface a second wave with another new enemy: Power Wild. (The other monkey thingis a Bouncy Wild.) Be sure to save when you get back to camp. When you exit thetent, you might encounter a mushroom thing that is white with a red hat. DO NOTATTACK THEM. Pay attention to what they do. If you play their little game ofcharades 3 times, you'll get some cool items. Right now though, you can only do3 magic spells so cast a certain magic on them after they do a certain thing.Thunder: A light above it's head.Blizzard: On their knees begging.Fire: Shivering.And for later on...Cure: Laying down on the ground.Aero: Spinning in circles.Stop: They don't move.Gravity: Floating in the air.Now, after the mushrooms, head to the Treetop room again. (The room you wentthrough to get to the tree house.) When you get to the tree top room, you haveto fight more Heartless. Another gorilla saved. Head to the tree house. Onceinside the tree house, another fight commences and another gorilla is saved.Head back to camp, head into the tent, save, and then leave.CUTSCENEHead off into the thicket again. (The direction of the gunshot.)CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: SaborHP: 180 HPEXP GAINED: 150 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: White Fang.Ooh, Sabor's back and he has some more HP now...oh well, use fire again tostart off. Once it runs out, go in close and attck relentlessly. Sabor likes tojump around and then follow up with a claw swipe or two. So, just stay on theground during the jump and then Dodge Roll away. After you hit him enough,he'll jump into the trees and you'll lose your lock on. Just wait for him toreappear, which is usually on the otherside of the thicket. He also has a newattack. He headbutt lunges at you. Just jump when you see him lower his head.CUTSCENEThat is the last time you have to worry about Sabor. But, hurry! Get back tocamp and check on Jane! Take care of any Heartless in the area and then headinside the tent.CUTSCENESave quickly and run back to the treetop area where you can get to the treehouse. But, when you get to the tree top area, you find Jane and the gorillacaptive! Just destroy the big black fruit because the Heartless just keeprespawning if you don't. Head back to the campsite again once you're done.Destroy any Heartless and then head inside the tent. Save your game and thenhead to the thicket. Once there, head into the area after it. (The Cliff area.)NOTE: You may encounter Heartless in the thicket, if you do, use a Tent,Cottage or Camping Set to heal yourself.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: ClaytonHP: 250 HPEXP GAINED: None.ITEMS DROPPED/WON: None.Clayton has a group of Heartless that you'll wanna take care of first. Claytonjust LOVES to heal himself after you do any damage to him, so you'll have to bequick. Also, his shotgun does alot of damage, depending on how close you are tohim. But, he stops after every 3 shots to reload or use a potion. He will alsoswing his gun around and strike you with it. Do not use any magic on him yet,you'll need it later.CUTSCENEBOSS FIGHT: Stealth Sneak and ClaytonHP: Stealth Sneak: 750 HP Clayton: 250 HPEXP GAINED: Stealth Sneak: 30 XP if first defeated, 240 XP if second defeated.Clayton: 30 XP if first defeated, 240 XP if second defeated.ITEMS DROPPED/WON: Magic Spell Cure, Navi-G Piece, Jungle King, Red Trinity.To get to Clayton, you must first knock him off his mount. Target the StealthSneak and use fire magic on him. (You listened to me when I told you to saveit, right?) Now, Clayton shoots from his mount (till he falls) and then, theStealth Sneak also shoots twin lasers out of it's hands and twing homing lasersout of it's eyes. When the two seperate, go for the Stealth Sneak first, thenfinish Clayton off. Stealth Sneak will also headbutt you, this is a pain whentrying to heal and you get interuppted.CUTSCENEHead up into the cave and make your way upwards by jumping from platform toplatform. Once you reach the top, go through the top cave entrance. Now, you'llseal your second \"Keyhole\".CUTSCENECUTSCENECUTSCENE(Yeah, that's alot of cutscenes.)You heard Donald and Goofy! Head back to Traverse Town and talk to Leon!3.7 Traverse Town Part 2My Level: 20Once you're back in Traverse Town, head to the 2nd District's Hotel. Go intothe Green Room and exit through the back door. If you want, before you gothrough into the Hotel, spend some time and level up in the 2nd District andthe Gizmo Shop. Also, if you've collected any of the 101 Dalmations, you shouldcheck out Pongo and Perdita's house in the back alley of the 2nd District. Ifyou decide to level up a little, becareful, there are alot of Large Bodies inTraverse Town now. There are also 3 new enemies. Yellow Opera, Green Requiemand Air Soldier. They are fairly strong, especially the Green Requiem. Whilethey never attack, they do use CURE and when they use Cure on a Large Body, itcan do a whole lot of damage. When you're ready, head to the right when you getout in the alley behind the hotel and go to the barred doorway. There is a RedTrinity right by it, use it and then go into the door. Swim through the channeland talk to Leon. After he tells you about sealing the Keyholes, talk to himagain. Ooh, you got a pretty little gem...better head up those stairs behindyou so you can find Cid. When you get to the top of the stairs, you'll see aplatform, jump onto it and you'll appear in the Merlin's House. Head out ofMerlin's house and go to the 3rd District. Take care of any Heartless here andthen go through the doors leading to the 1st District. Go into the AccessoryShop and talk to Cid about the Gummi Block. Save the game while you're heretoo.CUTSCENEHmm...something's going on at the Gizmo Shop, eh? Well...deliver the book toMerlin first, then we'll go exploring! Oh! How about that? Done and done. Youmade the delivery and even got a summon spell out of it! What luck! Head backto the 3rd District now, you know that small abandoned house? Well, Cid, Leon,Yuffie, and Aerith have all taken residence up in there. Drop in and say hi.But, you're interupted before you can get to the house.CUTSCENENow, that's odd...Riku disappeared on ya...oh well, it had to have beenimportant. Now, head to house you were going to before. Go over and talk toCid.CUTSCENENow, leave that cozy lil house and head to the 1st District and save your game,now head to the 2nd District's Gizmo Shop. Fight through all the Heartless(There's around 5 waves of Heartless) and then exit the Gizmo shop through thedoor on the other side of the room. Climb the ladder to the left and you're onthe roof. Use Red Trinity on the boards and PULL on the bell 3 times. What'sthis!? A keyhole, right here in Traverse Town! Just like Leon said!CUTSCENEMaybe you should try to seal it...might want to head back to the 1st Districtand save though...(Make sure you go through the 3rd District or stay on theupper walkway if you do though because...)BOSS FIGHT: Opposite ArmorHP: 1200 HPEXP GAINED: 390 XPITEMS DROPPED/WON: Magic Spell Aero, Navi-G Piece.For the first few strikes, it attacks you as Guard Armor, so use the sametactics as last time, but, after a you do a certain amount of damage, it turnsinto Opposite Armor. Just Dodge Roll when it tries to use it's Stomach lasercannon. When the pieces fall apart, go after the legs first, then the arms.When I say legs, I mean the things that he walks on now, not the actual legs.Same thing for the arms. Try to stay underneath the Armor to avoid most of thedamage. When the parts break, they drop a lot of health orbs, run and pick themup as fast as you can. Hopefully, you have Cure in your shortcut menu, cause ifnot, you're gonna die trying to heal yourself the long way. Use Thunder alot,but always make sure you have 1 MP left so you can heal yourself. Or you canuse potions, but I don't know if you guys have them equipped.After you beat him, you seal the Keyhole. Head back to the Accessory Shop andsave. But, when you get to the shop, the clerk is missing and someone issleeping on the floor!CUTSCENENow, you can save. Then, go to your new and improved Gummi-Ship. Ooh, but wait!There's a tournament being held at the Coliseum...and a great reward is beingoffered to the winner. Maybe you should go and level up there a little, eh? Forhelp beating the Phil Cup, check out the Side-Quests section of theFAQ/Walkthrough. So, if you want to compete now, scroll down, which I suggestyou do. After that, head to the WARP HOLE that is located after the Coliseum.Enter the hole (you'll have to use your warp drive to get to Olympus and thenselect the warp hole) and you're on your way to Agrabah.3.8 AGRABAHMy level: 24CUTSCENEAs soon as it ends, a new kind of Heartless attack. Just use normal attacks,and then head through the little wooden door to the left. Smash the barrels forsome munnies and then save. Head back to the Plaza and then go through the hugeopen doorway. One thing, the Shadows are tougher now. They cause more damage,and can take more. But, you also get more XP for defeating them. Another fightcommences, dispatch the Heartless. From the door way you entered from, take theright path, and then to the end of that path. To the right there is a pole,climb it. MOVE the dresser off of the carpet. Some treasue chests and a savepoint. If you should exit this room and return, there will be a manselling/buying items. Against the wall to the far right of the save point thereis another dresser, MOVE it and RELEASE the lock. Head out of the room usingthe open door. Ah! You're back in the Plaza, but on a higher level. Turn to theright from where you start and you should see some open windows with a woodenawning thing sticking out. Jump to the first one, then to the second, then ontothe solid ground quickly. Why? Because if you stay of those wooden awnings formore than 1 second, they fall off and you'll have to do it all over again.Remember that lock you released? It opened this gate here, go through it.Onceyou're back on Main Street, take the left path (the one you didn't take before)and go through that doorway.CUTSCENEUh-oh...before you can find Aladdin, you have to beat these Heartless, onceyou're done with that, jump onto the boxes in the left corner and up to thatplatform. RELEASE the lock and then turn to the right from the lock and youshould see some more open windows with awnings sticking out. Jump to the firstone, then to the second, then onto the solid ground quickly. Wy? q"
