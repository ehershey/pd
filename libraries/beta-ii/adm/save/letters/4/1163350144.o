__Letter "I was looking at the MP-costs on the spells.It seems that they ALL are based on how much damage you inflict.This is why the MP is getting drained so fast where it wasn'tbefore. As a mage's power levels increase, the MP costs will aswell. Doesn't seem fair to the mage this way :(Might wanna base the spell costs against their wisdom or intelnot the damage they're inflicting on their victim. Way they arewired right now a mage would be drained in no time... Which iswhat happens with Ironman. It's just now I understand WHY it washappening from reading the file so i can give you a more accuratefeedback on it...Don't worry tho. This discussion stays between you, stormy and meNot going to give out info about how the skills function to non-staffironman"
