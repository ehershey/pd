__Letter "Hey Stormy, I would like to tell you about a situation. Well, yesterday Arma pk'd me on my alt Hextor in a lawful area. Then, today he pk'd me on this char as his alt Ximer. It is impossible for me to get anywhere with him around. I know him irl, we hate each other and he's given me a hard time ever since ive started playing. For reference you can check the death records of Joker, Hextor, Tsfaru, Mantice, and Agrus. Im not usually one for complaining, but dang I can even get to level 35 to start stating.....Plz help me.-/TsfarU\\-"
