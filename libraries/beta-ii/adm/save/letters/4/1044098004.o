__Letter "Heya,I'm not sure if you'd even consider it. But I'm interested in an Immortal Position. The reasons being. I've reached a stage where I feel no need or point in exping, Prator and the others are on like 1mil a minute at the moment and I can't compare to that... well ever. Not as I am. However I love this game, and I know I'll stay on anyway. So I figure I might as well help out and do something. I have limited coding experience and such, but I intend to make a few different areas very soon (well start on them anyway) that I have my heart set on. As for the rest well I learn quickly and would pretty much do whatever you told me too. Plus I'm on often when there are no other imms or Admins on, so I could keep my eye on the bug abusing buggers :P.Anyway enough said I'll leave you with that. Oh and I hear imms are allowed characters as long as no-one knows who they are? I was thinking maybe keeping Halo and having a new charater that no-one knows at all as my imm. But if I were to be an imm I'd prefer to still be halo then to just lose him all together. Well so much for leaving it at that :PLatersHalo :)"
