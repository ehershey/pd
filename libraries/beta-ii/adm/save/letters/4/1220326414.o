__Letter "has there ever been a discussion on if they would put a lvl cap on how much you can up each stat in a lvl. i think if they did that it would make people want to lvl more because most will stay at one lvl forever and just buff up. i was just thinking about that today and it doesn't make sence to me but if you like the idea maybe you could run it by another imm or admin word it better i'm never good at wording things right when i'm trying to explain my ideasand you know how much they love to throw up my ideas lolout not upwell talk to you later hon"
