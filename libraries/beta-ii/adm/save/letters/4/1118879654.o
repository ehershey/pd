__Letter "I was wondering the mobs in purg load some cool armor, but for some reason they never drop the boots or leggings, but they drop the swords, armor and gauntlets.. any chance you guys would consider letting them drop the leggings and boot and make them like lvl 65 + or somethin?would be nice to actually have a set of matching armor, kinda like the crystal set except not so difficult"
