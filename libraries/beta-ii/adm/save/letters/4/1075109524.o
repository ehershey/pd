__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Aziraphale to Whit Fri Dec 19 18:54:41 2003:-----Did you need to know where to find them? I got Amarael to make it all while builders was down.You can find it all in /wizards/amarael/illuminati/ here on game port.The weapons are all done exactly to Stormy's balance, but the badge: \"ilcrest\" I think it is called, might not be. Please don't make it too bad, it's like something another guild has already.I believe also there is a 'notes' file in the base illuminati directory there, that has details of the stuff taht has been added and removed etc."
