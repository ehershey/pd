__Letter "Sorry about the late reply, been busy and idle the last few days. One of the rules when with Forsaken is that you cant have any alts in any other guilds, if you play them or if you dont. We believe that you have a alt in another guild, so sorry, you wont be able to join. Once again sorry for the late reply. :/"
