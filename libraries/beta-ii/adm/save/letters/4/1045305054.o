__Letter "I wouldn't be a maverick doing what I pleased, I would be directly under your leadership, as well as any of the other Admins or Immortals here.If I'm not performing to you satisfaction, then just smack my butt back to player and tell me that I'm dumber then a retarded monkey.I'll be on later tomorrow if you wish to discuss this further.  I honostly think that I could help the game out this way... And I'd still be doing the newspaper, of course (Another good idea of mine)I talked to Daos and Wraith about this and I'm pasting their conversation now.  It's verbatem, some of the stuff that didn't releate to the topic at hand was taken out but other then that...Daos says: Stormbringer may want to balance it out more.Daos says: Hell, that's up to him.You nod solemnly.You say: I respect Stormy, I really do.You say: But some of his balance decisions don't really jive with me.You shrug helplessly.You say: I think I'd make a great balancer, I mean it was my idea about the entire AC adjustment thing.You say: And if I was an immortal I would most likely go around playing a class with average skills/stats and see what needed adjusting.You say: For instance, I played a pyromancer up to level 20.  Most of his spells are horrid.You say: He needs a bad adjustmentDaos nods solemnly.You say: And for DruidsDaos says: Wanderers are also pretty fucked.You say: Sandcone is a worthless spell for usYou say: By the time I get it, my bolt does more damageDaos says: Gypsys are fine, the rest need balancing.You say: And by the time that sandcone surpasses bolt in damage, I have thornwrack.You say: I know Druids are supposed to be good early on then peeter out later.  But I'm pretty much the only druid to make it to elite and I can tell you it's been a *long* climb.You say: When it takes you five castings of thornwrack to kill a 20k mob at level 49, then you spend a week getting to 50 almostDaos says: Hermes, if you were to make Immortal you would still be under Stormbringer's say under balance of spells/skills.You nod solemnly.You say: Of course.Daos says: We don't always agree with him, he is the final say.You say: I'm not going to go around being a Maverick and adjusting stuff without any saysoYou say: I'd gather a report, give it to him and anyone else who wants itYou say: And with his permission, make the adjustments or if he wants, let him make the adjustments.  Just so I'm doing *something* to help.You say: That would take a huge load off of him in my opinion.Daos nods solemnly.You shrug helplessly.You ask: Can you see my point?Daos nods solemnly.Daos says: Do you like what NS has done with ac?You nod solemnly.You say: I do indeed.You say: It's exactly like I had invisioned it.Daos says: That has several advantages/disadvantages per-se.Daos says: For every class.You say: Of courseYou say: But I'm not talking about making huge adjustments like NS did... I'm talking about adjusting firebomb, or liquifyYou say: AnywayYou ask: If I went to Stormy with my idea, could I say you thought it was a good idea?Daos nods solemnly.You say: I want to see what Wraith thinks. And if he likes it I'll present it to Stormy tomorrow.You tell Wraith: YoYou tell Wraith: I've been talking with DaosWraith replies: supYou tell Wraith: He thinks the idea of me being an immortal balancer is a goodone.  Lemme tell you the specifics and see what you thinkYou tell Wraith: Basically I'd be an immortal. But I'd add what Stormy ismissing, a player perspective.  I'd become a class, and with my immortalstatus I would XP and play it, making notes at what I thought neededadjusting. Then I'd give it to Stormy for the nod and then adjust itYou tell Wraith: Stormy is a great guy, don't get me wrong, but he doesn'thave the perspective that I do, as a player, from the year I've been on PD.Wraith replies: In that case, we should give balance to a more experiencedplayer, like say faust, or ashramYou reply to Wraith: Maybe... But I also have ideas that they don't.  I.E. TheAC adjustment.Wraith replies: those can be passed onYou reply to Wraith: Do you think Faust or Ashram would be as unbiased as Iam?You reply to Wraith: Do they want that sort of job?Wraith replies: 2/3 of the balance in the game since ashram left were hisformulasYou reply to Wraith: This game needs balance. Don't tell me itdoesn't. Now Stormy is excellent, hell I consider him a buddy, but he doesn't have the pespective I do and I'm willing to make an effort.Wraith replies: lol, it does, and stormie is going through everything, one byoneYou reply to Wraith: If you think Faust would be a better idea and he waswilling to do it, then I say go for itYou reply to Wraith: Like I said before, Stormy is good but he doesn't havethe perspective that players do.Wraith replies: Ok then, What would you change on things that have beenbalanced alreadyYou reply to Wraith: I don't have any ideas yet.  Like I said, what I would dois pick a class/subclass then build a character to a level of x.  I would makea report and present it to Stormy of things that I think need adjusting. Andwith his approval/changes I would make them thus allevating him of most mudanework.Wraith tells you: how about you start makin characters, testing them to lvl 60with 75 in statsreply I really need to be an immortal.  As it would take to long to make a report if I had to, say, spend time xping to raise stats to what would be an average amountYou reply to Wraith: And I really need to be an immortal.  As it would take tolong to make a report if I had to, say, spend time xping to raise stats towhat would be an average amountYou reply to Wraith: Dude, come on.  I'm trying to help the Mud and I wantyour support so Stormy might actually say yes.You reply to Wraith: You know my ideas are good.Wraith replies: im iffy on it, stormie has his own ideas on what should bebalanced and what should be changedYou reply to Wraith: But that's the thing. He'd have all say.  I'd just givehim a report and let him change it as will.  That's certainly better then himdoing all these random adjustments.  I'm not the only one to think so either.Many have observed that when a skill gets adjusted it either becomes way buffor is overnerfedYou reply to Wraith: I.E. ThornwrackYou reply to Wraith: Or SwipeYou reply to Wraith: But that's not my point.  What is my point is that asgood as Stormy is, he lacks the perception of a player and that adequates tomistakes.  Even Einstien can't make a nuke unless he has someone to field testvarious firing pins for him.Wraith replies: lmaoYou reply to Wraith: I'm just using that to illustrate my point.  Scientificprogress involves field work, and that involves mundane tasks that shouldn'tbe done by an admin.Wraith replies: present your idea to stormie, but I dun want you callin yourplayer without another imm/admin online with youYou reply to Wraith: If I was willing to accept those terms, would you bewilling to support my idea?Wraith replies: I wont hack it, if thats what yer askinAnyway Stormy, I have Daos's backup, and at least Wraith's grudging approval.  That counts for something, eh?So I'm looking forward to your responce, thinks for reading this overly long peice of crap.  I look forward to your reply.-Hermes"
