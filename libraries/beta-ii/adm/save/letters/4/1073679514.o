__Letter "No, that's just fine. I said you're irritating because I asked you how you got into the guild like 15 times and you wouldn't respond, yet you'd respond to other comments. Finally I realized that you never got into it at all, and just scry'd me. And for the last time, there IS a space between making and it, it just doesn't come out that way because of the mapping system. The way I had it on builders, it was just fine. If you can't understand that, it isn't my problem. Thanks for \"being helpful\", but I don't like it when my questions get ignored."
