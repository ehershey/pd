__Letter "I'm trying to help Daos get his last on thing going. As far as I can tell, the only way to find out when a player who is not on was last on, is to restore their file. Looking at /daemon/daemon/finger_d.c, I added a last_on variable, included dirs.h, and tried to (warning pseudocode ahead!) restore_object( DIR_USERS/<first initial>/<name> );, but it said that the read failed or something. So then I tried the same path with file_exists(), but I'm told that the file doesn't exist... Is this an issue with EUID's and access and such? Is there any way I can do this? I have a copy of my attempts so far at /wizards/nesoo/test/_laston.c (I'm sure the formatting of the output for any people who are offline is wrong, but I'm not worried about fixing that yet... that part is still Daos' original code), starting around line 100. Thanks for your help.P.S. Oh, yes, with the file_exists(), I tried both with and without a .o at the end, no cigar either way.x"
