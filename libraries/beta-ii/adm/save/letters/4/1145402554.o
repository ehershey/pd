__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Carina to Nesoo Mon Apr 17 18:45:02 2006:-----the reason i am making such a big deal out of this, is b/c this has happened many times and noone did shit about it.you all claim that you dont like rule breakers, and yall claim that you do what you can to make this a fun mud.when you allow the harassment from people to continue.  I mean vyce was PK spreeing for the greater part of 2 months before he was caught.  So what? i have to sit here and allow xerxes and his friends to harass me and cut me down every chance they get b/c you all dont feel like doing anything about it?I know you are busy, and so am I. But when i DO come onto the mud I want to play, not listen to some 10 year old ass hole talk about his fucking insecruities and how much of an ass he is, so he is going to do everything he can to make it to where i want to kill him in real life b/c he is a fuckign immature bastard that has no life and needs to get laid. It's not my fault he cant get off his mothers tit long enough to find some pussy, so he should not take it out on me, and YOU shouldnt allow it. sorry that i cussed a lot, and sorry that i am so annoyed with this that i will continue buggin you and other admins, until you do something about it.Carina"
