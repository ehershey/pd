__Letter "I read your mail, prepared answers, and here they are. They're not really edited and filtered, rather, what I thought on the spot. While this may make them far from perfect, I believe they're more accurate then if I sat down and said only what you wanted to hear. The conditions you specified at the top of your letter are fine- what I'll do is, if given the position, store Sasayaki, Ame, Youjutsu and Wunshoo away for safe keeping, but make Venenum my immortal character. Becomming a member of the immortal guild is fine with me as well.1.  Why do you want to become an imm?I want to become a guild because I feel it would allow me to have a chance at doing some of the things I've wanted to get around to for a while. Writing up new messages for spells and abilities, touching up room descriptions, etc. Not only that, I feel that being a player distracts from my coding- I'd rather spend the time I'd take getting another alt to level 37 on coding. Being an immortal would mean that I can be on players port without feeling I need to play.2.  What is it that you would like to do or what do you plan on doing?I, primarily, like to code and build. That's what I do, really, and it's what I plan to keep on doing. But there are other things I'd really like, such as touching up spell and ability messages, fixing bugs and typos, coding new areas and helping improve any aspect of the game I can.3.  How well do you think you can handle players you dont like or dont likeyou?I think I'd handle them just fine. Opinions are just that; it's impossible to please everyone, and at some point or another, someone is going to resent your position or your choices in some respect. For me, I love (preferably constructive) criticism when I've made an area- I believe the ultimate goal when coding or building is to make the mud a better place, so if people have complaints then (even if I think it's a great idea) they may have a point. As for disliking me, well again, it's impossible to be everyone's friend, so I realise that sometimes people will just not like you.4.  How would you handle said players?I believe I can deal with said players quite well. Engaging players about their grievances is always the first step, as often, they may indeed have a valid point. Nobody is perfect, and the only way we become better people and better coders is by making mistakes. While I do make mistakes, everyone does, I make a determined effort to learn from them. However, occasionally said players have an unreasonable grievance to bear, and often the best way to deal with that is to bring in someone outside to help deal with it if it's a personal issue, or if it's a coding one, take a day off and look at my code and think, well, maybe there is another way of doing things. Often there is. But at the end of the day, if all other avenues have been exhausted, there's always the ignore command. -- Sasayaki."
