__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Helena to Hepualahaole Mon Aug  9 12:13:12 2004:-----For once a tale told so bold,Of the blood red princess dressed in gold.At the full moon's rising, at the full moon's night,The fires of hell showed her true form of might.Her one true love, a man of great respect,Was torn inside for his love's regret.One night in spring, unto her did heTake her life with a knife, and then decree\"May this grove forever be full of roses scorned,\"For my heart is now broken, and my soul battle-worn.\"But for taking his life he did not know,Of the curse she carried, and thus was added to his woe,That the man became a beast, of sad reflection to his wife,Had he no longer hands, nor hair, nor a human's life.Curses the fates he did in rage,And in sadness cry out for the end.But now it is time to turn the page,And see what salvation fate did thus send.For upon this moment, did the Beast Queen seeA sore-hearted beast, and in her heart felt pity.Into a fearies' mist did the Queen lead him,So that forever may his soul rest without thought of sin.And so the King of Beasts commanded the dales,To cry dew-drop tears every misty night,In memory of the sad and unforetunate taleOf the Princess and her Knight.//like i siad, it got longer :-\\"
