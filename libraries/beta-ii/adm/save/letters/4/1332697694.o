__Letter "The bass is simply going direct into the mixer!That is simply the new Stick bass :)I did however, mix and match the strings. Pretty much phatter across the board. The equivalent of playing 13's on the guitar. 'cept I changed the 13 to a 12, as it was way too stiff for tapping.Here's my secret recipe:120 100 80 55 39 21 17 12Fodera Bass, D'Addario Guitar and one Ernie Ball #21. I think this makes for a more uniform tone than the recommended tuning. I charted all the gauges and mapped a curve"
