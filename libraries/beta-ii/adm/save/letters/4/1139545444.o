__Letter "Hey Beautiful, I miss you so much right now, I'm kinda sleepy and all I can think about is holding you in my arms and never letting you go. I want to talk to you so badly over the phone it's not funny. Your voice is so beautiful and enchanting that I could live happy just hearing it for a second. But hopefully my little \"vision\" thing comes true and we get to talk a little bit atleast tomorrow, if not then there's always next week hopefully. But I do love you with all of my heart and I can't wait to see you in person, it's going to be the greastest thing ever, I just know it. But I'm starting to ramble now it seems. *sighs* I'm sorry for all the rambling, I just miss you so much and I can't wait to talk to you, much less hold you tightly in my arms and whisper, \"I love you.\" softly into your ear. *smiles happily* I hope you have sweet dreams tonight and I hope you have a good day tomororw. To tell you the truth tomorrow should go by well for me because we have a pep rally which means all of my classes get cut shorter, INCLUDING my history class, yay! But none the less I'll go ahead and finish this up, I'll try to type another letter to you tomorrow before I go to school. I love you so much!Yours forever and always,Josh"
