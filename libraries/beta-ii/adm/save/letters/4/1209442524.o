__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Cb to Amun Tue Apr 29 00:10:52 2008:-----I've been gagged once before and unfortunatly it lasted 2 irl months.  Now I dont really seem like its propper to get pissed at me for saying im gagged on the board now is it?  I have personal reasons because of what happened to me before to remind Nulvect that I am gagged and i'm making sure he remembers it.  So yes I do think he has something up his ass. Also I wasn't trying to get things changed I was pretty much asking for a thing to show people im gagged."
