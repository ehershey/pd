__Letter "Stormbringer, I know you left the whole balanceing issue to Daboura, and so far he's done alot of good. But can you please explain to me how having daggers/knives and daggers/knives only be the type of weapon that breaks. So far since he put it in, I have broken 4 black daggers and 1 darksoul knife.
