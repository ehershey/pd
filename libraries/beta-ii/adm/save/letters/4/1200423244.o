__Letter "Any dream worth having has you at its root. The rose-colouredpresent, the ever-unknowable future...but with one such as you bymy side...no, you, by my side...fear loses all power. I am unsureif I will heed sleep's call right now or delay it long. I do hopeI will be blessed to hear from you soon.Love,Uza"
