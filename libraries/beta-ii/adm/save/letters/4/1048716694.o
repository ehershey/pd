__Letter "I hope your coach will get better, and its not weak to cry hun. Im here as much as I can if you need to talk to me, you can send me a mail or give me a tell if you see me online. I will send healing energies to your coach as I can and hope that she recovers.As for fighting, I dont want to fight anymore."
