__Letter "Just want you to know, if you start something with Chosen because of Vlad or Orcha or anyone else, you may find your guild in trouble. Chosen was transfered legally and going to war or pking them all will not be tolerated. They will not be punished for reviving a dead guild.... seems to me you of all people should understand this.Stormy"
