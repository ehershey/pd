__Letter "Scorpio are the strong power abusers of Primal Darkness. Mess with them and prepare to die. They will take your soul and devour it whole. Extremly envious they take what they want, but can't have.                                                                       Who keeps an arrow in his bow,                                                        and if you prod he lets it go?                                                        A perfect friend, a subtle foe-                                                                Scorpio!I don't know if that sounds o.k but, I think it sound o.k. I hope you were talking about the new guild help file though. lolMocha."
