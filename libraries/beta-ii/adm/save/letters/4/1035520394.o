__Letter "I'm seriously considering in booting him from the guild, not only did he break the contract that I set up for him, he went beyond his usual stupidity.  Not that we have outspoken guild ties with other guilds, but we had strong ties with three of the strongest guilds in the game, I would hate for one person to turn this around and we all be targets for no reason.  It wouldn't be fair to the rest of the guild that came in for fun, not to pk.I would like your input in this matter.  We have 30 days to decide on this matter.  This is as far as pyro goes, greg will stay in as long as he behaves himself.  If he becomes an idiot with that char, then we'll boot him out when the time goes.I'll be looking forward in your response in this matter.Hep"
