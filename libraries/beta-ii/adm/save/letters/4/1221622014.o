__Letter "apparently some rooms like the door at /d/freepk/merkkerri/jungle/merkkirri/tomb11, myrndrylls(?) door, and samuns(?) door do not re-lock themselves on reset. Of course, they're not supposed to be, with the current door system. I would recommend that rooms with special monsters in them that are supposed to be guarded by locked doors also lock their doors on reset(), maybe even on the line right before the monster spawns.Also, apparently lockpick tells you that a magical force prevents you from unlocking a door when the door is already unlocked."
