__Letter "Primal Darkness Inc.http://www.primaldarkness.comSeptember 28, 2002Dear Perspective Gamer,Boredom comes often in daily life. It's cold and wet outside and you have nothing to do inside.  You could play a game, but you never have enough money for the latest technology to run them.  And all of the old games can only be played so many times, or can they?  Welcome to the exciting world of the Primal Darkness Multipurpose User Dimension (Or MUD for short), a game that keeps on playing, a game that is forgiving of old technology and welcomes you to a user friendly interface filled with people all over the world that will keep a person entertained for years on end.If you were like me, the first question you had was, \"What exactly is a MUD?\"  The answer is simple a MUD is text only game you play over the internet. You do not install software, you do not need the latest video card or processor to play it, the fact that it is totally text means that any computer with any type of internet connection is more then able to handle the interaction between you and the server.  The server gives you output, and you provide input which will guide the game flow.  For example, the game tells you an imp has entered the room.  You don't like imps, so you want to kill it.  You type, \"Attack imp\" and the game will start its battle sequence where you can use skills and spells you have learned to kill the pesky creature. The game responds to you, making your adventure totally original and customized. In Primal Darkness, you are thrown into the middle of a chaotic holy war between Good and Evil.  Angels and Demons fight and die around you, each pleading, prying, or deceiving you, trying to get you on their side to give them the advantage.  Choose from one of twenty eight races, pick your class and subclass and dive into the waiting abyss, combine this with a friendly and willing to help group of Administrators of the game that will gladly answer any question you have to help you make full use of what is an adventure far beyond what you had ever hoped to expect.  Add an easy to learn and always evolving combat and class system and a small group of friendly fellow gamers and you are set up for one wild ride. \"But wait,\" you might say, \"If this game is played using words won't that make it boring?\" To answer this question, all you have to do is type MUD into any search engine to return a variable hailstorm of results.  Millions of people play thousands of MUD games all across the world, would they be very popular if they were boring?  MUD gaming was around ever since the advent of the internet, but despite the recent technological increases that allow for games with graphics that rival real life, MUDing had not slacked off, if anything it has grown in popularity. The reasons being are it's simplicity to learn it's interactive and non linear structure, the fact that there is no end, and possibly the best reason of all, it's 100% free.So, with all this who can possibly refuse to want to play Primal Darkness?  Join the good fight against evil, or perhaps become the ultimate evil yourself.  The possibilities are limited only by your imagination in the realm that is Primal Darkness.  Come to www.primaldarkness.com and start your adventure, today.Sincerely,Nathan RichardsPrimal Darkness RepresentativeIgnore the spacing.  It looks a lot better in word, heh.Just thought I would let you know what your permission has let me do."
