__Letter "yeah ive had the same spade for all the levels, i cant remember an exact time, i spoke to stormbringer about it. he said that the reason was that i was harassing carina and alts or something on spade. what happened was, that i logged carina and furiae using an anti-idle trigger, and we got into an argument after he didnt punish them, he said if he arrested them, he would have to arrest me too because he knows ive done things wrong in the past. i told him to go ahead id take one for the team (this was on chronicus), we argued and chronicus got arrested. after that i log onto spade, dont say a word over newbie or anything, im 99.9% sure i didnt say anything, especially nothing that would be considered harassment."
