__Letter "hey you,Thank you for such encouraging letters.  I know I would have to tell you sometime about the situation and whathappened, I think before it was just too painful for me to go into details.But, talking to you and Paul about it, helps me see that it wasn't myfault and that Nick needs help.  No-one wants him to get away with it,not that I want revenge, but no-one should hurt anyone in any way, shapeor form.  It's just not nice.  I know I'm lucky, finding someone as thoughtful and decent as you.I want to put all this behind me, so that I can start my life as it should be.Hope I can talk to you soon, and I will tell you some day about whathappened.  Maybe, when it's not so difficult to think about it.hugs,"
