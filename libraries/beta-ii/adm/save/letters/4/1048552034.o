__Letter "My goodness, this new character sucks. Dispell does nothing, whirl always misses, and jab does *very* little. I cannot wait to finally get some decent abilities. I was also dirt poor for a while, too. I was xping in the newbie forest because that was all i could handle without using lots of oils. But i soon ran out of money to *buy* oils and was forced to go fight the elven guards (who were harder and required oils). So i started a fight, beat up the guard for as long as i could, recalled back to the town squre to drink from the fountain until i was healed again, and then walked back to the guard, started fighting again, recalled again to heal, etc, etc, etc, until i finally killed him. I got almost 100 gold from selling his armor, but dang, that's just crazy. Right now i would go as far as to say that my level 6 sorceror could *easily* beat up a level 5 paladin. I mean, my sorceror can do much better damage and get through fights much quicker than my paladin. It doesn't make any sense, though...Hm...Well Ug tells me that the pally's first decent ability is slash, which you get somewhere between level 6 and 8, so i guess i won't have to live through this torture for too much longer. I'm level 4 atm, a little over halfway to level 5. Anyway, I shall be on as Eilistraee to see you tonight. I'll get on as soon as I can. Maybe then we can get a little bit of time to be together before you have to leave for work. Oh, i meant to ask you, did you rest well? I hope so, cause you sounded *very* tired. Well, that's it for now. I would give you my usual goodbye, but it just seems kinda odd doing that with my male character. Haha. *Waves* See you later on.Valdimar (Eilistraee)"
