__Letter "Ok, I think you're over reacting a little bit. I understand where you are coming from that I need to live up to my word. Now that I've actually broke my word and am sorry for it what else can you ask from me? I'm really not sure what to do and I'm starting to feel a little cornered. I'll try to do my best to keep my promises and I see the importance in it. We just need to either talk about it or maybe just drop it all together but fighting won't solve anything. If you really wish to pk me I guess I'll be forced to fight with you but I'd much rather just get along. I mean this is the first time I've really broken a promise to you. I just want to do what's right and I'm trying to learn how to not rush and to think stuff through before I do it but im learning and im changing and I'm doing my best. I'm sorryNoxus"
