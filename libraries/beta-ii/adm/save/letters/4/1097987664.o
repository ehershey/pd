__Letter "Hey Endbringer.I'd just like to say that I FINALLY got back, and Astrid will be back soon.If you need any help at all with the guild, I am more than willing to take on responsibility again.Sorry that it took so long to get back...once I got back from army training all summer, I found out that my ISP had BLOCKED Port 5000...\"because it was possible for virus to get through it..\" Ugh..idiots...Anyways, I'm back, so just ask for help if ya need it or want more people spread out.Bele"
