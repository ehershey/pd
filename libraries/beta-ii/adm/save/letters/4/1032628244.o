__Letter "Once again, you have caused my death.. would you mind not being a complete jerk about this and at least letting me have my rose back.. that actually does have some meaning to me.. Yes I realize that now that you know this you're going to want to bury it or something.. so if you do I can't stop you but just know that I'm asking nicely, and that it does mean alot to me both in character and out.Sugarcandy "
