__Letter "I really regret giving back the ring, i was really really hurting.  I know it's my fault, i haven't actually been very talkitive lately.  It's not like i'm jealous of Azire, i'm glad you have her and are happy, it's just the fact that i am so unhappy.I seem to be living in my own little world of pain, i'm really down and depressed most of the time and when that happens the world seems to revolt around me, if you don't talk to me, or say hello it's because i think you don't want me for a friend anymore and that really hurt.  It's not only you, i've driven hermes and most of my other friends away too.  The think is, i want to stop it and feel really good like i did tonight.Then suddenly i hit rock bottom, and that's what happened when you sent me that ?? tell, you didn't say hello  or anything but i get a ?? from youWho wants a friend who goes off at the drop of a hat, half the time i scare myself silly, i feel like i'm in self distruct mode.Where i use to talk to you, i don't talk to anyone, i feel like i'm in a void and everything it just moving past me so fast and i just want to scream.  I introduced a friend to the mud, he's a nice guy and it terrifies me that i'm going to fuck up that friendship like i have everything else i seem to touch.Sorry about all the typos and crap but i'm flat out seeing the screen, i'm just a sad attention seeking old cow, i don't deserve to be your friend, i don't deserve to be anyones friend, i am selfish, bitter and cruel.I sit here so many time just wishing you would talk to me or come to me like you use to but then i think why should you, i mean nothing to you, i would only bring you down.I haven't been a very good friend, i'm not a very good friend, you are far better off without me.  I even said happy birthday to you on the board but it doesn't matter now.I hate myself, why shouldn't everyone else hate me tooAnne"
