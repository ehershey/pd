__Letter "hey, i was informed that the scales in dragon warriors were only giving about 60hp heal.  I looked at the scale code and it looked good, but i couldnt find the inhert OIL code to even see what it looked like.  Was something changed or is it just a rare chance that the player keeps getting 60hp heal?  If there is anything more i can do, by all means I'll do it, just show me the path and I'm your girl!Thanks nul,Amun"
