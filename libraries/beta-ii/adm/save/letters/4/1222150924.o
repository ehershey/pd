The point is Rohl 'assumed' we came for thedouble team as it's the kind of thing he and Aethion would do andhe flew off the handle. We need to at least try to set up a timefor peace talks. But until we get that in, feel free to try to stompAethion a new mudhole altho Cowl says he can get aethion to chill.Later, manUza"
