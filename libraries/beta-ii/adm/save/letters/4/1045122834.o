__Letter "hey man..i really have a problem with wraith. for one he was accusing me of the IP thing. well whatever. that doesnt bug me REMOTELY as much as this:ok when he was asking me..about the whole hacking katuku or whatever their name is. last night. so i went on how kenjiru was using an invis immortal account (probably whit) to snoop people's stats/skills/equipment..he was showing me. i thought it was cool but in my heart i thought it was bad against the game so i mentioned it. thinking it had to do with this whole \"Me hacking katuku from my IP address issue\"i also said things..about kenjiru that i wasnt too fond of him but hes still my friend..and to keep all this private because i dont want him knowing it was me who got him in trouble for sake of our friendship.and i specifically said to keep it private. and the first thing i get when i sign on MSN is you fucking dogged me man from kenjiru implying that wraith straight up told him everything.i just dont think that is very good role as an immortal to do something like that when all i was doing was try to clear my name and also allow the admins to know that someone is cheating.i am very disappointed in his actions. maybe there is something you can do about this. since this is primarily your mud. you put a lot of heart and soul into this game. and i honestly dont think wraith deserves ANY credit whats so everlet alone my character is still arrested for NO reason.later tommie :("
