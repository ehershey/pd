__Letter "Hey dude, ive thought about this for a while, and i think the only one deserving of Forsaken is you.I cant trust anyone else's judgement like could with you.  You would make Forsaken great again, and i know i wouldnt have to worry...  Let me know what you think, and its not like i'd be leaving Forsaken I'd still be a member if yo'd let :PBtw Xaven wants to know if he can join, i havent adressed his request at all, just told him that Forsaken is going into transission atm~Yang"
