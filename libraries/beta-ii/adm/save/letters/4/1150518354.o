__Letter "Im not to sure whats going on, but i already talked to Daos about the Ying and Yang situation and he understood. He said as long as it doesnt happen again it was ok.  What happen was that my gf accidently logged on as Yang while i was logged on at work, the two never made contact and I logged off as soon as i saw Yang log in.  She wanted to tell me that her phone was locked in the car and she couldnt call me.  Pls send me back a mail, wanna know whats going on"
