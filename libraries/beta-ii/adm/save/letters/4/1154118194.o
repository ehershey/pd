__Letter "hey stormy I was wondering if theres anyway to look back on bugs abused in the past, I doubt it was logged so it'll be kind of hard. But anyways I killed rueznor today in a lawless, and he threatened me by saying \"I should tell stormy about that 5mil arma gave you, he abused a bug to get it\" well anyways, arma gave my alt perel 10mil out of nowhere one day, I didn't know if he abused a bug or not but he handed some other characters alot of money too. but I just want to say if it was bug abuse I can give you all of perels money back."
