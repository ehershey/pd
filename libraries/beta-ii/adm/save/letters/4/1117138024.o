__Letter "Short descThe Vampires rest place.Long descThis section of Vorticon Crypt is different than the main hall.The floor is covered with a strange grey sand and to yourexperienced vampire senses it is pulsing and emanates thehealing energy from the ancient vampire ages. Behind themagical bone grate you see a wall full of huge Ash Treedrawers... looks like a morgue... inside each drawer theVorticons rests and stores the most valuable item.At massive black table in front of grate sits Vuk'lak,he is here to check the items records and protect thevampires while they are in topor.Vuk'lak descVery skinny but with muscles of steel he never rests...nobody knows where he find blood to satiate his thirst.Maybe it comes from the mortals thieves... His red eyesraises from the items list and pauses over you. The lipsmoves and you see his sharp teeths while he speaks: \"Whatcan i do for one of our Vorticons?\""
