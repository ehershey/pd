__Letter "Hey man, I hope all is well with you. I am expecting a mail later todaywith more info about just what's going on and a brief plan about howwe can go about improving things. I don't expect it to be easy but I am a firm believer that there is very rarely ever a point of no return.So, drop me that mail and we can get started taking a turn for the better. :)James"
