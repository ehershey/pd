__Letter "Chosen was purchased from the staff because it was a dead guild. If you wish to kill them all that is your choice, just know if you hire someone to do it such as another guild, and they make one step over the harassment line, you will be deleted and banned for the harassment. It would be best if you dropped the subject and let things go.Stormy"
