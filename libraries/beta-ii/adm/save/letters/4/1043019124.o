__Letter "Hey honey. *kisses you sweetly* Sorry i couldn't say much in my last mail, but i wasn't really in a position to talk. How have you been? I've missed you. I just can't wait to head home about 24hours from now and get back home so I can really spend some time with you. You will be on that night right? I mean, I won't be able to see you until about 30 hours from now, or maybe a little later, but I will see you. I have to see you. I hope you can be on about that time. Like I said before, i'm still on my trip and I can only be on PD periodically and only for about 30 mins at a time. I haven't been able to catch you on, but I know I'll get to see you soon. Until then, I love you and can't wait to see you again. Savannahwhobah, sorry bout that, mis. "
