__Letter "Stormy,Using Ug as a control, I have conducted a series of tests with rage vs. greater rage.My results are rather encouraging.So far I've run into no troubles with rage, nor is it particularly overpowering.With regular rage the attack was 540 and defense was 213.  With greater rage the attack was 600 and defense was 220.  As you can see it is an increase without being overpowering.And it fits perfectly as when the berserker continues to level the margin of increase will be greater still without being overpowered.More importantly nothing bugs and works as it's supposed to do.Whirl disappears, instead Slash, Cleave, and Scare take their place.  It all works perfectly and in my opinion will make a great addition to elite berserkers.-Hermes"
