__Letter "Why ya think i been pretty much rewiring builders from theground up for you :)Ive been getting the place more builder-friendly and more securefor us. The changes ive done puts the projects on lockdown butat the same time gives control of those locks over the owner ofthe projects.Problem im having at the moment is that i have completed the helpfiles for the efuns and sfuns but need a CURRENT copy of the mudlibso that i can whittle thru it and do all the lfuns now. I can doit with the one on builders now but it wouldnt be current with theone here on the main port. My intention is to have the most currenthelp files that i can manage to write.Im willing to put in the hours but i need the files or a way toget the files myself.================================================================The next issue is the p-tester idea i've been working on. Myintention there is to drastically reduce and/or eliminate thebugs that the players keep having to find and report by havingdesignated people going thru completed areas LOOKING for thesekinds of inconsistancies. I do it now with my mortals but ithink it would be a good idea to have \"mortals\" looking froma player's perspective and not a builder's perspective.I just want a yes or no from you. Should i set up this kind ofprogram or just scrap the idea.================================================================Final issue is my needing you so i can teach you how to calibratethe security system to your tastes. I also want to show you someof the other work ive gotten done over there. We havent talked\"face to face\" in months and alot of things have piled up onme over there .........I'll be around most of the day. I know you dont have yahoo bute-mail me at ironman9z@yahoo.com to tell me your on. It willalert me and ill jump back on PD if im not on builders already."
