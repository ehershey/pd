__Letter "Hey Stormy, I was wondering if it would be possible to get a copy of the mud, with like just Tirun and no player saves or wiz folders or anything. I'd really like to have a platform to test significant changes on without having to worry about breaking it and having to wait for you, Whit, or NS to come around and fix it. Dab and I have a spare computer laying around that I'm going to get some variant of Linux on, so we could run it from there, restrict it to only allow LAN logins. If this is possible, contact me in game or mr_w@myway.com (my \"real\" email address - I use the other one for things I know are going to send spam).Thanks!--Nesoo"
