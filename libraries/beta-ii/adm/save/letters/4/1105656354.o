__Letter "Yesterday (or tuesday) I logged on to PD and got a message telling me to report a bug. The message came right after I logged in, I didn't have a chance to type anything. When I did type something and entered the command, the response was \"What?\" I couldn't talk, move, look at my inventory, or even report the bug. I had to log on my alt, Cosmo and had no trouble with him, n fact I even reported it as well. I logged off of Cosmo and relogged back in as Piehl. I had no trouble, but when I looked at my inventory, all of it was gone. the money was still there, but the inventory just disappeared(That's the only way I can describe it. One day it was there.. the other it wasn't.) I asked Daboura about it and he told me to send you a mail. Just in case you are wondering what I had in my inventory: 3 black diamonds. 2 black daggers, 4 wolf claws, shadow armour, white leather boots, white leather gloves. I also had a Demon helm, a merkkirri war mask, Skull bracers, and acrilite armour. The only new items I had in my invetory were the daggers. I've had everything else for a while. Not sure what happened, but I thought you might like to know... Thanks for taking the time to read this.-Piehl\"I have, I hold the key, to Nothing.\""
