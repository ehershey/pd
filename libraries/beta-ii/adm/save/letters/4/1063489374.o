__Letter "well, we need to set up a time when the both of us can come on....couple of things...1.  Did nightshade say if we came up with the spells, he'll do them for us??2. If so, you have any ideas what we can do to change some of them??3. I would like to get this quest in as soon as possible, I'm going to try to fix up the areas, I sent you the sentences, so I'm hoping you can help with that.4. I'm going to try and get wiz over here in the next week or two, I'm going to see if we can set the random room of which the quest starts, as a random in the forest instead of looking for a bunch of places....since the forest is a file of it's own, I don't see if there is a problem, but since I don't know a thing about coding, I may be wrong on this.5. Is there anything you want to remind me about in the quest before I get wiz over here.  We still need to find hiding places for the orbs, and dragons.  But to do this, I need to fix up the mazes with the proper descriptions.  I will try and set aside time everyday to acomplish this...I also need to buy some ink for the printer so when I can't get on the comp, I can at least print out the stuff and fix it so when I come on it won't take much time.6. Lets shoot for Halloween as the date to get all this done??? I don't care on this one, I think once I get wiz here to get the actual quest in place, everything else will fall into place......Oh crap, we need to set up the wall poem for the blue dragon, I will need at least which order to do the colors, I'll try and fiddle around with it.well that's all for now, Let me know about what time you usually come on, and I'll try and catch you on or something."
