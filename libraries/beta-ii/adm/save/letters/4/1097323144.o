__Letter "Bladedance is very broken! The extra hits do zero to players and as far as I can tell do zero to mobs as well. Now I've never seen an error message so it seems its always been this way. Now I've bugged venenum alot about this and he told me yesterday he had fixed the problem but was waiting on you to approve it. I'd realy like this problem fixed cause I've worked hard on this character and have nothing to show for it but a move thats does zero. :X Thanks for the time.Davyn."
