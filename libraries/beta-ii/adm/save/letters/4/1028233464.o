__Letter "Ok. The race is going to be a gnoll. The class an sub class is a mage and wizard. The name is The Scorpian King. I think I'm suppossed to think of a descrpition so here it is. Standing before you is the great Scorpian King. With his jet black hair and eyes he looks evil. His skin is deep tan from the sun. As you look at him he glares at you and you feel a sudden sense of dread.I think that's it.Oh wait I think they start out as lvl 10 so I want him to be lvl 12. One more question how do I max his skills?Luv ya,Mocha."
