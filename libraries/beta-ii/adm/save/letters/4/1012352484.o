__Letter "I dont know how much you want to charge for it or if you can make it into a guild item that only guild members can use with restore <item> on it, But I talked to seeker and he said he could pull the darksoul dagger from phase 1 so you wouldnt have to code the whole thing over again.Its supposed to be the same as the Bloodstones, but I dont know, never used one.thanks again man, great job with the guilds."
