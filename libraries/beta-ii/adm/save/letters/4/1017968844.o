__Letter "I'd like to balance all the weapon classes, armor classes/types, autoload levels of everything.  I cant do all that using ed, tho...  I tried to use the \"mud ftp\"...  got 2 directories, it crashed.  I wasnt able to ftp again til the mud rebooted...  got 2 more directories, then it crashed.  Plus it's reallly slow.  If you could set me up with real ftp, that'd be great.  I dont have a static IP...  can you just do an IP range?  I think I'm on a C class IP, so it'd narrow it down a bit.  Thanks.                 -Nightshade"
