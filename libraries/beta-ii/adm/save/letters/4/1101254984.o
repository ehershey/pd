__Letter "Hi there.  Not sure if this is in line with the bug I got when I tried logging in today (log included with next mudmail), but I wanted to see if I could get refunded the equipment which was lost sometime, obviously due to a bug.  I don't know how hard some of it is to get, but it would just make life easier for me.  I've included a log of what I had before the bug hit me.  Obviously the items that don't AL for me wouldn't need to be returned, but I hope the rest can.  Thanks.                     -%^GREEN%^Greeny+=+=( Inventory )=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+               Name                               Autoload   Weight+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+--------+| Knight's Shield (worn)                        |    Yes    |   15   || A Merkkirri battle mask (worn)                |    Yes    |   4    || Demon Mask (worn)                             |    Yes    |   5    || Acrilite bracers                              |    No     |   3    || Wizard Robes (worn)                           |    Yes    |   25   || Tahngarth's wedding ring (worn)               |    Yes    |   1    || Shield of Macbeth's Army (worn)               |    Yes    |   20   || A leopard skin loincloth (worn)               |    Yes    |   12   || A tiny blue shirt (worn)                      |    Yes    |   3    || Breath of Asmodeus (thirteen uses left)       |    No     |   2    || Two Ivory daggers  (wielded)                  |    All    |   16   || A backpack (worn)                             |    Yes    |   19   || Green and white cloak (worn)                  |    Yes    |   4    || White gloves (worn)                           |    Yes    |   3    || Spiked platemail (worn)                       |    Yes    |   58   || Wolfskin Boots (worn)                         |    Yes    |   10   || The newbie guide                              |    Yes    |   1    || Fine pants (worn)                             |    Yes    |   3    || A sapphire ring (worn)                        |    Yes    |   1    || Elven chainmail (worn)                        |    Yes    |   10   || A backpack                                    |    Yes    |   19   ||-------------------------------------+---------+-----------+--------'|  Total Weight: 90% (234/258)        |'-------------------------------------'Thanks again."
