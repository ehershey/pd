__Letter "Hm, seems like you hardly ever seem to be around when I'm telling everyone goodnight. Either you got disconnected for eternity forever ago or you go out to do something and then don't get back until after I leave. *ponders* Why is it always like that?Well anyway, I am off to bed now, and I thought I'd send you a mail saying goodnight. As always it's good talking to you. :) :)Oh, btw, I may get to come home a day early. W000T! :D That would be *soo* great. :)Jacie"
