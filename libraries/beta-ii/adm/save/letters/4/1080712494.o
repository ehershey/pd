__Letter "Just a heads up. There's a newbie that just got created named Blitz. At first I thought it was steven but it abviosly wasn't. The person pretended to be a newbie, but obviously wasn't. Cause he was talking on all the chat channels just perfectly and everything before his race was even chosen. *And* he logged off pretty mcuh immediately as he came online to create the char.I kinda doubt it's anything, but you never know.Weird, too..."
