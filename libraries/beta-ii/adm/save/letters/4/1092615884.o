__Letter "This is the room description for Scourge. Any of the old rooms can be replaced except for Aziraphale's room.Upon entering this mighty room at first you are near knocked offyour feet by the stench of rotting heads strung upon the walls, Dry blood andother fluids seep down leaving trails of black and yellow stains below whereScourge displays his trophies over the fallen enemies of Illuminati. In thecenter of the room is a large obsidian altar bearing a statue of the demon lordAsmodeus and around it a pentagram carved into the stone floor with runicinscriptions in the demon language. This room is disgusting,Certainly not a sight for the faint hearted.Thanks :)"
