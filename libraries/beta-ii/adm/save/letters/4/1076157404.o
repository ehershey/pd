__Letter "Dravin was born in the small farming community of Dhedluk in Cormyr. His childhood was a fairly normal one, playing with the other town children, and, when he was old enough, he helped out with chores on the farm. At the age of 14, Dravin got into an argument with one of the other children over which of them was the better hunter. Dravin lost his temper, and suddenly the other boy was thrown through the air without being touched. The community went into uproar about the use of destructive magic around their homes, and so the local cleric came in to divine the nature of this power. However, the cleric was unable to find any trace of the sorcerer's power within the boy, so pinned the event down to some form of demonic possession. So Dravin was brought into the temple and subjected to many exorcisms, in an attempt to drive away the evil spirit. However, after two weeks no progress was made, and still when the boy became frustrated or angry, things inexplicably moved or shattered.Being unable to wash away any taint from the boy, and fearing what would happen if he returned to his home, the temple gave him supplies to last him a few weeks, and bid he find his path within the wild lands around.Dravin spent the next few days wandering down a lonely path when one morning he awoke on the side of the path to find a stranger standing over him. This was man was Mi'kel, and he had heard the story of a possessed boy and tracked Dravin down.Mi'kel explained that he was a master of psionics, a power granted purely by the focus of the mind, and that Dravin had the spark of this talent too, that that was why he was cast out. Nobody understands the true power of the mind.So Dravin became Mi'kels new apprentice, and so learned not only the art of psionics, but also the way of the warrior, should ever his mental talent be inappropriate. The two of them spent five years wandering together, earning a living by protecting caravans traveling through particularly dangerous areas.Dravin learned much in this time, and eventually Mi'kel sensed that it was time for him to move on and find another apprentice. Thus, the two parted ways, and Dravin continued on his journey to find his true path, and the power that it would bring."
