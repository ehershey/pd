__Letter "The people I add on, I know them for over a year or more and I know what they can achieve.  As far as buddah is concerned, you have to ask him.  I do not know those people, but I'm sure he's done his homework before adding people in.  I like having all the new members in.  Hopefully they will contribute with ideas for the mud, the more people you have the more different ideas we gather."
