__Letter "Anne,  Ok, if that's what you are talking about, then I wish you would have let me know before now. If you have any questions about my char, let me know, and I'll give you the info you request so you have something to compare to. As far as dragons go, I partialy agree, and partialy disagree with you. I mean, there are many types of dragons out there... 4 or 5 I think. You, the red dragon, are the fighter, you have higher attack levels and defense levels in skills, but stat wise, you are probably the same as every other dragon. I don't think that is quite right. You, the fighter dragon, should be much more fighter attune, like con and str, and some dex. Take the healing dragon, either blue or white I think, they would be REALLY smart, way more than an elf, as a dragon they would simpy have higher st and con, but they wouldn't have the fighter dragons much higher str and con and dex. They stick with int, wisd, and charisma. Kinda like in real life. Not all humans are the same. Those who are \"fighters\" have lots of..training, they work out... aka strength, dex, and they typicaly learn to take hits, aka con. Then you have the intilectuals, they might dress nicer (charisma), they do much more studying in books and things (int and wisdom). Anyways, just my opinion. :)Ryan"
