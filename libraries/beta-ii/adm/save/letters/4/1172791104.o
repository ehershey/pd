__Letter "Hello Nulvect, How are you today?I am writing to ask you about marriage. I have been married to a character that has not been on for litterally a years time. I can not find it in the help files how to divorce or break the vow. Is there any chance of moving on or will I be forever wed to someone who no longer plays? Thank you,Dez"
