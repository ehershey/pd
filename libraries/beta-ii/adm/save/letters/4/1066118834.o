__Letter "dear petrarch and jewel,i am hoping you receive this email. i used to playmerentha a very long time ago. i was wondering if youcan help me recall my character name. i know it soundsstrange but for the love of me i can not remember itwas so long ago but one day i decided to see if themud was still active and WOW it has FLOURISHED!! somany players and areas..but i miss my good oldcharacter. i do believe i remember my password. theemail on my character is no longer the right onebecause i do not use aol anymore. if you can help meout i would really appreciate it. i heard you might beable to recover it using some sort of player databasesearch engine? i will give you some criteria of mycharacter. it was level 10->20 in between theresomewhere. i am pretty sure it started with an \"S\" buti could be mistaken. she was an assassin, and ibeleive she was a elf or possibly even a human. herage is somewhere between 47->51 according to myfriend's character. also on the real name it might saysarah, my name is sarah painter. well thank you bothvery much if you consider this as i was veryinterested in the game it was fun and now i am dyingto play once again. thank you very much.sincerely,Sarah Painter :)"
