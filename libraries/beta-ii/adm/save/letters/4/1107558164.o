__Letter "Hmm Well since the hall is supposed to be a ship and my designs will follow that. The room we have now is the deck and houses the board. From there I want a room up leading to the crows nest where I would like a scry room. Now down from the deck is the Galley. This room I would like to serve 2 functions. One I would like a locker room to store stuff in and second I would like a mob that sells drinks. It fits in with our theme and would help us generate more rp. Now the galley will have three more exits. West will lead to the bow of the ship where a mob will sell our guild oil/stones. East from the galley leads to the stern where a mob will sell our guild items(only want like two) Now down from the galley will be the hold of the ship and this room can serve as out treasury. I am more than happy to build these rooms etc (and have started in fact) but I qouold like to know if this is all possible before I spend the time. Thanks for the helpCaptain Davyn"
