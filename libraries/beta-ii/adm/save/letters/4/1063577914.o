__Letter "I think the title says it all.  ;)  I hear on last newbie that you've got lots of work to do for class.  I hope you're able to finish it all and still have some time to relax.  I'm just hopping on before running off to work.  *sigh*  they even cut our breaks in half...  now we get 2 during our 12 hours of work :(  Just wanted you to know I was thinking of you (I usually am...)  I'll catch you sometime soon hopefully *smile*  Take care.                -Paul"
