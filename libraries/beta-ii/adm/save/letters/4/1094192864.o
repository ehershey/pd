__Letter "I think throwing in random status effects with blade dance would be pimp..mybe the more cuts you get the more likely the effect, things like para, trip, drop in skills stuff like thatalso if we can have cannons on our ships, swashies should be able to have some form of pistolit really makes sense.. i mean a VERY simple pistol is very likely to exist in a world withmagic and wizardry and shite like thatan opening move involving the pistol which renders a certain limb useless, if the arms are hit u cant attack or cast spells, if your legs are hit you lose sp really fast, if your torso is hit, you lose mana and are paralyzed for the first roundalso they should be able to recruit mobs = to thier lvl based on entertaining and charisma, maybe that mob will follow them for an amount of rooms equal to thier lvl or somethin like thatthe mobs only attack and they react uponm your actions, you cannot order them"
