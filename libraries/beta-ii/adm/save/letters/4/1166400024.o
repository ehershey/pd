__Letter "I decided after this failure that i would perfer Whit to do theaddition into the master.c and/or BuildSecure.cThe access system is to fragile for someone to do without serveraccess in case something goes wrong. The simulefuns in the file/adm/simul_efun/security_screen.c control the system.security_screen_read(obj,guest);security_screen_write(obj,guest);security_screen_scan(obj,guest);obj can be either the filename or the object it refers to.guest is the person that the security_screens are being asked about.They will return 1 for granted or 0 for blocked.Don't worry about the scan one.... the only commands that need thatis _summary.c and _objcmds.cIronman"
