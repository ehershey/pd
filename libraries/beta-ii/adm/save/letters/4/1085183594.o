__Letter "Shame on you for continuing to reprimand Kumi. She has done nothing wrong, she talked to Stormbringer about it, and you know Stormbringer. He understood that she was wrongfully acused, and let her off, and she even posted an appology to the immortals that she might have offended even without being told to, because she did not realise that people do not think the same way she does... shame on you.."
