__Letter "Hey, well this is about me turning into a lvl 5 child. i dont know the rules for this but ive been dying qutie abit. ive been elite with this char atleast twice i have put alot of effort into this char becoming a demon and then getting to elite again. im lvl 42 now :P. im quite bored of anti-paladins and fighters and i want to try another class. but to do that i need to get another elite. becuase i want to be a demon. so not to waste this char i was wondering if you would make me a lvl 5 or lvl 1 child so i can go pick me class again. You can do this whenever if possible i dont have to be on. I also would like if possible to keep a majority of my stats since i have gotten them up again after becoming a demonIf you have to deduct stats i will understand but i would like to keep as much of my str and dex as possible since they are my highest and prised stats :)Well whenever you can do this or if you cant talk to me or mail me or somethin :PWell thanks!! :)and grats on a addictive mud "
