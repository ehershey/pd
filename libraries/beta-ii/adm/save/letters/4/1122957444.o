__Letter "Race name: ThestralLanguage they Speak:  EsoliganThe monsters of this race are more like horses than anything; They seem to wear thier skeleton on the outside.  They have vaporish white eyes, and they have wings.  They are very intelligent and are great with directions.  They are not easily tamed but are nice to people ingeneral.  They are invisible to those that have not witnessed a death, (that is just a lil bit of information).  They are big and strong and would be great fighters.  If you would like more info, I can get it for you.Thank you,Carina"
