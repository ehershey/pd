__Letter "I have noticed from studying the security system on builders thatEVERYTHING points directly to BuildSecure.c instead of accessingthe master()->valid_read() and master()->valid_write().This was having the affect that the access.db was being totallyignored. I will be changing the system around as follows;    1) Commands that scan info off the objects will use       security_screen_scan() for the test.    2) Commands that only allow reading of the file will be changed       to master->valid_read(). This will allow both access.db and       security_screen_read() to do their jobs :)    3) Commands that allow writing to the files; like cp, mv, and       ed; will use master()->valid_write(). Again this will allow       the access.db and security_screen_write() to do their jobs.Valid_write() and Valid_read() both call the BuildSecure.c so therewas no reason for the commands to be referancing it directly likethey were. They affect of BuildSecure.c was the same as valid_write()anyways. I'm just returning control to valid_write() and making thatfunction call it. I will have backups of everything so it can beundone if my testing of the new designs prove to have holes that areunwanted.I will be testing each command extensively with Ironman, Scrappy andScooby as i alter them. I will leave nothing to chance.Ironman"
