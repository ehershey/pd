__Letter "Just had a quick thought on exp balance at higher level monsters (my recurring topic I know lol).It's around lvl 45 that the higher stats/hp/level of the monsters seem to really slow down exp rates compared to when people use zones with lvl 25 monsters and then lvl 35-40ish monsters (rhondale primarily). Level 45+ monsters really are much slower and more dangerous and require more time spent healing up afterwards.Here's what I propose for exp values to compensate for the higher danger and longer time spent killing/healing.Monsters under lvl 45:   like it is now (lvl x 1000)Monsters over lvl 45:   Levelx1000 + (level-45)x1000So a lvl 50 monster would be worth 55k. A drow archer (62) would be worth 79k. The crazy hard lvl 80 purgatory monsters would be 115k.This way exp would scale up a bit better and would encourage people to exp in zones that aren't rhondale. We have a lot of great zones for higher level players and I think this would encourage people to make use of them more. With this change exp rates in those zones would be on par with what people could get from inferi swamp at lvl 40 and rhondale at level 50.My morning thoughts :-)"
