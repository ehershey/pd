I wish there was something I could say to get you to stay with us and make this place better. As for the bugs and such I am sorry I put those on you. If it will keep you here I will take them over and let you take spells/abilities or anything else you want. But I know you have your own idea of what a mud should be and PD wil probably never be it. I know there still exists alot of unbablance but we have wiped alot of it out since opening. The problem is we opened before we fixed every single thing. I do want to talk to you about starting another from scratch. I think we could get seeker to set up a base NM with little to no mods and have it hosted on the same server as PD using whatever name you wish. After all the help you have given us, it is the least we could do. I will talk to seeker about it if you are interested. I would even be willing to help if you want it. I am sorry to see you go, you have sone more for this place than even me. I am glad to have been a part of your growing experience in coding LPC and hope you someday come up with that complete balance you are looking for, personally I do not know that it can be done but if it is, I think you would be the person to do it. Again thanks alot for all your help and I wish you would reconsider.StormyTommyStormy"
