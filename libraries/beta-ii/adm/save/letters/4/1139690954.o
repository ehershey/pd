__Letter "This is the eye of hell. Where the minions of darkness gather and plot on the destruction of demons. The walls are coated with fresh blood. The ground squishes as you step, feeling like dead bodies. Skulls seem to be the only lightsource here.Look blood- It is fresh blood. Deep crimson in color. Your not sure where its comming from.Look Skull- Its an ogre skull. There is a black candle giving off a green light inside.Look skull 2- Its a skull of a human. There is a purple candle giving off a green light inside.Look ground- The your foot sinks a little with each step. The ground is covered in some sort of blackish icker.Smell- The smell of corroding corpses fill your nostril.Sound- It seems quiet except for the occasional soul falling from grace."
