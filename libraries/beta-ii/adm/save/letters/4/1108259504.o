__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Faust to Leviathas Sat Feb 12 17:12:30 2005:-----Well, Behaston the demon, known as the devour of worlds, was put to sleep. It cannot be destroyed tho mortal and angel alike has tried. He was controlled by Asmodeus himself and took order's from Asmodeus only. Soon, the world was in danger with Asmodeus leading an invincable army of demons. With the mortals in danger, the angels interfeared. They attacked Behaston with 5 books, The book of Earth, given to the mightiest Fighter. The book of Water, given to the Wisest Mage. The book of Air, given to the cleverest Rogue. The book of Fire, given to the kindes of Clergy and the book of Void, given to the most courageous Wanderer.With these books, they took the 5 basic essences of Behaston, tearing apart his soul instead of his body. Behaston eventually fell asleep from his soul being torn from his body. Asmodeus then sent out his minions to find these angels and destroy them. With the number of angels dwindling, the demons grow closer, Untill, Several of the demons found that with the books, you can control Behaston. Those demons broke from Asmodeus' minions and searched for the books on their own instead of returning them to Lord Asmodeus.Once the 5 books are found and opened with the ritual of several demons and a human sacrifice (your the human sacrifice). Behaston will be revived and destroy the world. Filling the pits of Hell with the souls of all he destroys.This is just a thought"
