__Letter "Hi, I have been keeping this inside me for awhile, because I didn't knowhow you would react.  But, a friend of yours - Kon - seems to thinkyou'd take the news happily.I have been in your presence for awhile now and in my heart, I knowthat I have never felt like this before.I wanted to tell you that I love you and I hope this news won't make you run away.  I just had to tell you, because my heart is burstingwith love for you.Normally, any mail I send out is full of fun, jokes and such, but thisone is serious.I felt I needed to say it, hope that is okay.Xenia"
