__Letter "I dont want to be rude or anything, but right now I'm kind of pissed.A demon anti-paladin with less dex and just a fwe more strength than me insta killed me with gore. A 900 hp gore. 900 HIT POINTS. MY THRUST DOESNT EVEN DO THAT MUCH.Sorry I'm very angry that a balance issue like that is on hold in place of something like slash, which isn't half as bad. The balance is so pushed towards demons that it's unbelievable."
