__Letter "Envy and a few of her other Alts have been searching for the Kataan Hall for 3 months. I remember asking you over Cre what to do with a player who just couldn't seem to solve a particular subclass quest, you said that you've given hints, and even guided some through. Tonight Envy was going to give up her long struggle to become Kataan, so i brought her to the kataan Hall. I suggest that we look over the kataan helpfile. I would be willing to write a rhyme/riddle extra hint .. if someone will tell me the way through the quest. I hope i haven't blundered, but i take full responsibility if i have. ~Azire~"
