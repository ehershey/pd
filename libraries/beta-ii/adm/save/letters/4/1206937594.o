__Letter "i was in purg getting things for a player and i was trying to fight a purg guard and notice soulburn plague deathtouch don't work for them i used missile on the guard and it worked but i'm not sure anymore what spells are elite now since everything has been modified for necros i know the guard is undead but would be nice if an elite spell would work against it. i asked amun and she said i needed to ask you about that she wasn't sure why so i thought i would ask you to see if there is anything that could be done... if not that's cool"
