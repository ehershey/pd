__Letter "Hey dude, got a favor to ask you. I am running short on money this month due to the trip we took and I am coming up $45 short for the server payment. I was wondering if you could loan it to me until the end of the month. If you can just send it to me through paypal and I will send it back to you near the first of December. If you can't don't worry about it, I totally understand and will do something else.ThanksStormy"
