__Letter "I dont quite understand why i had to mail you, but now i did. I really want unholy to exist because it's the only guild i like. and it has got awesome players in it + i've been here so long. so, please consider changing leadership.. I can rule unholy if theres no other active players. as far as i know there arent.Enska"
