__Letter "KK Here is my vortex balance.A few side notes: Remove hellfire from kataans and use it for another class. my upgrades to impale and dakzhul will carry kataans to level 30 nicely where demonfire is a good spell for them. Their area attack will just be vortex at lvl 50.Add 2 rounds of delay to the current round for a 3 round delay after casting. Big damage for big risk.dmg  tp->query_skill(\"faith\")/2 +tp->query_skill(\"summoning\")/3 +tp->query_stats(\"wisdom\")*3;dmg + tp->query_skill(\"magic attack\")/2;dmg + tp->query_stats(\"intelligence\")*2;dmg - (ob[i-1]->query_skill(\"magic defense\")/4);dmg -(ob[i-1]->query_stats(\"wisdom\")*2);dmg + random(this_player()->query_level());That should do it. Does 700 damage to a 25k mob with 80 int/wis at lvl 50 for 3 rounds of delay (thus 233 per round) or 900 with 120 int/wis at lvl 50 (300 per round).This makes it a somewhat weak area attack, but the big initial damage makes up for this along with a kataan's other useful abilities"
