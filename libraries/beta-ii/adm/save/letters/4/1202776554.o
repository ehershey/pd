__Letter "We havent spoken in quite awhile and no one has told me what(if anything) has been going on.....Please give me an update so i know what i have to do for PD :(That's part of the reason i want a token post on the main so imnot outta the loop like this. I haven't even heard from Daos inages.I know you wish my focus on running the builders port for you.That is where i WANT my focus as well. I like it over there :PI just ask to be kept informed as to developements at least.I would be mainly focused on builders unless you or nulvectspecifies somthing that needs help over here.Ironman"
