__Letter "I was just wondring if the vorticon guild could buy some stuff soon. We want to get basically locker rooms, scry room, prayer room, stone/oil shopkeeper and portal rooms aka sorta basic guild stuff to get on par with other guilds. All of which i can put them in the proper format over builders so you don't have to do much :). but also get some more custom guild items such as some armour and weapons etc. I have coded most've the ones we want over on builders and checked that they work and are bug free."
