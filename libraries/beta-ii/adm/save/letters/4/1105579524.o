__Letter "Daos.. All of my eq just disappeared. I'm not joking. When I first logged on, I got a message telling me to report the bug.. but I couldn't even use the bug command, or any other command (quit including) I logged off, got on an alt, tried reported the bug on him and logged back in. I could use the channels and commands and stuff once more, but my eq was all gone. I don't know what else to do.. and thought I'd let one of the Immortals know.. I just took a wild guess at who would deal with this kinda stuff.Sorry to bother you with this, but thanks for reading it.--Piehl\"I have, I hold the key, to nothing.\""
