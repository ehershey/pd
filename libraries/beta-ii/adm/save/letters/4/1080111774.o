__Letter "Hey, for the changes command, can there be a way to clear the list? It gets bloated after a while. Maybe something like changes erase or clear all or something.BTW, Nice job on the Primal Council thing, it makes things less dramatic, and actually makes the mud seemed more organized and professional somehow.On a more personal note: I hope you're doing okay. I know things have been rough lately.*hug*-Jen"
