__Letter "I would not restore his character.  I dont really care if you unban his name, but i wouldnt give it back.  What hes not telling you is that he was one that abused the coin bug, than after being banished continued to harass through proxies for some time.  I know hes been around and hasnt really been causing trouble, but i dont think players like him.  He can almost be as bad as cenn, and at least Cenn has matured somewhat.Whit"
