__Letter "Where to start, where to start....Well I liked your idea with trip cause I think something needs to be done with it. Players can stand as soon as it hits without losing a round. To me thats just wrong. I think a 1 round para would be better. That way it would  be the same with mobs (which it is handy against I'll give you) but when hits players they are para'd for that round with chances to break it like other para attacks.now Disarm has much of the same problem, works good for certain mobs with nasty weapon specials, but players can just re-weild the instant it hits.  An idea i had was that they  were disarmed for that round anf instead of their melees it says 'You scrambnle for your dropped weapon!' or something like that, but both my trip and disarm ideas will never see the light of day most likely.:PNow on to Bladedance. Niw I like Bladedance, I like the way it looks and I like the idea of it butt....it could use a little work. The damage is mediocre esp. towards pkanother thing is at lvl 37 i can do a maxixmum of 5 hits. and when all 5 hits go off its almost decent damage but alot of times I  average 2-3 hits. I think the frequewncy of higher hits could be turned up a wee bit..On a side note swashie def isnt the greatest but I was wondering if Bastets could get boots to wear. I mean puss in boots cmon!!! anyway thats my 2 cents anything i didnt mention is fine(like flash).Davyn Bashere - the dashing hero."
