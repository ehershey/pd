__Letter "Message 7 by Aldur: Demons=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=this is my post.. or probably end up as a novel about what i think demons couldbe improved/balanced... so anyway first of all horns are kinda annoying, theyare hard to armour, and they make me take more dmg, but when i think about it..horns are just armor in themselves, i don't think they should take any damage.Now there is the obvious suggestion of massacre and gore. They are veryunderpowered. Gore is like a weak rush, massacre is just slow and annoying. I'mthinking something to help all the evil classes, kataan, antipaladin,assassin.. kataan don't have it to badly in the fact they can massacre andvortex/demonfire/hellfire in the same rounds.. so i guess massacre is ok, butgore.. well its useless for everyone, so i'm thinking have it upgraded a bit..like make it like swipe was... like double attack+lvl, then i guess againstplayers half that.. i don't know what the coding was for swipe but it workedwell, it prolly shouldn't have been as good for weimics but for dragons.. itwas very good.when i say half that, thats just the PvP reduction.um for assassins, i don't know what they need since i really haven't playedone... but keep massacre for the kataans, upgrade gore for us fighters.Terror: a paralyzing ability where the demon scares the foe using our charismavs. opponents wisdom. can be used during battle. rounds of paralyze = (demonscharisma + level vs wisdom) then divide it by 10.terror could also be used on whole rooms for a 2 round para max.Assault: A Voilent attack unleashed by a demon to start combat, the demon usesthe super-natural speed to catch the opponent off guard and deliever severaldevastating blows.Number of hits = lvl/10dmg per hit = 2*str + (attack/5)Sp cost: 50 sp per hitlGore: sp cost: 3*level--More-- (74%) Damage: 2*str + attack + level + dexterity - defense/5 so for me to me that'ddo..615 dmg to a mob, and 307 to a player, its a tad bit better then slash, asit should be.please look at these carfully we need some sort of upgrade.thanks.=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+="
