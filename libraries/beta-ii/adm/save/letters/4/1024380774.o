__Letter "Well, heres the problem, Cookie's program lagged out so he went ld right before the mob killed him. He came back on and I found all his stuff in the freezer where his corpse had gone.I told him id give him back his stuff and report this to you for a decision. Whether to let him keep his stuff or forfiet it all.Here is a record of our conversation:Cookie tells you:can you do something for me? I need you to check and see if mystuff is in the \"freezer\" or \"linkdead\" room...You reply to Cookie: go ld againDagmar tells you:this is an alt I can use... is it there?You reply to Dagmar: yhea, its thereDagmar replies: can you give it back to my char or something?You reply to Dagmar: dunnoDagmar replies: can you teleport me there to pick it all up if I log back on?You reply to Dagmar: nopeDagmar replies: umm... then how can I get my stuff?You reply to Dagmar: ive gotta find out if its cool for me to get your stufflike thatDagmar replies: ok...You tell Faust: how was your first day?Cookie tells you:so... is it cool?Faust replies: alrightYou tell Cookie: it'll cost yaCookie replies: Cost me what...Cookie replies: considering it should have gone right in the room i died in...but didn't... and I could have reclaimed it for free... what will it cost me?You reply to Cookie: whyd you go ld?Cookie replies: Honestly... I lagged BIG BIG BIG time... and sometimes it'sgmud's fault... so I closed the program, and opened it back up. I popped backup where I was... with only 330 hp, which was odd, and no stuff. I didn't evenknow I had died.Cookie replies: I had to have ashram tell me... so then I saved, quit out...went and prayed... healed, and went back, and no stuff. That's when I asked youif it was there.You reply to Cookie: allright, hers the deal, Im going to give you back yourstuff on a temporary basis till stormbringer can get a look at the problem(thishasnt happened before that I know of) If he deems that you lose all your stuff(I have a copy of what I retrieved) then it will be dested from your inv. If hedeems that you KEEP your stuff, you owe me 1.5 million goldCookie replies: 1.5 million!You reply to Cookie: specialized services from an imm dont come cheapCookie tells you: Freakin' A! That's alot... *mutters and sighs* It was a bug!When stuff disapeared before when we had the other bug about your inv, I got mymain stuff back for free via NS...You reply to Cookie: this time there was no bug, you went LD right when the mobput you at neg hps, your body died in the freezerCookie tells you:Talk that price over with stormbringer as well... but fine...give me my stuff, talk to him about it, figure out what you wanna do with itand all, and talk prices then hit me up.You reply to Cookie: mebbie stormie will have me give it to you for free, dunnoyetCookie replies: *nods*Let me know whats up."
