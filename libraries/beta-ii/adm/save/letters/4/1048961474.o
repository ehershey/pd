__Letter "Bah, when i went away for so long there it was because i got dropped and had to reboot both my computer and the router computer. And then when i came back to say hi it had appeared you had already left. *cry* I suppose you thought that since it was well past the time i said i would leave that i simply just wasn't going to come back after being gone for longer than just a few seconds. *cry* But that's okay. I understand. I suppose by now you are sleeping, though I'm going to stay online until 11, which is a little less than 10 more minutes, just to be sure. If i haven't spoken to you by then, then here's my goodbye for today: Eilistraee grasps you behind the neck and pulls you to her for a sweet, but passionate kiss. As she pulls away, she smiles at you and says \"I love you and i shall see you tonight.\" And with that she is gone. Love,Heather"
