__Letter "HeyaI'm finally in a position to start playing again and I'd really apreciate if I were set back to level 37. That way I can get back into the rythym of no exp cuts. :) Becuase at the moment I'm just getting bent And I really don't want to die back to 37 cause I've just suffered 2 deaths to my stats and skills. I never presume to tell you what to do, or how to do things. But it would be really apreciated, hopefully I can get back into my no-life mudding lifestyle ;)ThanksHalo\\."
