__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Flash to Hepualahaole Fri Dec 27 15:24:17 2002:-----(Now, in this mudletter, I would like a little paragraph of what you expect from this guild,) : Ok, this is not going to be easy, so i will try my best. ok, lets see... i expect fro, this guild whenever someone is wrongly attacked by another player then the other from the guild avenge that person, when someone dies, another guild member helpfully asks the other if he/she needs help, and if so, follows through on his/her helping attempt. i also expect good will towards all others in the guild, for example, no yelling at another person in the guild for no reason at all, if they did not do something to merit this reaction. and from the leaders to be helpfull and not explode at another player for not knowing something, unless common sense would have made the other person know that.(and what you think the guild will expect of you.) : I believe the guild will expect of me to be very helpfull, to donate money to the guild tresury when needed, to help with ideas and finding things for other players. Also i believe it is a mandatory to do whataver a ranking person deems necissary for me to do, despite my own judent. i am expected not to complain without reason, and if i feel something isnt right, to talk to a ranking person in the guild. And if i have a personal quarrel with another in the guild, it MUST be resolved, or i must resigne or be forced to resigned. i have also learned that the guild has a strict no s*it policy, dont expect the guild to pull you out of a hole that you have fallen into, you should have been watching the ground in the first place.(is I want to seewhere this guild will be heading as a whole,)                                                : I believe that currently the guild is backed up against the wall, and will nopt survive long part of the fact that the members are basically only in for the \"spiffy\" line and the lockers, wishing no part in actually participating, many will sweat trying to fake up a valid mail to you. but suddenly a rope has dropped from the sky to pull us out of this corner, namly a reshifting of positions for leaders of the guild that are on more and azires shift to immortal. but still we need more.I hope you find that satesfacory, i did that all by my own, no-one helped me do it, but i believe that next time people should come to me for help, maybe a 20 yr. old person should seem to have better ideas."
