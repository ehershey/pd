__Letter "I don't think I can remain an Imm.Firstly: I keep getting drawn into things from having been a player, and having friends that play.Second: I don't have alot of computer access at the moment so I can't get on as much as I need to.Third: People asking me all of the time on what I am doing, or commenting on how I haven't really done anything. It is frustrating, especially since I have to save up over $1000 to get enw computer parts.Finally: I'd just rather play, there are people I want to help now, but I can't.So if it is possible could I get my old character back? If not I'll just start at level 1 again, again.I'll still do something on builders. - Aziraphale"
