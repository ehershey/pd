__Letter "Four men sat down to play,They played all night ‘till break of day.They played for gold and not for funWith separate scores for everyone.When they came to square accounts,They all had made quite fair amounts.Can you the paradox explain,If no one lost, how could all gain? Answer for another prize.sugar"
