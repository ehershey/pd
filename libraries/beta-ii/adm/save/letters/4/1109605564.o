__Letter "I was traveling from 8am until 11pm yesterday, on my way back to Ohio. Flights cancelled or delayed, driving to the airport in time for the security thing, and so on.I'm in Ohio until... Thursday night / Friday, then taking a few days off to rest, then back late Monday in ME.If you can use AIM, that's really the best way to catch me. Waliing is a good ID to hit.I tend to forget to turn Trillian on, and MSN by itself, when I'm on dial-up, is pretty lag-inducingTag. :)"
