__Letter "I had an idea pop in my head overnight for ther weapons. wanted toget opinions from you two about it before i code it in.What if the weapons bleed the player to level up ?? I mean that theydrain off stat points to do so. Level 2 would cost 2 stats. level 3costs 3. etc. This would keep the cost of leveling the weapons growingat a majorly high rate. Point is to keep the second and third rune slotslocked out until they have made substantial investments into the weapon.If you like the idea, i would also want you opinion on the following;   1) would the stats be targeted from most expensive on down ??   2) would the player choose what stats to sacrifice ??   3) would the weapon randomly choose what stat to hit for each point ??Personally i think option 3 is best. like to go from level 10 to 11, thesystem would randomly choose which stat is subtracted for each of the 10points being sacrificed.I think this would make people think twice about trying for more rune slots.I'm thinking of the following setup;   1) lvl 0 >> 4 == no slots  , WC == 5   2) lvl 5 >> 10 = 1 slot , WC gains 1 point per 2 level   3) lvl 11 > 15 = 2 slots, WC gains 1 point per 3 levels   4) lvl 16 > 20 = 3 slots, WC gains 1 point per 5 levels   5) lvl 21 > 30 = 4 slots, WC gains 1 point per 5 levelsIf you do the math, the costs to get to level 21 would be very steep indeed.Please get back to me asap guys. Also CC your reply to eachother as well."
