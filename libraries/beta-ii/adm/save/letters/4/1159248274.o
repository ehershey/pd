__Letter "Hey bro. This is Phyre from merentha. I want to start playing Warcraft 3 again but I tried to get on tonight and you were using my cd key. If you want to keep using it, give me your number or something so I can call you and tell you I want to get on. That way we could both use it because I don't use it that much.Anyway, best way to contact me is email - whereismynose@yahoo.comOr if you want you can try my cell - 803-466-3788My AIM is iamanewbeginning and my MSN is whereismynose@hotmail.comI'm usually not on a messenger very often though, but I check my email at least once a day and I always have my phone on me.-Phyre"
