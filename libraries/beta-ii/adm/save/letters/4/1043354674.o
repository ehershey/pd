__Letter "Woot! I was able to get my cha up to 29 all today. I think that's the fastest i've ever improved a stat. Now i've started working on con, which i think is going to take a while. But I will get there eventually. Also, i finally convinced my best friend to come back to PD. :) Don't know if you remember her, her mud name was Harmony. Hopefully she'll stick around this time. Well, I'm kind of burnt out on xping and there's no one here to talk to. So I'm probably going to log off for a while and come back in an hour or two. *Savannah kisses you sweetly and smiles before winking and vanishing to the shadows.*"
