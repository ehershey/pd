__Letter "I have achieved the level of 20. I think that that is the minimun requirement of your guild. I would like to join your guild because even though I am evil, I do not wish to join Unholy, or Darksoul. The other guilds are not right for me either. I wish to join your guild because I think your guild suits me and I know people in there and I like them.If you would please mail me back or tell me if I am able to join, I would much aprieciate it.Vampira- servent of Asmodeus."
