__Letter "Gabriel was charged with 2 counts of murder while in teh arena, It was witnessed by 2 or 3 other players and reported to me. He did not die but lost his Eq. Some of the players think it was because of him using holy fire. I shut down the arena and am going to get an eq update from him when he ever gets it through mudmail."
