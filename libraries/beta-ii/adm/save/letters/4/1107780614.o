__Letter "After being awoken by my daughter to kill some bug at 2am whilst in the midstof a really cool dream where i was a red dragon and was killing some Knightcalled Law...something i can't get back to sleep grrrr.Basically i'm not one of those whingers that complain that this isn't buffenough, i want a new spell/ability and that colour is wrong cry cry have somecheese.  I simply play the game, i don't know off hand how much my skills costand how many i get per level.  I don't know what it takes to make things workand in all honesty i don't really want to know that, i just wish to play mycharacter and enjoy myself.Now with that said i'm going to tell you sp is killing me :p  yes i can play,yes it works but after killing a mob i generally spend the next 2 minutespumping ointment to replenish my sp.  Get more dex i hear you say.... My dexisn't bad and one thing i've noticed is the more dex you have the more you use.Seeing the Gobbish decided he would go Demon i've been playing a cleric and ialso have a druid which is pretty cool too.  I don't generally like to comparecharacters and stuff and now i can see this might start to get on the longishside because it's 2am and i can't sleep :p  Doe is pretty good basically killkill kill and occassionally give the stone a rub.  Wildsilk as far as killinggoes is pretty ok too at level 36 before i took her elite she was killing thesame stuff Wisp can and again she can xp Wisp under the ground doing full roomskill kill rub stone.  None of my other characters are anything over the top,they work and i can pretty much continuiously xp without having to stop andwait where i have to with Wisp to replenish my Sp.I have partied with other dragon colours and they don't have the same problemand neither they should, Dragon's in all rights are fairly wise and intelligentcreatures all they have to do is rub stone.  Again i've partied with differentclasses, now pretty much everyone knows (unless you want a challenge) to make afighter/rogue you pick a race that has cheapish dex/con and if you are going tobe a mage/cleric you go for the wiser abilities.  Red Dragons don't have thatchoice, they are stuck into the mould of every dragon colour who have not greatsp and pretty good wis/int costs.Now with that said i'm going to make a new post with some ideas as not to makethis one not even longer.Wisp"
