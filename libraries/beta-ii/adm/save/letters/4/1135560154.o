__Letter "Idea reported by Azire Mon Oct 14 13:31:27 2002/d/tirun/pier2: random whale attacks on the fishing pier.. you get pulled intothe water and tossed up on the beach near arlon. heeNow I know this sounds like guild wars, but it would be a good idea, people can finally spend their money on something useful instead of making it to make 'guilds' for items so they can become powerful and essentially kill people 'as a guild' but without the money incentive.Idea reported by Rubicante Sun Oct 27 16:36:21 2002/d/shadow/rooms/palace21: bounty system. we can place bounties on people andthere is a list made of people and the bounties on them. It is all anonymous sono-one knows who placed the bounty (not even the assassin). When you place thebounty you deposit your money and when the person is killed the money transfersto themI LOVE this ideaIdea reported by Azire Mon Oct 28 20:25:10 2002/d/tirun/square: with the new fly system.. you could have random encounterswith ROCS, and other airborne foes..Ahem..Idea reported by Daboura Mon Nov 11 11:41:48 2002/d/shadow/rooms/palace17: party I thought it would be cool if parties had atimer on them so you could see how long you have been partied. then you couldcompare more closely who you really xp faster with in grpsIdea reported by Blits Mon Mar 22 06:38:35 2004/d/freepk/rhondale/rooms/zforest/x5y22: Faeries should be able to fly."
