__Letter "Woooooot! :D I'm now level 60. Haven't maxed skills yet, but hopefully I can gradually get that done over the long weekend :)Oh I partied with Tsuke for about 10 mins today, too. Twas nice, we went to Rhondale and he holyfired and I raged and it was all good--though by myself I still think I might have too much trouble with it. Oh I partied with Tsuke for about 10 mins today, too.

So yeah, just interesting. I'm thinking I might pk tsuke for Jon, since I can do it in law zones..But yeah that's about it. :) *huggles*Byesexual ;)l."
