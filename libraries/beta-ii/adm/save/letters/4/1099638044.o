__Letter "Because there is no proof on either side of this PK I am choosing to warn you both that you will go your seperate ways and not bother each other again. The harass log is the only way to report harassment from another player. The staff will not punish anyone based on the word of another player because there is no proof. If you do not go your seperate ways, the offending party will be arrested or even deleted depending on the severity of the offender. Stormy.Stormy"
