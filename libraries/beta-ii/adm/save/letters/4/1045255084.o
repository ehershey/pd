__Letter "Hey. I'd like to be in charge of balance on the mud. I could take care of spells/abilities and in some cases mobs and weaponry and armour. I know the mud in and out (i've had 10 elite chars now and know each subclass well). My coding ability is somewhat limited but i have seen the format for spells and abilities in code and can easily ajust them for balance. My time is too limited to be a full time player anymore with my upcoming wedding, but i still get a few hours a day in which i could work on balance and such. Lemme know if this would be alright with you. thx for all your work.PS - Hermes really wants a possition from what he's been saying to me. He seems to really care about the mud and if he codes spells and what not i can balance them out nicely if you choose to put them in."
