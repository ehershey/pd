__Letter "Well, I was just caught off guard...  I asked my mom if it'd be ok if I stopped by, and she was fine with it.  The only convincing I had to do was that it only takes 10 hours to drive from here to MN....   not that I'm complaining, mind you.  Hope your trip back up to mayuki's is good and that you all have a good time there.  I'll talk to ya when you get back.  *hugs*                          -Paul"
