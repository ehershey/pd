__Letter "Just to let ya know, a lvl 50 pyromancer's shroud spell does 1.7k hp damage to me, im a lvl 50 rogue with high 30's in int and wis. Since it is a leet attack it should be chopped to near uselessness, and rathe and kymas think a random range of 750 to 900 would be fair to them, but I know its up to you.And while you are balancing, can you take a look at circle and backstab? Im doind 1080 hp damage to rathe(the lvl 50 pyro) and thats pretty universal when I arena someone. my circle does 416 and my quad stab does 420 hp damage to ppl, just lettin ya knowThanks for all your hard work stormie!!!!!"
