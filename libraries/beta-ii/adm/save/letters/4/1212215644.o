__Letter "Hi,I've been going through a lot of things as you know and the emotionsare hitting a high.  I want Josh to know what he did tome and how hetreated me.  I want him to know just how much pain he has caused meand tonight, I was sitting here and got really upset over it.I know it's a lot to ask, but could you please tell him what he did to meand how mean he was to me, so that I can put it behind me?  Every time I'm in a room and he shows up, I can't help it.  I get reallyannoyed.  I was playing on here and levelled, so I was trying.Please tell him somehow what he did to me and how much he hurt meby what he did to me.He just moved on without any feelings.I'll be on one of our secret ones maybe later."
