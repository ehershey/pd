__Letter "Well, giving a large amount of exp means you can't give statsor other things as well. If you want it to give less exp, do this:set_exp(2000000);That will make it give 1mil exp when killed. You have to set itto double the actual amount (that's some Decartes-logic).I would think +2str/con/cha would be good, but it's up to you."
