__Letter "/std/obj/iron_senses.cThis is the file that holds the information in the objects for thesenses system i designed./std/IRON_OBJ_CHAINThis directory holds the altered mudlib files that allow my systemto operate. Main changes are removing the senses from room.c andthe cmd_read from the Object.c file. The reason for the whole mockdirectory is the chain of inheritance that takes place from theObject.c on down./wizards/ironman/experimental_room.cThis is a room that inherits the mock version of ROOM. Go into thisroom to experiment with the new system. I does not have the old systemfrom the stock room.c to interfere.All you have to do is inherit any of the objects from the directoryabove to have the functions to store sensory info on the objects :)/cmds/iron_sensesThis directory holds the actual commands. Add this search path toyourself to have to commands open to you.Ironman"
