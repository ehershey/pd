__Letter "I'm sorry for bothering you with this, but I am NOT ok with guild leaders having access to the guilds folders on builders.  Cenn said he wanted it to change everything, when I use those as backups.  Plus, if he's changing everything, it's easier for him to do it in his own folder.  I was not pleased to find that Ironman was ready to just do it, as it is a guild related issue more than a builder issue.  I don't know what you think about it, but I'm firm in thinking they should not be allowed guild access on builders, and I am not happy that Ironman thinks he can promise them anything guild related."
