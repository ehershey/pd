__Letter "A subhall in Helgrath. A subhall in Tirun. Main Hall (The Tower) out in the middle the ocean. The Tower does not link to any land, it exists on it's own little 'island' unless you think there should be a beach there so it can be sailed to.By island I don't mean something like Merkkerri, I mean something like that place with the coconuts. Imagine it like this: As you are sailing up closer all you can see is the tower, and a small beach in front of it to land on.The north exit from entrance.c could have been a beach to land on to get into the Tower by boat - A possible entry requirement for the guild. But I don't know how to make a landing zone, and it isn't vital since we aren't going to be sailing there. It was just a cool thing to add.If it takes 5 minutes to make a 2x3 area on the ocean with a landing zone, then that would be cool otherwise, it does matter where the tower goes, because nothing links to it.All the descriptions are up to date. With balance changes done it just needs to be copied into the game port.Sorry if the mail isn't polite or anything, got dragged around doing jobs today. %^CYAN%^*** %^BOLD%^WHITE%^Prator %^RESET%^CYAN%^***"
