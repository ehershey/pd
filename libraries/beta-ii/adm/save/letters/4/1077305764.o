__Letter "actually, they are within context of the game. they're one of my guild items, it actually works properly if i buy it for example like this: buy 200 dew, but if i do #200 buy dew (so it gives me one vial of each, one use left, as opposed to the normal 1 vial, 10uses) that's when it doesn't work.anyway, yes it is in context, if you read the description, you'll see that by mountain dew, i mean dew from the mountain, not the soda. i don't see how mountain dew or any type of dew is out of context. why not take a look at some of the other things \"out of context\", a quik-e-mart? i realize wiz wrote this, but it sells nachos and squishies. then you have a place that sells french fries and bloody maries. then you have azire giving out plushies (which is a recent invention)...etc, etc...i mean the whole valentine thing shouldn't even have been celebrated in that case, because the reason we celebrate it is for religious purposes, to honour the memory of saint valentine, who died in 256AD (around there), and I'm safe to assume that this game is FANTASY...so basically, this rule has been bent quite a bit..I made sure that everything I wrote stayed within the fantastical boundaries, SPECIFICALLY to please you. The mountain dew description, actually says that it's dew from the mountain, so (by your standard) it's \"okay\". Then I wrote magic beans, which are overly 'fantasy-themed', and I did all this for YOUR sake, and no one else. I didn't want you to feel that we were taking anything out of the game's normal context, and every time anyone has come to me asking me to write items for the guild or otherwise, they always want something that won't fit PD's theme, and I always give them the lecture (heh) on why that isn't okay, and try to give them ideas on how to keep it within the boundaries.Happy late valentine's day.-Jen"
