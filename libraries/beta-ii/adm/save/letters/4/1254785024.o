__Letter "Fireball is a lower level spell than shadowburst, at least currently.Gore is also a little underpowered, though the demons are worthless exp than the wizards you referenced. Of course, you can justnot attack the wizards.I think it's good to have some harder things around, it gives achallenge to those who want it."
