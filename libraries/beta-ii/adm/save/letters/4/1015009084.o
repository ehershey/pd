__Letter "Ok here it is, it should turn out alright:What is now known as the Illuminati was once one of the most feared of the evil guilds. However, several years ago they abruptly disappeared, and the black tower that served as their guild hall was blanketed with destructive wards. Recently, the holy magi have found that the wards surrounding the tower have now been lifted, and that the gates bear a plaque upon them that reads:Those of the past are destroyed,We are the present,We are the future,We are forever,We are the Illuminati. - Know that we are the hand of the light, and that we shall bring justice to these lands.(end)Ok thankyou buh-bye - Asha'Man Aziraphale of the Illuminati [heheh]"
