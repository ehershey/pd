__Letter "Hey love, this is the convo between me and Cyan. Hope u enjoy!!!Cyan replies: niceCyan replies: I love shit like thatCyan replies: I have a crazy theory on how circular and ever lasting theuniverse and dimenions really could beYou reply to Cyan: hehe, cool. :) hard teacher tho. She wants you to spit backexactly what she says. And in the right quantity for maximum gradesYou reply to Cyan: oooh, lets hear it. :)Cyan replies: well, the universal sign and figure of damn near everything.. isa circleCyan replies: even if it's not an exact circle, its still circularCyan replies: from planets, to planet's revolution around things, magneticfields even make perfect half circles on each side of the object, the atom.. weeven call this existance the circle of lifeYou reply to Cyan: bring it home, Simba!Cyan replies: so, then think of this.. an atom is a circle, with smallparticles of energy spinning around the nucleus.. perhaps not in a perfectcircle, but they have patterns.. rotationsCyan replies: lol! :PYou reply to Cyan: ellipses, maybe? :)Cyan replies: if you wish technical terms, yesCyan replies: sorry, Im used to describing it to stoned people.. lolYou reply to Cyan: planets move in ellipsesCyan replies: it is circular thoughYou reply to Cyan: this sounds like a more detailed and specific version of oneof my philosophies.Cyan replies: changes a bit.. maybe being pulled in, going awayCyan replies: I say the universe in dimenions never endYou reply to Cyan: my philosophy is this: everything is like everything.Cyan replies: I believe in thatCyan replies: and.. I believe, how do we know our universe isn't just an atomreply that's why Jesus talked so much in analogyYou reply to Cyan: that's why Jesus talked so much in analogyCyan replies: how do we know each atom, isn't a universeCyan replies: they tend to believe now, that in the center of our universe, isa super black hole.. spinning everythingCyan replies: nucleus, perhaps?You reply to Cyan: we cant, of course. Our knowledge of reality is limited bythe tools we use to analyze them.Cyan replies: maybe why, we get such tremendous energy of power from splittingan atomCyan replies: ofcourse.. but when you make comparisons, its hard to truly say Icould be wrong, or rightCyan replies: but in that fluctuation of possibility, I am a believer in mytheoryCyan replies: does it not make sense?You reply to Cyan: it does. the question I would put forth next is what do youbelieve from a spiritual standpoint then?Cyan replies: that is a never ending chain..Cyan replies: buyt even something never ending, has tgo have a beginning, acreation.. or creatorCyan replies: trust me, Ive put that in perspective of my theory as wellCyan replies: this long chain.. of never ending big to smallCyan replies: could even be.. the blueprint, of a greater being.. or it's dnaif you willYou reply to Cyan: ooooCyan replies: which Dna, also rotates.. and has circular makeup of the T's andsuch if you willCyan replies: see what I mean?You reply to Cyan: so this whole universe could just be a strand of dna, eh? :)Cyan replies: this whole universe, could be a T or I in a strand of DNACyan replies: we have no clueYou reply to Cyan: and with dna, only 1% or so makes us different from eachotherCyan replies: exactly, ade us within HIS likenessYou reply to Cyan: so that tiny bit of spark could be Earth and possibly heavenor hell if those were to be includedCyan replies: it doesn't say splitting image of him, but in his likenessYou reply to Cyan: there are many ways we can be 'like' somethingCyan replies: ofcourse, we are like most land walkers.. merely because theybreathe airCyan replies: but that is my point exactly in us believing God is a huge manCyan replies: but that is my point exactly in us believing God is a huge manwith white hair and white robesYou reply to Cyan: at times, I am like a jar, catching ideas, allowing them toblend with each other. at times, I am like a filter holding onto what I feel isworthwhile but a jar is not like a filterCyan replies: a jar with a filter lid? lolYou reply to Cyan: that is what is comfortable to us.Cyan replies: the reason JEsus as a white haired blue eyed man is comfortableto usYou reply to Cyan: we seek the comfortable. We wouldnt wanna think that Godlooked more like a dolphin than usCyan replies: but only looking at what is comfortable to us, is the reason KingJames ommitted so much from that version of the bible in the first placeYou reply to Cyan: well, it is his common depiction tho must people of Jewishdescent are not soCyan replies: he was dark skinned..You reply to Cyan: yupCyan replies: there is no way to be born in Jeruselum by a Jewish women.. andbe paleCyan replies: lolYou reply to Cyan: lolYou reply to Cyan: not at those timesCyan replies: but I have no qualms over it truly..You reply to Cyan: it is unimportantCyan replies: because, if he was green.. it didn't change what he didCyan replies: exactlyYou reply to Cyan: the minutiae is there to trip us upYou reply to Cyan: we have to step back and look at the big picture thenYou reply to Cyan: but we dont gaze at it too long or we can lose perspectiveCyan replies: dude, in the bible itself.. it kinda skips around the idea that..it's not a manuscriptYou reply to Cyan: so we go in our circles. :)Cyan replies: lol, more circlesCyan replies: but yeah.. the bible in my eyes.. is like a \"religion ofrdummies\" to get you started on something greaterYou reply to Cyan: the gospels are very circular...each starting and ending inroughly the same spots....same highlights more or lessCyan replies: if they were alll so set in stone, why would he make a seperatelist.. of actual lawsCyan replies: see? why would everything be so uniformly circular.. if thatshape didn't have so much meaning to itYou reply to Cyan: I see what you mean. But then, circles...could be minutiae.:)Cyan replies: hell, our greatest invention of all time, besides fire.. wasnothing but a stone cut into circleCyan replies: ahh.. very trueCyan replies: but I would only argue.. as to the higher step of the circleCyan replies: and say sphericalYou reply to Cyan: fastest way to travel somewhere directly is with a circularpath by flightYou reply to Cyan: allowing for curvature of the earthCyan replies: on earth, yes.. lolCyan replies: they say straight line.. but you can't truly travel on earth inastraight lineYou reply to Cyan: circles can set ya straight. :)  Cyan replies: not three dimensionallyCyan replies: lol!Cyan replies: hell, even centrifugal force.. the way you keep water in thebottom of a bucket when you spin it over your headCyan replies: is only possible because you spin it in a circleCyan replies: if you were to swing it back and forth with the same force, you'dbe wetYou reply to Cyan: imagine if the buildings we built were huge semicirclesinstead of trying to make tall phallic towers. how much secure could eachbuilding be? more impervious to weather and such?You reply to Cyan: true Cyan replies: so much more, they would probably never have to rebuild themCyan replies: besides earthquakes.. I thinkCyan replies: aerodynamics would be insanely greatCyan replies: but.. they don't care about that.. they care about quick easy fixof more spaceYou reply to Cyan: the hurricane rips off the house, which does not conform tothe landscape yet spares the blade of grassCyan replies: it lays against the curvature of the earth, like you said.. lolYou reply to Cyan: ennh. :)You reply to Cyan: you have a very interesting mind there, pally. :)who+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+( Primal Darkness )=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=[Admin ] Nulvect                                       Parity Avatar[Immrtl] Amun Argo Navis                               Omada Archon [Player] Cyan                                          Archangel  Fighter      [Player] Rommel the novice antipaladin                 Centaur    Fighter      [Player] Cenn the novice thief                         Illithid   Clergy       [Player] Ki the novice berserker                       Giant      Fighter      =+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=Cyan replies: woot, lolCyan replies: same to my zerkerYou reply to Cyan: ba dum bump!Cyan replies: only other person ever to get my theory, and expand on it.. likewe just did.. is my own fatherYou reply to Cyan: smart man. :)You reply to Cyan: takes an open enough mind. :)Cyan replies: yes.. my mother calls me a heretic for even speaking about it..lolYou reply to Cyan: plus if I believe that everything is like everything, I'mhalfway home. :)Cyan replies: lolCyan replies: maybe why they have the saying, \"home is where the heart is\"?You reply to Cyan: funny thing is God tells us we cant fathom his methods. thatkinda means anything goes, literally ANYTHING.Cyan replies: EXACTLY\\Cyan replies: gah, I wish you would sit next to me when me and her have debatesYou reply to Cyan: well, home isnt a physical lpace...home implies connectionsYou reply to Cyan: could do that on msn sometime. :)Cyan replies: eh, she's stubbornYou reply to Cyan: and anywhere sufficient connections exist could be homeCyan replies: she'd turn off the compYou reply to Cyan: lolYou reply to Cyan: that's why someone like that you have to babystep them tothe truthYou reply to Cyan: no big leapsCyan replies: which means though.. if you can find connections, how differentcan it possibly be?You reply to Cyan: yep Cyan replies: no dude.. she is a set in stone non conformistYou reply to Cyan: you build it up with little Legos  Cyan replies: she still argues with me that dinos didn't existCyan replies: because it didn't say in the bible in wordsCyan replies: I want to hit her with a fossilYou reply to Cyan: that's the thing...God made the beasts that crawl upon theearth before he made usYou reply to Cyan: and a day to God can be an eternity in itselfCyan replies: exactly, I even tried to show her a jokeCyan replies: it said a man was talking to god.. and asked him.. whats a minuteto you?Cyan replies: god said.. a billion years..Cyan replies: then he asked.. ok, whats a billion dollars to you?You reply to Cyan: George Bush sells us fossil fuels and gets rich. :) u meanthere werent dinosaurs? :)Cyan replies: God replied.. a pennyCyan replies: lolYou reply to Cyan: hehe, I know this jokeCyan replies: dude, Ive tried that approachCyan replies: lol, the.. \"in a minute?You reply to Cyan: God, can I have a penny?
