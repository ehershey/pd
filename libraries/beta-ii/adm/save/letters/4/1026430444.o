__Letter "Well, to say the least, it might have been leaked or too many people know about it. I just had a player ask me if there was a way to limit information to the questor so that if they move something in the room it only shows to the person who moved it stuff like that.I also had an idea for the dragon quest that would limit the availabilty of the access by putting a random on the exit to the doctor with the vials. or make the vials appear with a random number like we did with the diamonds in merk. That would severly limit the amount of people logging on to do the dragon quest after it would be put in. The last time I was here for a reboot, there were 9 newbies lined up for it so I think a limiting factor on whether or not you die and go to the quest area would be a good idea.Just my 20 bucks worth lol. if you have any questions, ask away.                       -=Wraith=-"
