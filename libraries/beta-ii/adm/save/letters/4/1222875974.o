__Letter "Lemme try to encapsulate this so as to be thorough yet brief.Rohl had issues with Freddie who joined DS. Rohl tried to bullyhim away from Rhondale. Freddie sat in ambush for him and it allgot worse from there. Rohl and Aethion try to kill Freddie havingAethion get the last hit so there's no outlaw tag. Freddie bansme from buffing Rohl and Aethion. Rohl sees me flying to Rhonto meet Freddie and give him buffs. He thinks we will dbl teamhim like his punk butt tried to do to Freddie. He stops talkingto me. I explain situation and recommend peace talks. Rohl agreesand says he will make Aethion agree. I tell him I dunno boutFreddie. Rohl gets mad that Freddie doesn't come around fast enoughand then really mad because I still won't buff him. Then I catch areply to someone else saying 'f**k him and f**k uzi, i'll kill themboth'. This pisses me off so I throw it on the mature line andthen in my chfn, nominating Perel (char he was on when he said it)for Mistell of the Year. Jump ahead, he kinda apologizes and Iforgive him but I didnt change my info. I was still upset. He isxping in s3 and dies and Freddie gets all Perel's gear. Really, just some crap and three diamonds. Rohl throws hissy fit, Freddieeggs him on and Rohl suicides. We believe he came back last night as Vathom tho.Btw, wis is up to 202. :) Catch meee!Uza"
