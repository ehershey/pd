__Letter "Ya never mailed or said anything about the system since ifinished it Stormy. I was wondering if you have looked at it.I showed it to NUlvect and he said he liked it. Wanted to knowif and/or when its gonna be implemented. I wanna alter theTirun Reef area to use the new system. I therefore will wantthe system in place on builders with any changes that you wouldwant done to it. Please mail back to me with your plans. Ifyou havent set plans for it at least mail me and let me knowthat :PI'm very eager to get this sensory system into the hands of thebuilders. I think i can draw in alot of builders for you onceit's in place. More builders >> more areas >> more players.Also i need to get that copy of the mudlib placed into thedirectory /std_current when you have time. Dont worry aboutmodifying it. Ill handle the upgrades for the builders port.I just need a straight copy of the current mudlib. If youwant to make it simple, you can do it after the sensorysystem is in place.Just let me know whats going on ??Ironman"
