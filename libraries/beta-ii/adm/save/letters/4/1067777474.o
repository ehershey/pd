__Letter "Yeah, she got bugged.Once she rescued the girl she couldn't get out of it. The whole sequence went by, but the paralyze didn't end. So she is totally stuck.Then she went ld to try and get out of it somehow, and now she gets spammed by the little girl saying \"What are you doing, you have already complteted the quest, go back from whence you came.\".It's rather annoying you can imagine."
