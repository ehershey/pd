__Letter "*sigh* well, things went alright tonight, i'm EXHAUSTED .. but hey, the horses were gentle with me. i think they knew i wasn't feeling good. :P on the way home, though, i got nicked by a drunk 16 year old kid who was driving recklessly. the car is fine, i'm fine.. the kid is in big shit. *smirk* it was freaky anyway. It was a cold but beautiful night up here, lots of deer out and about.. my sister is in town for awhile, so i may not be able to get online until later at night for a little bit. and remember.. on Wed. i'm going to be gone for about a week. i miss you.. thanks for the rose."
