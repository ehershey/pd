__Letter "Ok, I finished it. There shouldn't be any errors in it. Although you might wanna read it any make sure.  Player Killing-                         The new system                       By: Mochaprincess                 	As mamy players know player killing was put on hold in early October of 2002. Not very good news for some, but for others it was good. That meant that they wouldn't be constantly being killed, as for the rest it meant they couldn't kill others for awhile.        Many players who were effected by this, particulary thosewho could no longer kill others did not take the time to find outthe reason it was banned. In conversation with Nightshade I found outabout the player killing hold. I am not allowed to reveal why itwas put on hold, but I can say that when the player killing systemis opened again it will be basically the same except for a few changes.	There will be a new contient specifically open for pk (player-killing). It will also be used as a sort of prison area for those ofyou (no names) who constantly kill others. It will be similar to Tirunwith oil and stone shops, also with the nessessary halls. I'm not sureof everything that will be there, but as of now that is what I know.This also includes stealing and killing guards/peacekeepers. So those of you who kill them for fun unless you want to be banished to thenew continent I would advise you to stop. Also, for those few peoplewho like to steal 24/7 I would also advise you not to do that on a regular basis.	I would advise that anyone who does not wish to be freely pked,to stay off of the continent. I can think of a few people who I knowshould stay away from it, unless they just want to be pked. You willalso still be able to pk in Tirun, but not freely. So don't think thatyou're totally free from getting pked.                     Player opinions on the pk hold-  As always the players of Primal Darkness have there opinion on theplayer killing hold. Some them find it a better thing such asEndbringer who said, \"It's peacefull, I like there being no pk.There were also those who don't like it, such as Seth, who simplystated, \"It's crap. I like the old system.\" As always there were thosewho just didn't care like Joey, \"Ahh it's cool, just wait for pk toopen.Luv ya,Mocha"
