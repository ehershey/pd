__Letter "Please, do not try pk me, please don't try to pk me, please don't help someone pk, please don't para me and let a mob kill me.You have pk'd me twice (as a player, not character), and I saw your post on darksouls when I was an imm.Don't worry, I will not try to pk you. Both because I doubt I could do it, and because I would have no reason to. - AziraphaleOh yeah, since you have killed me twice, a third time I would consider harassing so just leave me alone please."
