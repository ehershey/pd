__Letter "i was wondering is it possible to get a death removed from my bio/score? it was an arena death bug against endbringer. he was testing backstab and i lost in the arena, he said it didn't add it to his kill list but it added a death to my bio. if you want to ask him its cool, he wouldn't kill me..we're tight..hehe..and in the same guild with my main alt..thanx"
