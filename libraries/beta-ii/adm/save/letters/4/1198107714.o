__Letter "Hey sweet lady, I just wanted to wish you a happy Wednesday because yes,even Wednesdays should be happy. :) Really, that was just an excuse to send you a mail. :) I was overjoyed at the prospect of talking to you so long yesterday. It was really cool. I hope everything is going wellwith your dad and family and I hope to talk to you soon. Take care, be safe, have fun and don't stress. :) Things often have a way of workingthemselves out. :)Love,James"
