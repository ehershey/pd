__Letter "ok I got a little more into it, i found some things i really like and I think you got a good ideaThe sp cost is a little high considering how many rooms there are, like I said it should still be much easier than walkingmaybe you could post a map in tirun, that doesnt show exactly how to fly everywhere but maybe at least the genereal direction and how far ya knowI know it's not finished so i dont need to go into detail about making it more colorful and interesting, and if ya want i can write some room descs myself, I made 2 100 room area's in another mud, all with descriptionsalso maybe a coast option, something like you can press coast east and you'll automatically fly about 20 rooms east or somethingand maybe anyone with the ability to fly can mark down two places they can remember really well, kinda like gate just make it take a while to fly there automaticallynewbie me too i ran outta sp every 5 secondslllol oops sorry i got a little sidetracked there hahayea but i guess thats it for now, maybe more landing spots too, 1 per zone kinda sucks"
