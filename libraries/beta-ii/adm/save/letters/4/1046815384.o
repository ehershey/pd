This is AT&T, may I speak to Mrs. Marino, please?>> ME:   May I ask who is calling?>> AT&T: This is AT&T.>> ME:   Ok, hold on.  At this point I put the phone down>       for a solid 5 minutes thinking that, surely, this>       person would have hung up the phone. I ate my>       salad. Much to my surprise, when I picked up the>       receiver, they were still waiting.>> ME:   Hello?>> AT&T: Is this Mrs. Marino?>> ME:             May I ask who is calling, please?>> AT&T:        Yes, this is AT&T...>> ME:             This is AT&T?>> AT&T:        Yes, this is AT&T...>> ME:             The phone company?>> AT&T:        Yes, ma'am.>> ME:             I thought you said this was AT&T.>> AT&T:        Yes, ma'am, we are a phone company.>> ME:             I already have a phone.>> AT&T:        We aren't selling phones today, Mrs. Marino.

Wow!!! That's>                   amazing!>> AT&T:        We think so!>> ME:             That's quite a sum of money!>> AT&T:        Yes, ma'am, it's amazing how it adds up.>> ME:             Ok, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or>                just one big one at the end of the year for the full>                  $52,560; and if you send an annual check, can I get>                  a cash advance?>> AT&T:        Excuse me?>> ME:             You know the 10 cents a minute.>> AT&T:        What are you talking about?>> ME:             You said you'd give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours>                    a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  That comes>                   to $144 per day, $1008 per week and $52,560 per>                   year.  I'm just interested in knowing how you will>                   be making payment.>> AT&T:        Oh, no, ma'am.  I didn't mean we'd be paying you.>              You pay us 10 cents a minute.>> ME:             Wait a minute, how do you figure that by saying>                  that you'll give me 10 cents a minute, that I'll>                  give YOU 10 cents a minute?  Is this some kind of>                  subliminal telemarketing scheme?  I've read about>                  things like this in the Enquirer, you know.>> AT&T:        No, ma'am, we are offering 10 cents a minute for...>> ME:             THERE YOU GO AGAIN!  Can I speak to a>                  supervisor please?>> AT&T:        Ma'am, I don't think that is necessary.>> ME:             I insist on speaking to a supervisor!>> AT&T:        Yes, Mrs. Marino.  Please hold. At this point, I begin>                   trying to finish my dinner.>> SUPERVISOR:  Mrs. Marino?>> ME:             Yeth?>> SUPERVISOR:  I understand you are not quite understanding>                          our 10 cents a minute program.>> ME:             Id thish Ath Teeth &Teeth?>> SUPERVISOR:  Yes, ma'am, it sure is.>> ME:             (I had to swallow before I choked on my food.  It>               was all I could do to suppress my laughter and I had>                  to be careful not to produce a snort.) No, actually,>                  I was just waiting for someone to get back to me so>                 that I could sign up for the plan.>> SUPERVISOR:  Ok, no problem, I'll transfer you back to the>                  person who was helping you.>> ME:             Thank you.  I was on hold once again and managed>               a few more mouthfuls.  I need to end this>                   conversation.  Suddenly, there was an aggravated>                  but polite voice at the other end of the phone.>> AT&T:        Hello, Mrs. Marino, I understand that you are>               interested in signing up for our plan?>> ME:             No, but I was wondering - do you have that \"Friends>                  and Family\" thing because I'm an only child and I'd>                  really like to have a little brother...>> AT&T:"
