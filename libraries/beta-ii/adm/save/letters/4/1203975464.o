__Letter "March is gonna start out kinda different here too. I plan to be inDayton Ohio visiting my friend, Sundar from march 5th-10th orsomething very close to it. So I may go thru some withdrawal. :) Ihope you take every possible avenue to relieve stress. Sleep isgood, WoW is good...anything that doesn't tense ya up. If I canmake any contributions to stress reduction, I'd be glad to do so.I have something in mind, but I won't say just yet. :) It shouldbe a surprise. :D Looks like you were about 3 minutes idle when Igot back to the computer. Now, I need sleep, heh. Funny how thingsgo sometime, huh? :) Well, be well, take care and check thatemail account of yours in the near future. Might be a surprise forya. :DLove,James"
