They fusedthe souls of past members with the shoulder blades of dragonscreating this black and white striped fearsome combination.__________________________________________________________________Ideally, this mask would be worn over the face and function justlike mage robes giving a small random rebate to hp/sp/mp. It wouldhave roughly the AC of a Merkirri battle mask or maybe a bit less.Anubis of the Dead should sell it for 6666 gold."
