__Letter "I hope your happy,with the way you made me feel,the way you hurt me like,no one else, ever could,it felt like my whole life,was just a joke,the way you made me feel worthless,and the pain you created inside,now i dont know what to do,caught up in this fight,theres nothing left,between me and you,even though i made mistakes,i didnt need to hear,about them, time and time againthe way you made me feel,everytime you spoke,had my mind in a frenzy,never knew what to think,or what to do, its all your fault,all because of you.someday i'll make it,and then you'll see,not the boy, but what i could be,no matter what i did, you'd never approve of me,now what else can i do but try,i'll end up making it in the end,the only way you'll hear my voice,is through my pen,i know from the beginning,you gave me life,but in so many ways,you took it away,now i dont know what to do, caught up in this fight,theres nothing left,between me and you,even though i made mistakes,i didnt need to hear,about them, time and time again"
