__Letter "I looked over your area, and I have a few suggestions for you.  It wont be too big of a problem this time, but you may want to start spacing out your code.  If you look at my room example #2, you'll see that everything within create() is indented a little, and in the reset() everything after the if() is indented further.  It makes code a whole lot easier to read, and if you have any problems with it, much easier to fix.  You can also space out the different items of set_items or set_exits.Another thing that will have to be fixed now is having header files.  Stormy has a tutorial on how they work and what they do on the coding webpage.  If you have any questions about them, let me know.  We need them because when we move your area to a new directory we only have to change the header file instead of modifying every file.  My only other comments are minor...  The agressive on your mobs are a little high for a newbie area.  Most newbies will have a charisma of 2-20.  If you have a good reason for having them that agressive, that's ok.  The other thing is the \"boss crab\"...  this is just a personal thing...  I guess the term \"boss\" sounds too videogame-ish, but that may be because I play too many video games.  Perhaps switch it with \"elder\" or \"ancient\".  If other people think it sounds ok I wont put up a fuss about it ;)All in all, your area is pretty good.  Your descriptions are unique and descriptive, and the area is laid out well.  There is a lot of potential for later expansion as well.  You've got more done the past 2 weeks than most starting coders get in 2 months.  Good job.  :)                               -Nightshade"
