__Letter "Hey, I'm not really one for rumours, but since my recent posts on the newbie board, I've been getting a lot of messages from people on PD on MSN or AIM telling me about all kinds of things a certain member of Illuminati has done in the past (not Helena). I don't really want to name names here, but I was curious about something.I was told that the \"person\" who wrote Rhondale, included a way that he was able to protect himself there using something he wrote into the area, and that it somehow caused him to gain 60mil exp an hour. I don't know if this is true or not, obviously, but I was wondering if you could look into that, because it does sound like something he'd do. I haven't noticed anything, and I think Rhondale is a great place to xp. But the people who have been messaging me seem to be really strung over on all this, so I igure I'll just talk to someone who probably knows for sure. :)Anyway, that's all! -Kumi"
