__Letter "Why would you get jealous?  :)  Well, anyway, I'm hoping to be on about 9 or 10 hours from when i send this message. I can't really be on on the weekends, unless it's late at night (which it will be). And I'll be on all day Monday (or most, anyway). I hope I can see you before then. If not, I can always wait.  :)  And no, I didn't take that the wrong way. Staying sexy,Savannah"
