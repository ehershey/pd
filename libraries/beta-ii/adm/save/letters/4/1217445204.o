__Letter "I've been playing kataan for a few days now and have a few problems with it. First is mana consumption.. I'm about to forget about vortex and just use dakzhul and skewer, because it costs like 600+ mp to vortex 4 mobs. Hellfire costs like 1500 mp to hit for mobs, demonfire is aight but not logical for using after the first round. So yeah I have 2800 mp, and if I didn't have mp regen it would be gone in a matter or probably 2-3 rooms. Ouch. Number 2. Help stats states that wisdom increases effectiveness of faith spells and I had a buff that gave me +60 wisdom today, and it didn't even phase my vortex or fear. I had 600 faith today and that helped vortex/fear a little bit, but not too significantly. So yeah I dont know what else to say other than please consider my kataan ideas posted on clergy board. I'm pretty close to becomming a fighter. "
