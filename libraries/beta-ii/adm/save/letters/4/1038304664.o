__Letter "Paul,You were a good friend once, i'm sorry i've destroy that, i won't bother you further. You use to be the one person i thought i could talk to.  I just started to feel i wasn't worth the time or effort, that you really didn't want to know.Anyway it's over now, you didn't even try to fight it, so i guess that proves something.  Have a nice life, i'm here if you ever need me but i doubt that you will, after the total bitch i've been.i really do care about you and i'm really hurtingI really didn't mean for what i said to on newbie to be taken as a verbal attack on Azire, she ran, you chase, it was a joke.Anyway i guess you haven't missed our friendship as much as i have and i deserve everything i've gotten.  i'm not good enough to be your friend.  Anyway you won't have to put up with my rants anymore, i've really done it this time.Anne"
