__Letter "The other day i committed my first pk when i breathed and a guy walked in and got killed in one hit. Since this was my pk i had no idea what the result was so i ended up losing 16 black diamonds while serving at jail and getting a murder offence on my record. I feel this is somewhat harsh since it was an accident and it was my first pk. I was wondering if i could have some of the black diamonds reimbursed and have the record thing removed. If you feel what has happened to me is satisfactory and will keep things the way they are, i am willing to accept that. Thanks"
