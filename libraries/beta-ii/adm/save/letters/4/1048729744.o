__Letter "You tell Hermes: Trans me to the [], if you have the time.Hermes replies: Just quit out.You reply to Hermes: Id rather not, I have quite a bit of things on meYou reply to Hermes: Thank you.Hermes replies: Do not question me again.You reply to Hermes: Do not take things out of my inventory without letting meknow again.Hermes replies: I'm an immortal, you're a player.  You can kiss my ass.You reply to Hermes: You are probationary, still.Hermes replies: No. I'm a full immortal now.Hermes replies: I appreciate you wanting to give the ring back to Wisp but Itook care of it already.You reply to Hermes: That does not mean you have free run to mess with anythingin a player's inventory without letting them know about it. The point of thisis that you did not tell me that you had done anything to my inventory.Hermes replies: If you have a problem with me then I urge you to go toStormbringer. In the meantime I don't owe you anything for setting thingsstraight with a unqiue item.You reply to Hermes: I know you dont owe me any thing, but you WILL tell me oranyother player if you dest or rearrange ANYTHING in their inventory.Hermes replies: No.  I won't if I don't feel like it.You reply to Hermes: Then you will be punishedHermes replies: Giving me absolutes is a good way to get on my bad side.You reply to Hermes: You are already on my bad side.It really pissed me off that he deleted something in my inventory and did not tell me about it, nor did he intend to tell me about doing so. I do not like your immortals messing with my inventory.I do understand that the item he deleted was a unique item, but that and the combination of him being immortal DOES NOT give him the right to NOT NOTIFY me about things he is doing with my character.Talk to me if needed."
