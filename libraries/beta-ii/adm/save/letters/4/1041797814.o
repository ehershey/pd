__Letter "i feel i owe an explanation to why i left, although right now i cannot think of any, no hard feelings to anyone in your guild, i hope i can continue to be friends with them all, i just did not feel like the guild was right for me, or that the second-in-command was treating anyone with proper respect, and no, do not take any other action in reply to this post in the guild, pretend like you never read it. because then the guild might go spiriling off into space and explode, to you and you guild, i offer my best wishes."
