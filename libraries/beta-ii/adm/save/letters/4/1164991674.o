__Letter "Whit/Stormbringer, I need to know why Nulvect is ignoring me. Youtwo are not on as much as him and some of the less serious ?? i canask of him. Please have him remove this. There is no point in an immignoring anybody, especially if they're a builder....I'll respect the decision either of you render in this matter justkeep me informed. I'm just trying to get builders in shape likeStormbringer asked me to.Ironman"
