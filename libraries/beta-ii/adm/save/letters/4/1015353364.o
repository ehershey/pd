__Letter "I'm sorry but now I'm complaining.  Staticshield is now also useless, what is going on here?  First I lose my best spell, which is ok I find something else, now I lose my ONLY good spell, staticshield.  It lasts LESS then buffer, which is bs for a specialized defense spell, and it does absolutely nothing for armour, nothing changed, it should armour me that's the frigging point of the spell.  Now I can't even xp in roston, let alone merkkiri, why am I losing all of my spells???"
