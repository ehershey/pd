__Letter "Hey. No special reason that you should add me to your guild. It is your guild after all. I'd just like to be a part of it. The people in there seem to be nice and easy going which appeals to me cause too many of the other guilds have overgrown egos. I dont notice too many scipio people on so if you wanted me as a council member i could handle day to day stuff for you and things like that. So basically no reason to add me other than i like your guild and think i'd be a good addition to it.Sorry i was idle when you asked"
