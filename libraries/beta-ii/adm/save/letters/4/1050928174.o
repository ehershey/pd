__Letter "All the path rooms done, they were easy.The 'lost' stuff is gonna be more difficult, since I didn't make the rooms a standard length and it's a hassle figuring out how to search and replace with ed. So I went and chopped it all up, I am going to make them again like the first time on builders, this time they will have a standard naming scheme, and I'll put them into more subfolders so when you use 'ls' the mud doesn't just stop halfway.I am just making up all my aliases for that now, it could take a few days to get it done since I actually work 5 days a week now.Ok, that's it for the moment.p"
