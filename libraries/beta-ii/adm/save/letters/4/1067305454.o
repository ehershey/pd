__Letter "its not that you're low on my priority list - i dont really have the resources to even HAVE a priority list. i'm in survival mode. This is why i can't commit to you as a girlfriend. This is why i've backed away time and time again - its shitty but i can't do anything but cope with the anxiety and school as it is for me now. *sigh* i understand that you wont be on for awhile. I hope that you can be happy.. "
