__Letter "Hey Love, I'm sorry I wasn't on today either, and it's alright if you want to do a spring sport, I'll try to handle it well :). I don't have that much time to make this message as long as yours because i have stuff to do too :( I got a new History teacher because the original teacher I had went on maternity leave (she's having a baby lol) and she's a total bitch. But yeah I can't wait to get to talk to you. Love you lots.Yours trulyJosh"
