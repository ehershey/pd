__Letter "I feel as a demon that our level 25 ability, gore may be a tad too strong. At level 52, my gore does approxamately equal and sometimes more than my level 50 ability circle. In addition to that, the demon ability massacre seems to do LESS than gore. not only is it a level 50 ability, but it takes hp/sp/mp to use. So i have gore which is a lower level ability, thats cheaper doing more than an ability i had to work harder to obtain, which seemingly does less. If you'd like me to further test this please mudmail me. Thank you for your time.OOC time! Hey mook, What happend to talking to me and making fun of everyone!
