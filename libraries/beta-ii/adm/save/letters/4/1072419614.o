__Letter "Item Name: Sash of Flame (all trippy colours i.e: red, yellow, bold red)Description: The sash flickers with an eternal flame, never burning the wearer. Faces of doomed souls seem to appear on the sash calling for help before being engulfed in flame again.If possible, can it have things like: No Drop, No Steal, Autoload for Crem only? No give etc??Thanks Daos and Merry Christmas"
