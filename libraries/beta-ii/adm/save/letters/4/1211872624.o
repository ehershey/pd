__Letter "I have a major project you can maybe help me with, something I andmany other people have wanted for a while:A new mail system.If you're up for it, here are the prereqs:Each player's mailbox and letters must be stored in a single file.It must be easy to create and manage folders, preferrably displayedwith a bit of ascii graphics.Mail groups need to likewise be easy to create and manage, and itshould be easy for staff to create/change mudwide groups.There must be a search function which can, at the least, search thesubject/body of all mails in a given folder for a certain string.It must have automatic filters. IE, auto-delete any mail from Someguy,or move all mail from Thatguy into the Special folder.It must be possible to view a subset of the letters in a given folder,on the fly, such as all mail from Someguy, or all mail in the last 5 days.There must be spam protection - as basic as a rate limit (1 mail send every15 seconds or so) is fine.Commands must work on a range of letters instead of just one at a time.If you change the letters used for each command (which I would encourage),you should have a setting which will enable all the old commands to workapproximately as they used to. Example: if you make a \"list\" command tolist all letters in the current folder, turning on this compatibilitysetting would make 'h' do the same thing.All settings need to be explained in plain english and easy to view and set.The mail command should not be tied into an object at all.Anyone under level 20 will be required to be in a post office to use it.You can just have it check if the room has set_property(\"post office\", 1);for this.You must also create a program to transfer all existing mail into the newmailboxes. This can be in LPC, or bash or perl or anything that a basiclinux install can run. Probably easier in LPC though.--Feel free to modify the existing mail client if you want, or just code itfrom scratch. Be mindful of disk reads/writes and keep it speedy.Let me know if you want to take this on.-Nulvect"
