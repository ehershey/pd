__Letter "An odd sort of emptiness fills this area of the caves.  There are a few rare and largely out of place stones littered around the ground, but nothing large enough to sit on.  Oddly enough, a light fills the room, although it's origin is unknown.  Nothing but the echos of footsteps can be heard, save a soft buzzing sound coming from ahead.Through every hidden crack, a shadow spins the illusion of company throughout this room.  A soft buzzing can be heard all around, but the source is unknown.  Some rocks seem to be caked in gold, but as the light from little white crystals embedded into the ground is blocked, the shimmer vanishes and plain stone remains.  A musky scent fills the room, perhaps a sign of battlelust ahead.The occasional drip of water falling from the ceiling echoes throughout this room.  With each drop, the scurrying of some sort of rodent from it's home under one rock to another can be heard.  Darkness plagues this room due to scarcity of the white crystals which illuminate the rest of the caves.  There appears to have been a lot of fighting here, as many rocks look as if they were thrown in battle.It appears as if many cave-ins have happened in this part of the cave.  Piles of rocks litter the ground, as if placed there for a reason.  At least two feet of rock covers all exits, as if they were completely covered, but the rocks moved.  Shadows dance behind the piles of rocks, swaying in a romantically deceptive motion.  There is a circle of rocks in the center of the room, surrounding charred wood, as if a fire pit had been here some time ago."
