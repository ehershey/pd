__Letter "Well, I've been doing some heavy snowboarding.  I went for the past two weekends.  Finally getting back to the level I was at before I had to skip last season for desert time.  Did a few medium jumps and tweaked my knee a little.  It's alright, but at first I thought I might've messed it up good.  I was gonna take Jazzy sledding today, but it's really gloomy, so I made a fire and the two of us are cuddling while she watches a cartoon so I can write ya.  How was your trip?  I'll see about AIM...can't remember what my acct name was...do you have it on there still?  I'll try brainstorming a bit and see if I can find ya.  *hugs and kisses*  I miss you.  I wanna be able to have a live conversation with you in the near future.  I miss that.  *sigh*  Not enough time in the day.  Have a good night.-Jesse"
