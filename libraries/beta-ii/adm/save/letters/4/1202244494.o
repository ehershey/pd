__Letter "Dear Shaylah, I know we haven't met but I have it on the bestauthority that you are someone I should like to come to know. Iam unsure as to what to be. As such, I wish to be just...anadventurer for now. Maybe you could adventure with me sometime?I think meeting you would really open my eyes to the possibilitiesthat exist for a guy like me. Hope to meet you soon.Sincerely,Maki,"
