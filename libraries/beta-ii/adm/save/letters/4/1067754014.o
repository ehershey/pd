__Letter "so, i was on builders, doo dee doo - pyro's on as Wildfire cloaked - and he's asking me what i do, etc. so i tell him over cre what i do.. etc. THEN i get a message that \"a woman leaps into your inventory\". its that post-up girl he had in his room. apparently he got it from Wraith's directory. I called NS that moment and he got onto builders, saw it - gave Pyro a talking to. I'm sorry to do this, but i can't stand that sort of harrassment. he's constantly jibing me on the mud - that, i can handle. The pornography stuff on Builders WAS TOO much to begin with, and this is very far across the line. what to do? "
