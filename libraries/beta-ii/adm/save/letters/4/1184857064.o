__Letter "This guy is my 5th-6th most important character behind Escobar, Uzamaki, Boco, Leeroy and possibly Sabado. The notion of recording his inventory never arose. If I end up getting nothing, I'll understand but naturally wouldnt be too happy. All I want are the pumpkins and the diamonds. I've been told it's a fool dream to imagine getting back the diamonds, but might as well be that fool.Thanks for considering my case here.Iksrtfo"
