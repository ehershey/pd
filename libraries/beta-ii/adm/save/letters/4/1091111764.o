__Letter "dear Azire,    i tell myself i'm not very good at making apologies, mainly because i usually fail to find the right words, so here it goes.It was extremely wrong of me to blame you in any way for what has happened to david, mainly because it was partly david's fault for thinking and hoping that things could be different. I don't mean that in a sarcastic way, i mean that really. No one should have to change anyone to love them more or less or simply just to love them, and I guess i Forgot that rule of mine (one of many) when spurring on david to keep hoping.I'm not trying to play the dramatic tragic friend here by saying its all my fault, because, well, it isn't All my fault. But its not All your fault either. I'm not going to say who's fault it is, because it really leads us to no-where. I'll know better next time than to care about who david is falling in love with and trying to help.Someone told me that david was lucky to have a friend like me, because I was being angry when he wasn't around to be angry for himself, and that I was sticking up for him, even when it wasn't appropriate. But I guess when I upset you by showing my feelings over what has happened to david, something has to give.What happens next is completely up to you. I still want to be your friend, but i cannot just Forget what has happened to david. I Am Happy for you and Daboura, and I didn't know that you had known him for two years prior as a friend. I guess both david and I were quick to make assumptions over how much we thought we knew you. You on the other hand have been totally straight headed about everything so far, and no one can really blame you for anything.I am always here for my friends, even if my friends aren't here for me or want me to be here for them. Its just a thing i do. I put everyone else before me. So, if you no longer wish to talk to me, thats fine, i accept that. But if you don't want to talk to me as much, then thats okay too. I will always be here though, as a friend.~Helena."
