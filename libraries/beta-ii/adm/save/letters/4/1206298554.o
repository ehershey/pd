__Letter "If you believe that I like everyone in Darksoul, everyone who'sever been in Darksoul or everyone who will be in Darksoul, youare sadly mistaken. It takes all kinds to make a guild, a team,a unit or even a family. I hoped you would've talked to meabout it before you acted. I mean, when we talked, it soundedlike we made an agreement and I could trust you to keep yourend. Now I was originally very mad. I said 'Rohl wants to runDS like his own little club. Maybe I should leave it to him.'But I'm not gonna do that. But I would prefer if you pleaseconsider that an action means more than we intend sometimes.I'll leave it at that for now.Esco"
