Ifanyone sees him causing trouble, bothering other people, etc.  feel free to logit and gag him.  The characters he will be using are bone and regret.  Thanksto everyone, and sorry about my previous lack of communication.                       -NightshadePS btw, he is not allowed to be a builder (in case he asks)=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+="
