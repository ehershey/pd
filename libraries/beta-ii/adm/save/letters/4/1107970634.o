__Letter "I had this idea about shimmer for making it the main antipaladin attack.  Since shimmer can actually fail and miss, could you make it so a successful shimmer can be followed by a demonbolt in the same round?Don't know how that effects balance but my demonbolt is pretty weak, so it seems like it'd be a cool technique.  Your shimmer opens the door for the demonbolt.Levi"
