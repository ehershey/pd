__Letter "Well, the thing is, we want a quest which is not easy to leak.Something which will change each time, automatically. It will takenot only a complicated area to put it in, but also a fair bit of full-oncoding knowledge. If you really want to learn past just building,I could try to teach you some, or you could ask Ironman if he can.However, before any coding would come the brainstorming - have tofigure out just _how_ to make it leak-proof... and you could helpwith that part without any coding knowledge."
