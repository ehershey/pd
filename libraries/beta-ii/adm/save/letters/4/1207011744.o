__Letter "Hi love, I want to apologize for not being on too much lately.  I know I toldyou I'd come back, but I keep getting told off because I'm on the computer,either wanting to try to work on my work or playing games.  It's like I'ma kid again.  Trevor is really worried about me and I told him I need to talkto my friends on here.  He is upset mainly because I keep falling asleepat the keyboard and he has to get me to go back to bed.I went to the doctor and then to the lab for tests.  He said I do havepneumonia, but he also was checking for iron levels.  He said I have torest more and stop worrying about things so much. I also confided in Jarrah about you a little more, but he told me that wehave to be concerned about getting me well again.  I tried to get backon last night, but Trevor needed my sister-in-law and my help.  When I washelping him, I got dizzy and he grabbed me.  He then scolded me fornot resting enough, he said it's his place to tell me what to do. LolThen this morning Jarrah came over and he said I was too pale and then Trevor and him got talking about me.  Jarrah gets upset about me and Trevor didn't want to worry him.  Jarrah feelsresponsible for me a lot of the time.  Then when my Dad called for me, Jarrah went and told him about it andthat I was going in for tests and then my Dad got concerned.I assured my Dad that I was resting and that Trevor was being a goodbrother.I told Jarrah that I liked you on this game and he told me that my firstpriority is getting well, because he doesn't want me in the hospital,because it would kill my Dad.I'm on antibiotics to help with this and then they will have the lab testsback later this week.  Trevor told me that I should be resting more, I told him I wanted to talk to you on here, but when you weren't on, Iwent on WoW.  He then said \"no more computer for you young lady\".But, I will be okay and I am truly sorry for not being on when I saidI would be.  After I was helping Trevor and got dizzy, he shut off thecomputer and I went to bed and fell right asleep.I'm trying to figure out a cellphone plan, but I just haven't been ableto this last while.  I guess I am feeling really badly for not beingon as much as I can.  I don't know what the problem is with themicrophone, I will have to call the company on it.I do miss you, and I am sorry.  :(Love,Rayna"
