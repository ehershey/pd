__Letter "Druss mailed some harassment crap and it came to me. Here's what happened.Pyro was all whinning about death and yakko says you got nothing to complain about cause he lost 120 mil in 2 days. Pyro keeps going on about it. Yakko says drop it. So pyro starts being a jerk to yakko. So I killed him. Pyro says on newbie that i should go fuck myself. Then he starts going off on yakko (stuff like whoever spams yakko the most will get 100k from yakko) and that sort of thing. I hear yakko killed him then after i logged off.Not harassment if you ask me. Well earned deaths-- Ash"
