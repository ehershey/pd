__Letter "How would the directories be here on the main port when im stilla mortal over here ?? ;)All the directories are on the builders port cause i have no accesson the main port to do anything over here. Even if i did, I woulddo my experiments on the builders port first before trying to intigratethem on the main port. I perfer to have something experimental isolatedfrom the main programs until we got any bugs worked out of it. Its thereason i made a mock version of the mudlib to do my testing on.Ironman"
