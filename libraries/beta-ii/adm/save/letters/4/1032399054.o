__Letter "It's not like i've never done that before, and why wouldn't i want to talk to youi'm just not copeing with stuff very well, i think it's just better if i stay away for a while.it's just not You and Az, it's just everything.  You used to be my rock, and i can't have you for my rock anymore.You'll always be special to me, and i've missed you heaps, but life must go on.  I hope everything works out well for you and i'll see you around sometime.Anne"
