You may not harass anyone. If they ask you to stop, just apologize   and be nice. This is supposed to be a fun experience. There is a harass   log. The punishment for harassment varies but is never taken lightly. 2. The Primal Darkness Staff is not allowed to help mortals in any way    unless it is to fix some kind of bug. Any player and or staff member    who breaks this rule will be instantly rid and banned for life. All of   the Staff are to be respected. DO NOT ask a Staff member information   that you know would be breaking the rules. 3. Although we try hard to make sure everything in the game works right,   sometimes the code has unforseen bugs. Exploiting bugs is not allowed.   Any who exploits bugs shall have all their characters deleted for    cheating. If you find a bug, use the bug command to report it and never   try to use the bug again. A bug may consist of but is not limited to:   gaining experience from doing nothing advancing skills, stats, or    levels without using exp or doing a quest fighting a mob that doesn't   fight back casting a spell on an object repeatedly to gain exp --More-- (17%)    selling an item over and over and it does not leave your inventory   buying an item at a shop for 0 money etc... 4. Player killing is allowed on Primal Darkness. There is a justice system   in play and it is always evolving. Multiple PKs of the same character is   harassment. Going on a PK spree is harassment. You must be level 20 before   you can pk or be pked. 5. It is illegal to give away any quest/mini quest information for any   reason. Quests may be done with another player, but both players must be   activly questing. You may not finish a quest, and the other person just   solves the end of it. The location of a subclass hall is mini quest info. 6. Multi-Playing is illegal. You may not be logged in with more than one   character at any given time. With the exception of immortals and test    characters. You may not log in with one character, to get weapons or   any other items for your alternates. You may not switch characters if    a friend needs anything from your alt. If you wish to help a friend out   in any way, you must log off for 5 minutes before loggin an alt on to    help out. You may not, at anytime, avenge a death with an alt. Any--More-- (34%)    violation of this rule will be met with character deletion. 7. Spamming lines, says, tells, shouts, boards, or any other form of    communication is not allowed. Spamming is repeating something over    and over to annoy others. Spamming is harassment. 8. The auction line: Do not continually bid on an item you have put up for    auction, if you put something up for auction, bid on it once for the minimum   price you wish to sell it for and do not bid on it again. Do not put   worthless items such as stones, oil, meat, or things of this nature   up for auction. Do not continually try to auction the same item over and   over. If no one bids on your item the first time around, you should wait at   least 10 minutes before putting that item up for auction again. 9. Profane language on open lines and boards is not allowed. Using it in    says, tells and on party lines is ok as long as it does not get out of    hand. If someone asks to stop using that language to them or around    them, please respect their wishes. If you repeatedly ignore someone    asking you to stop using the profanity around them, it becomes harassment. --More-- (51%) 10. Stealing kills is against the rules. If someone is killing a mob go find    another to kill. You can't join them, help them, take their kill while     they rest one room away, or loot the corpse when they are done unless     you are partied together. 11. Scripting while away from the keyboard is not allowed. If you are going    to play you must be at the keyboard while doing anything. If you are not    at your keyboard, your character should be idle. There are no exceptions    to this rule. Breaking this rule will lead to character deletion. 12. Please do not put down other muds here. Do not compare our mud to others    on the lines. We have worked hard and hope you enjoy it. No one here cares    if you think X mud is better or worse than this one. No one cares what you    did on another mud. This mud is for playing and having fun not bashing    other muds not bashing this mud not bashing other games players, admins,    etc. Let me explain one more time, DO NOT discuss other muds here.    Just have fun and follow the rules.  13. The delivery system: Using scripting, speed walk programs, gate, fly or     any other forms of quick movement is against the rules. Anyone breaking --More-- (68%)     this rule will have all money and experience removed. 14. Feeding is illegal. Feeding is when a player is in a party and does     nothing but still gets the experience. If you are in a party, you should    be helping in some way, this does not mean sitting in the square and    mhealing either. If you are healing for the party you should be with the    party in whatever room they are fighting in. Breaking this rule will     result in character deletion for everyone involved. 15. Character sharing is not allowed for reasons of character abuse by    multiple parties. If you are found to be sharing a character with any    other player, the shared character will be arrested and deleted. Any     players involved could be punished as well. 16. Using LAN's. If you are connecting from a LAN based computer with another    player, you will need to report it using apply. Help apply for more     information. If you are on a lan with other players and it is has not     been reported, it will be considered multiplaying. 17. All finger info, enter and exit messages, title, description, etc. shall--More-- (86%)     not contain lewd or offensive material. This includes, but is not limited    to, referances to illegal activities, racial remarks, lewd behavior, or     anything else the Staff deems should not be allowed. You will be told to    change any info only once and failure to do so will lead to punishment. 18. Stealthing your enter and exit messages with color or misleading     information is not allowed. An exit message should have a clear message    of which direction you leave in.   Note that ignorance of these rules is not an excuse nor a reason why you  should not be susceptible to the consequences. That means that either not  understanding why a certain rule exsists, what that rule means, or simply  not knowing that rule exsisted. The breaking of a rule will be punished,  regardless if you knew you were breaking a rule or not.  If there are any violations or other issues concerning these rules,  please contact an admin.> Autosaving.tell sugarcandy Just out of generousity, I'm letting you know that you're breaking rule 18.Sugarcandy is idle and may not have been paying attention.You tell Sugarcandy: Just out of generousity, I'm letting you know that you'rebreaking rule 18.> Altima <newbie> bbl bye<buddylist> Nightshade has left the realm.Altima <newbie> is there a way i can only see the inventory im carrying?Altima <newbie> bbllookYou feel at peace here.The Drowning Fish TavernThis is the south end of the bar.
