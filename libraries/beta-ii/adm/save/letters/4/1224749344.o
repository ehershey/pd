__Letter "Hi love! I am sorry I didn't mail you last night. I was soooocrazily busy. And then, Smokey was on and I started xping with himduring my lunch. :( I'm doing pretty good. Tonight, I have onlyhalf the responsibility as last night, heh. So, I can't complainwoo much. :) I hope you had a great day. My baseball team won thefirst game of the World Series tonight, so I am happy about that.And I started watching this documentary called Souvenir of Canada.I learned about the ookpik? and CBHC houses. I still have an hourleft in it, but before long, I should be able to have a better insightinto the Canadian psyche, hehe. Take care and I hope to see you soon.Love,Your James"
