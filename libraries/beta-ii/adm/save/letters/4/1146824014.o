__Letter "Stormbringer-Hello, I hope that you are well. The reason I am mudmailing you, is because as you are usually absent from this mud, or at least not talkative (but cloaked), you don't really know much about me. When you told me that you were going to get the admins and the imms to tell you about me, I thought, I should tell you a little bit about me as well. I know what some of the Admins/Imms think of me. They think my personality will clash with becoming an immortal. They think I complain too much or that I start fights etc etc. To be honest, yeah sometimes I complain about things...BUT that is after I have initally brought forth something such as harassment. When people are being harassed by others for months at a times, and harass logs are made etc etc, and nothing is done about it....yeah, I will say somthing, as that shows that the leaders of this mud are not doing their job. As far as my personality, I get along with almost every single person on this mud, and most of the players would tell you that themselves. If the players did not like me, they would not have made me their Tirun Mayor. And I know Daboura thinks I have attitude and all, but so does he, and yet he is an Admin.Sometimes I bitch, sometimes I moan, but does that not make me human? There has been a lot of drama going on with the Admins/Imms lately, which just so happens to be a reason you are here. That is probably because everyone looked to Daboura and Nesoo and Whit to do all the work in your absence. I know Azire doesn't like me, and I know she will give me a bad report to you because of this. When the fact of the matter is, everyone on this mud knows she does nothing for it, except idle and tell people to talk to daboura or nesoo. Personality is a fickle thing, I feel as if I would do a good job, Paul (Nightshade) feels I would do a good job, A LOT of players feel I would do a good job, and I know Daos feels I would do a good job. As this mud is about players, and helping them and making the mud a better place, I value what they say, and I hope you do too. All I ask, is that you take all factors into account before deciding. I could bring a lot to Primal Darkness, and not just new XP areas, but new ideas on spells, abilities, guilds, XP systems etc. as well as helping keep the law and making sure people follow them and get along. One thing I learned in studying Psychology is, people see what they want to see, and sometimes that leads to fabercations.Obviously, the decision is up to you, but that is a little about me. I hope that your day, and the days to come are fantastic and Thank you.Carina"
