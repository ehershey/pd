__Letter "I understand about the restriction now that ya explained why the accessto reboot it is guarded.Now that you told me what went wrong, I'll know what to watch for ifsomething needs to be modified again. Now that i know HOW it's sensitiveI can watch and make sure it WILL work. I didn't realize that the fileswent in the order of inherits.I just wanted the center.c to take into account the width that the userdefined for their screen and an optional width for use in making coloumneasier. Usually i don't mess with s-funs unless it is something i customwrote and added in myself... like security_screen.cIronman"
