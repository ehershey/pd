__Letter "Hello Whit, I am here to tell you about something that I did, but did not follow through on.  I was on my alt, Goldenberry and I gave money to another alt.  I have never done this before and I felt so bad doing it the first time I not only put it back where I got it from, but I am also writing you this mudmail.  I am not a cheater on this game and all my stats and levels are all because I worked hard and XPed to get them all.  I do not wish to be deleted nor have my character altered, I do not think what I did fit the crime.  However, I will accept the consequences to come.  I do my best to what is right, and I feel this letter is the right thing to do.  This was my frist time doing anything like this and I know it was wrong,which is why i put the money back right where i got it from; I did not use it, not even one bit.  I am sorry for having done it in the first place.  As far as what I think is a good punishment, I think I should have money taken away from both alts that were apart of it; I feel that that fits the crime, and because I did not even follow through, I dont think I should be severly punished.  But, the decision obviously lies in your hand.  I ask that you please talk with me in \"tells\" before doing anything, I would appresiate that.  Thank you"
