__Letter "Ok I have gotten the master.c to accept my tests for valid_read()and valid_write(). Now i have to adjust the BuildSecure.cI will be making a BuildSecure.bak of the original file in casethe changes make builders go wacky and i lose access. I don'tthink it will but sometimes a file that is used so extensivelycan have a cascading affect with unforseen consiquences.I will proceed with care and test my new version with eval andcall before i attempt the insertion.I'll update you with the results.Ironman"
