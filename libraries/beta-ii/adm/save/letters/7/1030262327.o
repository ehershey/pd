__Letter "*cries* Hermes killed me!!!....i hate holyfire or whatever it's called.Aldur got wiped out 2 times by Ashram, so we went to get him some armour, well we got the armour and left the room.  Hermes forgot we weren't in a party and decided he would kill the 2 guards at the door.  Of course i got hit by the shards then he holyfire and bang i was deaded.You know what the really wierd thing is, i'm not even really upset.I think Hermes feels pretty crappy tho, pretty much how i felt when i killed and nearly killed you, and not matter what i say he still feels crappy.  I think i'll tell that, i'm only getting my just rewards *chuckle*.Cya later*smooch*Wispypoo"
