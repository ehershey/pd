__Letter "Oh, I'm so sorry to hear you're not feeling well. :( You gettingbetter is the most important thing. Rest as much as you need. :)I will see you when I see you, simple as that. :) Bronchialstuff sucks. I have nothing but best wishes and prayers and lovefor you. And when you feel better, I'll tell you up close. :)All my love,James"
