__Letter "After confering with Daos, Cortoth and RUll; I have developed anew reviewing process geared at moving areas along faster. The newsystem breaks the issues into stages and we focus on them one ata time. The stages are as follows;      1) Coding    --- Ironman      2) COntent   --- Cortoth      3) Overview  --- Daos      4) Balancing --- Rull      5) Admin final - One of you three.The details of the stages are posted on the wizard's board on builders."
