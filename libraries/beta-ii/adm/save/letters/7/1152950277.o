__Letter "thank you for even taking the time hun, i do appreciate it.  nesoo and dabs always told me to log it or else they would not help me...if i stood up for myself they refused to help me and then i just stopped...b/c they wouldnt quit and the admins wouldnt help unless i took it in the ass so to speak.  so thank you, for caring and thank you for actually being a good admin."
