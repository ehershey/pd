__Letter "sorry I didn't wake you but we went to movie marathons and watched all of them until like 6:00 am. As of now I haven't been asleep at all for 26:30 hours. And it was only barely 8 hours then anyway.Stormbringer hasn't been on for about 24 hours atm. I doubt he will get the area in until tomorrow night, which is the beginning of the week for himBut who knows? Maybe he will get some time later in the evening (for him) - He won't be on past 4pm though I think. - Prator"
