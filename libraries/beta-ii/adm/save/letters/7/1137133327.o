__Letter "I have a question regarding the pk rules yet once again, the latest post by levi mentions that one guild cant pk the same person in another guild in a five day period more than once, but unless i cant read (a possibility) I see nothing regarding one guild pking various members of the other guild in the help file or the edit. Now partially why i bring this up is Myself and my fellow guildmate Plague, were killed by the same person in a rival guild(Vyce) in a less than five day peroid. I would just like some clarity as to if this is allowed or frowned apon. Thank you for your time reading this and i apologize making this an issue but i am quite confused on the subject due to what has been told to me in the past.Endy."
