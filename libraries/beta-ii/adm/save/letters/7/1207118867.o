__Letter "Hey love, I played more hooky from class. :( Myra's pickuptook longer than anticipated and I needed to get some more sleep.I woke up a little when you logged on, but felt like I reallyneeded the sleep, so I missed you then. :( But! I dont feelguilty. :D I am feeling much better now knowing how you are.At work, it's not too bad. Driving around so I get to stop in onpeople and kill time. I will see you soon, I hope. I hope yousleep well because I know I will. :) Take care of my Rayna. :)Love,JamesP.S. - Warden Trevor knows best...mostly. :)"
