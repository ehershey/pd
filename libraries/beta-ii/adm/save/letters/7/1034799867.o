__Letter "Just so you know, I gfot a mail from Galdur asking you promoted to admin. I know you spoke with him about it on builders and frankly I frown upon this wsort of thing. I expect my staff to remain nice and easy going but be aloof and proffesional at the same time. Discussions af promotion with players is not my idea of a good thing. Players do not and will never control my staff, who I have on my staff, or anything else of this nature. I hire, fire, promote people as I see fit. I am the one who decides who does what and when. I am mailing Galdur right after this to tell him it is not his affair, not his buisness, and to butt out. I do not know if you started this but I am no finishing it. If you feel you should get a promotion you come talk to me.*note* I am not mad nor pissed, it is something I just do not appreciate.Stormy"
