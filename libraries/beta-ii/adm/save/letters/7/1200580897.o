__Letter "I'm looking for an update bro. I wanna know roughly when im goingto get the updated mudlib for builders so i can start intigratingit into the other port for Daos and I. I don't want to startwritting the lfun help files until i have the update in case somefunctions have invariably changed.I've also bounced the bag idea off nulvect and i'll be taking thatfeedback into the new designs. I'll tell you when i have the newprototype ready for show. I think you will like my new toy :)I also mailed him about the new PK system i had in mind. He toldme that he also was working on one so I'll abandon mine.==============================================================I have about six coders from the outside that i can bring in tohelp us build for here when were ready. I'm only waiting on thenew sensory system to be intigrated before i start them up andintroduce them to you. These are people that i know IRL and wecan trust. People who use the same labs as me.=============================================================Ironman"
