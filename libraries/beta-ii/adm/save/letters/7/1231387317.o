__Letter "hi, please don't worry about letting Uza know about me. It's honestlyokay with me.I guess I'm just trying to get over being dumped and losing my Dad withina couple of days of each other. I don't think the shock has worn off yet.I hold no ill feelings towards him.  I do miss him, but I don't know what todo about it.Hugs"
