__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Aziraphale to Aziraphale Fri Mar 12 14:59:49 2004:-----Wrong, I changed my title a day or so before I made that post. I could have made it more ambiguous, but I just have one question... If there isn't anything wrong with it then what is the big deal? It isn't like I gave them your net address, and you have shown that you don't have access to the PD server, so really, what is the deal? That I brought up info from when I was imm? It's not as big a revelation as you probably think.I cannot fathom where you may have possibly got it into your head that Jacie and I were doing this 'spy' thing together. She created a new character that she could exp with, and after chatting with members of Forsaken she just asked if she could join. There is no conspiracy or anything there.It may be your opinion that placing spies in other guilds is wrong, but you are probably the only person who thinks that. In the past Darksoul have had spies in Illuminati, one of them even gave out gates into our guild. A member of Forsaken has an alt in nearly every guild. Oh yeah, you might want to actually *read* <help rules> again. I made a thorough look and there is absolutely no mention of alts in guilds.However, it *is* against the rules to use a different player's character. Eios(RName: K____) logged on the character Boffa(RName: D___), and used Boffa to read the Illuminati line. So I was wondering what you think of that.Sorry to burst *your* bubble, but your info on the whole 'scripting' event is, well, a bit more than just a tad off. Drunk... no, I don't drink. Carefree? Well, I'd hate to have to be so guarded when I am around my friends. Bragging about a mere slap on the wrist? Tell me Kumi, how long does it take to make (600,000,000) six-hundred million experience? What I was 'bragging' about was the fact that I convinced Nightshade to give me back Aziraphale temporarily..You see, a couple of minutes after I got home, while I was scrolling through my log wondering what happened. I got disconnected as Nightshade dested Aziraphale. I made a new char to talk to him. He said he would consult other Admins and then see about giving Aziraphale back. I convinced him to let me keep Aziraphale temporarily, and then dest me later if that was their decision. So yeah, I may have bragged about persuading NS to let me keep playing for the time, but I didn't influence his decision to let me keep playing permenantly.Almost forgot, I had no 'bubble' there to burst. I honestly didn't see how you would have heard about it all, since I only told people in rl, and most of the people I know really hate you. In fact, since we are giving away nifty bits of info here, almost no-one in Illuminati wanted you in, and I've even asked a few guild members to not pk you since your comments defending Forsaken. I won't name names though because I am like, *so* trustworthy.Hey, my original post was mostly asking questions and pointing out that this situation has happened before without such fanfare.Not out to hurt anyone? Yeah I can *really* believe that now.Most of the people I know agree, your ending comments are pretty silly. It is very easy to write out this nice long spiel and then say 'well no point continuing', before allowing someone to retort."
