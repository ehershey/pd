__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Ironman to Ironman Wed Jul  4 09:10:25 2007:-----I reread your post on the builders port. You stated that i wouldbasically be outside the immortals and mortals in that post. Ifim understanding that statement correctly, I wouldn't have aproblem with that. I would however ask the following guildlinesbe in place for the quests,deeds and events i would design;    1) The events would be every 45 to 60 days. The 30 day limit       would be to restrictive to make high-quality events alone.       I like my quests and events to be challenging and decently       complex. I would ask for the time to make sure of their       quality.    2) Since this would be the quest immortal post, Let this post       oversee and regulate all quests and deeds. I'm sadistic with       security on quests. You just need to see how i designed the       protocals on the ones in my areas to see this. I would ask       to be able to slowly intigrate this kind of system into any       quests that grants an object for a prize. In other words,       a strong level 60 wouldn't be able to get the item and sell       it off anymore. Not under me as the quest immortal.    3) Balance of the prizes would mainly be on the quest immortal.       The reason for this is that the quest prize should reflect       the complexity of the quest at hand. I'd have no problem being       second guessed on them. That would be normal and expected.       The final values should be an agreement between the quest and       balance immortals. However, the balance immortal should walk       thru the quest and take it's difficulty into account when       determining the value of the prize.    4) The events would be announced 14 days in advance via a seperate       sign posted in the [] so all can see and be invited to the event.       This would give the player base ample time to plan ahead to be       there and notify others to be on-line at that time.    5) Prizes for events would be housed in their own directory. I ask       this so that they are easily spotted and located for future       events.The above issues are just an outline of how i would ask this post to berun if i was to do it. The following is a list of the protocals i wouldimpliment on all quest/event/deed objects;    1) The object would check the player's deeds/quests to see if the       quest for which the prize is awarded is present in their bio.    2) If the quest/deed is NOT in their bio, The object would       self-destruct. If a legitamate winner loses an object, It would       be up to the quest immortal IF the person is worthy of replacement.       personally, i would have standby quests ready for them to do to       show me their worth :P    3) Self-destructing items would log who caused them to blow. These       logs would be under the juristiction of the LAW and quest immortals.    4) Quests will require a series of steps to be performed in sequence.       I would NOT allow the player to jump to the end cause they know a       PART of the quest. My quests require you to do step #1 to #5 before       step #6 is even possible.I wouldn't have a problem with the job if the staff wants me. Please mailback about this outline if you like it and/or have any modifications for it.Ironman"
