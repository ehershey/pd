__Letter "Vampire QUest:The quest will be a multi-level quest that has 5 lvled stages: 20-25 lvl, 30-35 lvl, 40-45 lvl, 50-55 lvl and finally from 60-65.  	Some Sparatic over all notes:		You can not have previously died if you wish to become a vampire, I am thinking of this as maybe death from a mob...rather being PKed is different, if this can be done that is.	Mini Quests - By Level:20-25:	/d/nopk/standard/cemetary/coffin7		Items you get:  Fangs	steps:		1. PK someone and get a limb from them (this could also be given to them 		or gotten in the arena)				2. Go to the \"Pale-Skinned Man\" in the graveyard, which is on the way to 		the Kataan Hall		3. \"Place limb on petal\" - Will start your quest to becoming a vampire.			a. The player will then be put into a trance, and they will have 			a vision with riddled details of the next part of thier quest.						b. when they wake up from their trance, they will be left with 					little hp, and have 3 rounds to leave before the pale-skinned 					man attacks them..of course he is a push over, but you are left 				with little hp so it could be slightly scary.***notes: if you are NOT between levels 20 and 25, nothing will happen when you \"place limb on petal\".  There will be a level check."
