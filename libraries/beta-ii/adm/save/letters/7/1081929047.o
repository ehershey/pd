__Letter "hey david.was just wondering the details of that law change thingy you told me about at the start of the year. you know, not getting law charges due to  someone attacking you in a law zone and then you kill them?seems some players are taking advantage of the fact that their lower leveled characters can try to pk a higher char, get them a law death, and then they keep xping as they like.Cars"
