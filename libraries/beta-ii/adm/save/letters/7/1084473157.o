__Letter "I believe these abilites and skill changes will complete the Ranger subclass. (pleas excuse the grammar I tried :P)Skill changes:Remove the Murder skill -> We don't use it and it's just a waist having it there.Give us 6 Projectile Per level -> Rangers are hunters and basic hunter weapons are a bow and spear so it makes sense also projectile if i'm not incorrect is also in the code for the abililty shoot. The real big reason for this is that we're Rangers and using a bow and arrow is ment to be our big thing, but since Warriors get 6 on every weapon skill they have the best shoot in the game and it's to me just plain silly.Ability changes:Trap -> Right now it's completly useless because there are a few factors wether it hits or not, them being; Dumb Luck and High Perception. When they do hit it's for like 7 damage. Also i've noted that the chance of them hitting is like 5%. Prehaps if there where difference kind of traps like; Gas trap (poisons enemy), Cage Trap (keeps the enemy in the room, preventing them from running) and Damage Trap (can deal a decent amount of damage). To prevent the abuse of traps prehaps it could be made so that you can only make 1 untill you either 1. Dismantle it or 2. Someone runs into it.Make -> A good thing for RP and pure bordem. The clothes and items we make out of them are to be honest weak and dull. Spears have the lowest wc i've ever seen and the clothes we have are low in ac. Now these items we make don't autoload and I remember Nightshade saying once that it was because if they did everyone could get them and there would be no use for the skill. Currently there is no use for the skill since all the items suck. So if they could be upgraded and made useful we might be able to make the items and profit off them.Forage -> 2 things are messed up in this. It's bugged; sometimes when you enter say: forage mud, nothing at all happens, you press it again and it says you're busy. That needs to be fixed. Also when you forage for herbs you cannot choose the type of herb you wish to forage for and it's completly random making it very annoying and time consuming to get the right herbs. Prehaps if you made it so you could; forage herb <poison/healing/antidote>.Brew -> Only problem with this is that the healing teas we brew up heal like 20hp. Now a level 80+ Ranger with very high Nature healing for that much is just nonsense making it unused. All i'm asking for here is a healing tea upgrade, maybe Nature/2 == the heal amount.Shoot -> It does no damage...Abilities Needed:Camouflage -> Syntax: camouflage, Makes the Ranger invis. When camouflaged any movement will bring you out. Since we are fighters the chance of people being able to see us would depend on their Perception skill and Intelligence vs the Rangers Stealth and Nature.Ambush -> Syntax: ambush <oponent>, Once that is done the Ranger will sit in the room untill the oponent enters then he will strike at them with a powerful blow. If the Ranger is camouflaged while ambushing there could be a 5%-10% bonus since they're hidden and are able to strike them more effeciently.Fletch -> Syntax: fletch <poison/pain>, Gives us the ability to make arrows of poison or arrows that just do damage.Impale -> Currently warriors and Kataans only have this ability from what i'm aware of but I see that since Rangers can already create spears and are hunters this ability should be granted to them.  --Eios."
