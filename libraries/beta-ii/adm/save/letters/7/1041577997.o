__Letter "Hi there. Sorry to bother you but i have a quick question. At level 20, you're supposed to gain the ability to cloak, am i correct? Well for some reason, it says \"You cannot do that\" every time i try to cloak. Is there something I am doing wrong or is this a bug? Your help is greatly appreciated.Savannah"
