__Letter "My heart races at the passion we shared, consummating ourmarriage and love. I never knew that it could be so wonderful.My heart bursts with love for you. I know that the passionI have been holding inside me was for you alone, I was destinedto be yours only, as you were to be mine. I know you have hadhurt and pain before, but you will never feel that again.I will make you happy. I know that you opened my eyes to passion last night and tothe pleasures of the body and I want to please you in everyway I can. You are now my life and my heart swells withpride at being your life partner. I love you my Endy, I cherishyou. Forever yours and always, your Lady, wife and lover,Adila"
