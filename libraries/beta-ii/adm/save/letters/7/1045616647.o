__Letter "Heylo. Well i just hopped online to check and see if you were on real quick and you weren't. So i'm gonna check about every 15 mins or so while I'm writing me english paper to see if you're on. I'll give you the tour of the illuminati tower if i see you. If I don't see you tonight, you can ask prator or halo, or any of the anari players to give you a tour. (type \"members\" to see the members of illuminati and their ranks. ex: prator and halo are ranked tallest. Gabriel is ranked anari. I'm ranked Hero and you are ranked Mortal). They'll probably do a better job of giving the tour than i would anyway. But regardless, I hope to see you on tonight. If not, well see you tomorrow then. ;)Lol...I just realized a typo in that paragraph makes me sound Irish (\"while I'm writing me english paper\"). lol. Well anyway, gtg. Hope to see you soon. ;)Love,Heather"
