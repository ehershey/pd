__Letter "Just to let you know stormy, I suicide my alts once every few months. This isn't do to any subject nor do to anything about Levi. If you noticed, Faust was never suicided I asked Wraith to arrest him so that I could work out a personal issue with myself and wanderers. I have worked out those issues and asked wraith to release the arrest on him. Now I'm told by wraith that your the only one who can restore my character, Just clear me on something, if he's arrested, does that mean he's deleted? In my experience as an imm, it just meant he couldn't be logged in. Now what your choice is, is your choice, Daidoji was created for reading and posting idea's only while Faust was arrested. Now I heard through the grape vine that you feel my attitude in the posts were childish, is this true? Let me know, you know how I am and i thought by now you would have known. Grape vine = Wraith by the way if your wondering. Now if you change pvp death, you change it, I thought by now that you would have known me well enough that i would find a way and adapt. The suicide thing, it has nothing to do with anything levi said, and several of my alts are still here. I just needed some time to test out something with wanderers and i found it. I explained it to wraith on my idea about slash,cut and stab, i feel its a legit idea. Posting Ideas is not my thing, if i have a good idea, i tell someone about it, meaning nothing to me in general, but if thats how you feel about me thats cool. I won't post any oppinions again out of fear of being called childish since thats how you look at me. RayP.S. Know what, congrats, this is the first time in my life in a long time that i am actually hurt, not angry, nor mad....just hurt."
