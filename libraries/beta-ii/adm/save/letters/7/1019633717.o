__Letter "I've been missing you a bit lately, and stopped by before going to bed, but I dont see you on.  I've been real busy with exams lately.  Luckily, I only have one more, and that's tomorrow.  I'll try to catch you again later.  Just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you.  *hugs*         -Paul"
