__Letter "Greetings Paranoia.I too, must apologize for my inactivity as of late.  Circumstances have kept me from letting myself appear in PD and I am sore for want of time.However, the whispers were just that, whispers that I had placed.Part of the talent of being one of the Shadow, is that you can manipulate those thoughts and ideas that are percieved of you, to your ends.To my ends, I have done this.To allow for a complete and smooth extraction from the guild of Unholy, and entrance into Illuminati, without someone from Unholy feeling they want to hold a grudge, I left with the implication that it was to obtain information on our enemies.However, this was just to allow for extraction.  Unholy may be powerful of arm, but they are not as quick or talented of mind.  My devotion to Illuminati is complete, but you would be wise to whisper otherwise when other ears might percieve.  No one comes to someone that is known to be trusted...but when a person's trust is known to be...risque in regards to certain...alliegances, they are often approached with interesting propositions.  It is these propositions that I want to hear, so that I may know where they stem from, and further help to protect the guild from others.It is but a game to me, and I play it with Mastery.So whisper, in public but discreetly, that I may not be fully trustworthy, but know yourself, that I am as solid in my word as a rock, though I appear....but a Shadow.Beleqwaya the Shadow."
