__Letter "I know for many years people have been trying to get Archangelsand demons upgraded in some sort of way.Now ive talked to a few Angels/Demons, And they agree that statcosts to raise are too expensive compared to other races.For example, Faerie a non-quest race has the same dex/str/con costas an Archangel, And superior str/con to a Dragon.The race chain seems to go Faerie > Elf > Raknid (quad slash)> Dragon > Angel > DemonNow i dont know much about all the races, but i know thata lot of races are superiour to angels and demons and dragons3 quest races which are difficult to become, Or just not able to becomeI would like to suggest a stat cost lowering for Angels/Demons and dragonsAs they should be superior to all non-quest races in my opinion, Thats the wholepoint of going to elite to die and become one of these fabled races.If you could mail me back with your thoughts i would appreciate itbecause i know that this is a subject that has been going on PD for a longtime and well, Dont you believe that dragons should be superior, Dont you believethat Angels/Demons should be superiour?.As a demon Kataan, My gore isnt very useful since i lack the skills, And my int and wiscosts more than an elfs. And my con. It seems a bit unbalanced consideringyou have to be elite before going demon. Demons just seem pointlessto a magical user as they dont gain any real advantage skills or stats wiseto other inferior races... perhaps making demons more worthwhile formagical attuned users would be more balanced?, I think actually less balance isrequired as demons and angels should be superior in every aspect.Set~"
