__Letter "Forsaken Tainted Swords are still specialing.  I wasnt sure exactly what you meant by the specials havent been deleted but disabled.  Did you mean they still like special but you get nothing from the specials i.e hp or sp?  The Tainted Swords special like the Dragon Slayers.  Give just a damage bonus I think.  Just thought I'd mail ya and let ya know."
