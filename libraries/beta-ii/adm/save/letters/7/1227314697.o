__Letter "Jynteral was hunting in the wee hours in the jungles and was slain by a pyromancer named Tauran. All his stuff was taken and he was left with a naked burned body. Thanks to the friends of Tirun some things were given to him anew. Though the armour and diamonds were lost his Pride took a heavy blow."
