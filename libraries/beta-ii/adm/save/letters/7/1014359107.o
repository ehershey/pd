__Letter "If one imm, admin or whatever asks one thing about spells I am walking away.I spent my evening with a player who tested spells for me and let me know how they compaired to fighters of the same level. I have them balanced well I think, but I won't take much more abuse from payers over it. I will not take kindl to any imm or admin who changed a sell without letting me know what they are doing either. I am fed up with player crap and I am on the verge of giving up muds altogether.Stormy"
