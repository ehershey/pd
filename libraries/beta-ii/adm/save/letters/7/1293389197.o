__Letter "Maybe Paladin could be oriented toward a support class.Unlike Warrior/Berserker, Paladins wouldn't dish out tons of damage but theycould take a beating. This would allow them to xp in a different way (big mobsover longer battles, as a party support or multiple medium mobs over longerbattles).In a party Paladin could act like a meatshield that is able to take tons ofdamage, deflecting hits away from party members. This would allow lower-levelparties to take advantage of the exp bonus in higher level areas. Additionally,they could provide some regenerative, protective and beneficial \"spells\" (withemphasis on protective).Solo, Paladin would be better at fighting multiple mobs at once, or one largemob (taking advantage of their meatshield nature).Shields could easily be worked into this fighting style, also (again, opposed to the double wielding of warrior/berserker)."
