__Letter "yeah, see me and Tsuke were online rather illegally at that hour of the day, so thats why i couldn't get back online.the reason we all would've gone link dead at the same time would be the storm. i looked out the window (after having to emerge from my nerd-hermit state from playing that fast-tick game cause i no longer has internet) and it was raining kinda hard and lightning and thunder, so yeah :P i would've sms'ed you or something, or got jon to, but consequently i don't know yours or jon's mobile numbers :P but tis all coolanyway, hope you had a good sleep, and i'll talk to you next time:)Helena"
