__Letter "Just a quick idea don't have to respond but i am making an assumption that vampire quest is going to be elite only and also i think it makes sense that some of the current quest races such as Archangels and Demons shouldn't be able to become vampires when it opens. To me it just seems that they should be beyond undeath and are eternally bound to their gods and thus could not have undeath. They have quested to become this superior race and it would be crazy for them to voluntarily end their life and sacrifice their superior race especially when there is a holy war going on and would not want to weaken their side. They have already had the run of the road already with great stats and strong uber abilities(holyfire) and people who choose not to do them could get have some benefits. :P I hope you atleast consider this :)~Tyste"
