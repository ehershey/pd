__Letter "I was wondering, I've been playing pd for years now, and i've gotten some really buff characters, I really dont have much of a drive to exp anymore so I was wondering If maybe I could apply to be a law immortal. You can ask daboura, whether he likes me or not i'm always finding and reporting bugs, and I know how to recognize cheating, I know a lot of the players really well. I think the mud very badly needs someone to start enforcing our rules. You're not around to see it but on a day to day basis you see people breaking rules left and right and there just isnt anyone who wants to be the \"badguy\" and bust these people. I've never cheated, i've always been able to exp faster than most without it. I'd love to be able to use the time I put into pd to make the mud better. even if I dont exp i'm still at the comp playin pd for like 8 hours a day :P Just figured you can use the help :)i'm not a great coder, or even really a coder at all but I know some things and I can learn more."
