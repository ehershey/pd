It may have some memory savings over mappings when usedin sufficient quantity.// This defines the class itself, but doesn't make a new var of this typeclass ClassName {  int x;  string *stuff;  mapping q;  object me;  function blah;}// This makes a new var of type ClassName, uninitializedclass ClassName myvar;// This works to make an array where each element is of type ClassNameclass ClassName *many;// this initializes the varmyvar = new(class ClassName);// this initializes the class var and sets one of the internal varsmyvar = new(class ClassName, x : 5);// a class var can be the value in a mappingmapping Stuff[\"what\"] = myvar;// you access the data in a class using ->myvar->xmyvar->stuff[1]myvar->q[\"boats\"]myvar->me// this was our array of ClassNamesmany[0]->x// you can cast a return value to be a class like sosaveme = (class ClassName)query_saveme();"
