__Letter "If you are filing harassment against widlfire, rift, or whoever, I suggest you send log to me as soon as possible, otherwise leave the kid alone. yes he is annoying, yes he is a kid, but saying something in a square full of people is not harassment. From the logs I have seen Sugarcandy blew up for no reason and unless there other logs, I am going with these. Use the ignore command, it works great and you do not have to put up with crap. they can never bother you again that way.Stormy"
