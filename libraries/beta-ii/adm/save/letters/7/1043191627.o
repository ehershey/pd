__Letter "Well,  thats my answer to your post, hell no, im not leaving, I love this place.  I am dedicated to it in many ways.  I have a new area in the works with an event to go along with it to hopefully boost players morality of PD.  Ive made several small additions to the guild system since the initial release of the main GS v4.0.  I will help with whatever I can and whatever my rlife will allow.  Even if I am slow coming on for a week, I will be back.  Hell, ive walked to my library in 15 degree weather just to get on pd for an hour.Sincerly,    Whit"
