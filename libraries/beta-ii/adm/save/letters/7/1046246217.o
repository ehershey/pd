__Letter "The ocean is almost ready.  Im gonna add some customization features, such as custom description and such tommorrow.  Those will be 20k gold per desc change.  Then, If I have time, I will have it where monsters jump out of the ocean.  The monsters will be based on a players level.  I dont want a level 100 monster attacking a level 20 ship rider.Also, 10+ can only buy a ship.  Ships are 20k a pop.Whit"
