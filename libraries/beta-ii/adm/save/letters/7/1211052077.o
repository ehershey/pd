__Letter "hey man, look, sorry for trippin' out on you yesterday and stuff. I've played on this mud for like....2 years, but as far as pk goes i'm still an absolute newb. I've only pk'd like....1 other person on here, and it was a LONG time ago, and I've only been pk'd like 3 times (different characters, but still). But anyways, all i'm wanting to say, is as far as the whole, you're an angel, i'm a demon thing goes, i understand the pk or whatever, you're a cool guy, always thought so even when spade and chronicus was around, and i've never known you to pk for something stupid.you also always (usually, unless you're pissed) leave the people's stuff alone. I mean...Beni didn't have anything good on her last night, but you still could've taken it to be mean, but you didn't. But anyways man...if you wanna kill be because i'm a demon i'm cool with that, but as far as trippin' out on you, again, i'm sorry."
