__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Luna to Noxus Wed Sep 26 01:33:26 2007:-----Recently a harass log was received on you from a player containing a comment on the public line that is considered borderline harassment as well as rude and it could've been handled in a different text.  This is an email letting you know that harassment of any kind is not tolerated as you should know by now.  This is a fair warning and if we receive more harassment logs from other players we will have choice but to deal with it."
