__Letter "Well, I understand where you are coming from. You should get another player to determine damage/sp cost for 5-10 attacks in a row if you can. Send your findings to stormbringer along with your ideas on how much damage you should be doing.About sp costs, my init attack (backstab) uses about 140 or more sp, and my circle uses a good 200-250 sp per use, wheras my stab does 300+ for triple and quad stabs at lvl 50 with moderate stats and maxxed skills. Now, what do you think the sp costs would be if I were around your level? Im going to find out pretty soon after I up a few more stats. I dunno if any one has taken a rogue over lvl 50 yet, if you know of one around your level, ask them how much their attacks cost them. Its always useful to see how much costs are with different classes at your level."
