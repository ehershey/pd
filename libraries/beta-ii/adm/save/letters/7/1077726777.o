__Letter "If I know things correctly, numb = muramasa = kenjiru...  who is a personal friend of yours.  That's cool, but I've had multiple independant sources tell me that he had been cheating back when he was a cleric (2k+ damage per hit, 2k wis)  I've also had him respond after I told YOU that I would watch him.  I dont care if you tell him what's going on imm-wise, but if you really want to crack down on cheaters I reccommend you check with your friend first.  At this point I mostly just want to know how it was done so I can fix it.                    -Nightshade"
