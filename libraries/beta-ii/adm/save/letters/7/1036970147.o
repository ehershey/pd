__Letter "COMING SOON...By LeviathasI recently had the oportunity to have an interview with Stormbringer regardinga few issues that I know players are very interested in.  Here is the interview:Stormbringer grins evily.Leviathas gasps in astonishment.Stormbringer says: welcome to the clouds.Leviathas says: Well I wasn't expecting this.Leviathas looks down.Stormbringer smiles happily.Stormbringer says: Well, I have no time for trapsing around the realms forinterviews, better you come here :)Leviathas says: As you know, I have some questions for the paper.Stormbringer nods.Stormbringer says: ask away :)Leviathas asks: Ok.  I know a lot of people in Tirun and the surrounding areas havebeen wondering about the justice system.  Can you give us any hints as to whatwe can expect?Stormbringer says: sure. We are working on making Justice free areas. Whatthis means is once you enter cretain areas, there is no law to come after youif you kill another player in one of these areas. We are also working on aprison island, once a PKer has been banished there, they may never return tothe rest of the world, the Prison area will also be a law free area. It willhave everything needed for exping.Stormbringer asks: did that make more questions?Stormbringer winks with a sparkle.Leviathas says: I'm sure the readers will be curious, but they'll just have to keepreading in the future to get more.Stormbringer nods.Leviathas asks: Another area that a lot of people have been watching with greatanticipation:  The quest races.  Can we get a rough estimate as to when we canexpect them to all be complete?Stormbringer says: well, we are planning on Vampires to go in at the first ofJanuary, which is phase 2's annivesery. I can't give any more details as itcould possibly ruin our plans, but know that vamps will be a completelydifferent kind of race, something never tried on Pd before. As to the others,they will come after since we are planning them around the changes we aremaking for vamps.Leviathas says: Great.  It's good to know that they haven't been forgotten.  I'mreally eager to see them all in action.Stormbringer says: well, we never forget good ideas, only put them on holdtill we get other problems worked out.Stormbringer says: yes, there are always things in the planning stages. Wehave more work than we have workers to complete. That is why some things seemto take so long to get changed or added to the game, things have to be done inorder, bugs and problems first, balance and issues second, fixes and changesto existing areas, then additions to the game. Mix all that in with having alife outside the game and changes and additions can take a long time. There isplans on a thrid contenent, as large as the one tirun is on. I say thirdbecause the second is already int he wroks (prison island) and it, too, willbe about the same size as the Tirun contenet. There is also preliminary workbeing done on different plains of existance, such as hades, elementals, etc.That is all I can say about those though, no need to ruin the surprise Leviathas asks: The rich community has been DYING to know: Are there any powerfulwarriors to your knowledge that are going into the drow mail order bridebusiness?Stormbringer says: well..... I have heard some gossip, but who am I to startrumours Leviathas says: They will be pleased to know.  Thank you very much for your time.Stormbringer smiles happily.Leviathas says: oh wait.Leviathas asks: What is the meaning of life?Stormbringer says: primal darkness calls, dang sorry no timeStormbringer winks with a sparkle.As you can see, the avatars have a lot of cool stuff in the works.  Stickaround."
