__Letter "It's all good, I'm not upset, just don't like copping shit for stuff I'm not responsible for. I think I'm happy without a guild, whilst I'd like the backup, I won't exactly be a good guild member because I'm not interested in getting involved in the wars, especially at my level, with my knowledge. Thanks for the invitation, though. I will definitely consider it. In the mean time all I want is to make as many friends as possible and learn who I can and cannot trust! :):)Rage"
