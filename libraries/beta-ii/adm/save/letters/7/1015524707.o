__Letter "Right, thanks for the mail. Appreciated.Two things however...1) Yes you are correct, you DON'T know how long I have been on PD, or how long I have been mudding, how old I am, or how mature.2) As I said in my post. His point could have gotten across without two posts on the board. And without the 'shouting' and so on. I'd just like to comment that on PD I've been called down for some pretty minor things, just like what faust had written. Anyway, I accept that he may have been angry at the time, and it's ok that he posted it in the first place. However, in all likelihood the admins will reimburse him if it was a bug. If it wasn't then it was his own fault for stealing. Anyway, the point here is that he could have edited his post to be a little more calm and collected, and to properly warn people, rather than keeping with the acronym swearing. I know what FFS and WTF mean, just because he didn't type it out doesn't mean I didn't see it. Oh, and before this Faust was being a real n0b towards me when I was asking Nightshade about some info on the new area, and it would be noted that he chose not to turn off newbie line and ignore me, but rather be insulting.If Faust is a 'pal' then I don't really care, since apparently I'm in serious trouble over that Samul Ku'Thull thing. If you are so intent on paying me back for getting yourself killed, then feel free to do whatever you want. Best not to disturb me in combat, however, since I DO watch my back. Just a little protection against thievery, I learnt that one from angus.I guess it's lucky for me that I'm no longer a little lvl 35 n00b. I think after those two deaths you won't find it as easy to remove an elite, if you don't believe me, partyrange.As you can probably tell, or not, I am a little sick of people with high characters, or who have been playing for a little longer, pushing me around like a little newbie. So far the 180k gold is between you and me, don't make it a stupid guild war. Trust me, my friends can be temperamental.Before you get the wrong idea, no threats, just warnings. I'm not going to be pushed around.	- Aziraphale."
