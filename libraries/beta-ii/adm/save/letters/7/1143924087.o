__Letter "These are something you might want to look into working too. They are extreemly abusable for PK since they take you off the 'who' players list.Possibility if cloak only kept you cloaked for a certain ammount time, or if it drained a certain ammount of sp per tick so you couldn't stay cloaked forever. A bit more like darkshirt and dance in the shadows.As is a person can cloak and go idle... then come back in 2 hours when no one knows they are on, and PK them while they aren't aware their enemies are logged in even.Cloak is powerful enough when someone can't see you in the room. No need to take people off the who-list too."
