__Letter "Stormy, the prospect of money isn't an incentive. I honostly think we should start paying in XP bundles depending on level.Like if a level 50 wrote a story, they'd get 5-6 million xpIf a level 20 wrote a story...they'd get whatever that translates to, I forgot.  But if you approve of that idea I'll research it and draw up a pay chart for your approval and then post it on the boards.Otherwise people will not write articles for the TT.-Hermes "
