__Letter "Hey Gabby,Think you can do me a favor?Due to my own stupidity, which, we both know is quite large... I lost all my equipment...  And I'm no where near powerful enough to get what I really need, that is, the stuff from the drow general.I don't want you to do anything that you have doubts about on my behalf, but I think that you are more then buff enough to put the smack down on that wench and get her complete set of armor for me?I'd appreciate it, even be willing to pay you for your troubles.Yours,Hermes."
