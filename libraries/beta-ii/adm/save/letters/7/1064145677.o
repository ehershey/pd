__Letter "So you're going to hang out with him anyway?  Well, just take care of yourself.  I have gotten a bit attached to those wits of yours and would like you to keep them intact.  I will be gone this weekend, as well, due to work and such, which means I end up sleeping during the day and working all night.  I'll be thinking of you, and look forward to having you back.                      -Paul"
