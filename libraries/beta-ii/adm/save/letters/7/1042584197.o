__Letter "This is something i wrote to you during school. Hey, honey. Here i am sitting in my human physiology class, bored out of my mind. I can't stop thinking about you. Do you know how wonderful of a person you are to me? You're easy to talk to, and a good friend. You're even better a lover. You never fail to please me, and my mind still can't stop reeling from those multiple orgasms you gave me last night. *grins*My nipples are still sore, of course, but that annoying little pain has subsided. Now they just seek for you to kiss and caress them again and take them between your deft fingers, bringing them erect and hard for you. But I know I have to do without that particular caress for the moment. You know what i heard once? That love is stronger than lust, but when both emotions are combined, the potency is overwhealming. I love you every time I think about who you are and how much i want you in my life to be with me and hold me. I lust for you every time we make love, or even just talk about making love. By by the same token, I lust for you when I picture you and me together in real life, you holding me in your arms and kissing me with unrestrained passion. And i love the way you make love to me, so gentle and loving, not at all lacking in passion. I swear i can feel a surge of love radiating from your every touch. I love you. I lust for you. I can't stop thinking about you. You'll have to forgive me for being so long-winded. Typically, i'm not the type to write love letters. But the lecture on nutrients is not particularly interesting and, well...I simply couldn't resist telling you how much i love you. You are so good to me, and i melt at your every touch. For the moment I'll close this letter. Only two more hours before I can get on PD again and see you. Until then,Love,Savannah"
