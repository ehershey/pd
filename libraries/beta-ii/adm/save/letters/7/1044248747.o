__Letter "Hey honey. I'm finally back from my break to real life. I will be on Monday (Tues for you), but I don't know how long because I already know that i have quite a bit of homework. But my parents won't be home til late anyway, so we'll have plenty of time to talk and whatever else. I'd tell you what my real life problem was, but it's a long story so I'll just tell you when i see you on again. *kisses you sweetly*Savannah"
