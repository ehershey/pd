__Letter "Hey love, another day is gone and I realize I am drifting offtarget a little bit here and there. :) But I am thinking of youlots and lots so hopefully those vibes have been reachin ya. :)Let's see...I am representing one guy who was written up for sleeping. He tells me he went into one of the empty dorms into aroom with an air conditioner because he was hot and sweaty and wanted to cool off. He sits on the bed because there are no chairsthen lays down on the bed talking on the phone to his family members.So, armed with this, I put in his appeal. Well, the supervisor callsme in his office and tells me he talked to the guys who caught him.They are in charge of all the dorms. They said they stood there 15 secondsat least looking at him asleep. Then he sensed them and popped up.So, this guy wants me to defend him but won't tell me the truth.This kinda stuff is a little depressing. But, I will try not to letthat get me down. I have one more day of class tomorrow/today! I knock this test outand then only one more class to complete my degree. :) It's kindaexciting. Then, I will have more leeway with sleep, etc and allkinds of stuff. Misty is doing fine. She and I are alone until Fridayas Russ and Myra are on vacation. :) We have had no mishaps, justa lot of her begging for people food. :)I guess that'll do it for this letter. Maybe I can sneak in anotherbefore you're supposed to return today. :) I hope you and Bonita hadthe time of your lives. :) Kinda like Thelma and Louise minus thelaw trouble and jumping off the cliff and Brad Pitt, hehe.All my love,Your James"
