__Letter "Ok, Faust is now my number one hated player. I will not restore him without a full apology, formal and over the newbie line so everyone can hear. I am not putting up with his shit and antics anymore, I like the guy, always have, but this time he stepped a little to far over the line.If I loose his wife as a player too, I guess I will deal. I need this shit like I need another hole in my head. I said IF death gets changed, not that it would. I have no plans to change it now or anytime soon, explain that to the thickheaded mule who threw a tantrum and acted like a 2 year old child. I have had it, I will not sooth things over with anyone anymore, Stormbringer has just become an ass and players can thank Faust for it.Stormy"
