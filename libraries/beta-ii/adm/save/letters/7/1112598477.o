__Letter "Hey, I promoted you to leader. I won't be on too much. I want you to take care of business while i'm gone. I'll be on and off. But there is something that must be done by me with another character. I have things to take care of. If you need anything, just mudmail myself and faust. I will be cheking their mails regularly."
