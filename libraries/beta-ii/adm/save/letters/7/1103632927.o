__Letter "Hows it going chief, I was thinking, it's fairly hard to navagate and learn new places on here, as far as hunting grounds or what not.I was wondering if you'd mind if someone started to make like a public map, that basicly had all the rooms in it, nothing like what's in the room or any secret rooms/QI would be excluded along with any parts you felt were to revealing, I think by putting up semi detailed maps on the PD site would encouage new players and bored players to explore, I'm aware that some clients like zmud have built in map makers but not everyone uses those. If you gave the ok on this mabye we could meet after i got some towns mapped and go over it to make sure nothing is to reavealing and then post em on the PD site. Lemme know what ya think, a good idea of what i was thinking would be at www.shadowmudno-ip.com  almost like those maps but w/o the keys. Just an idea."
