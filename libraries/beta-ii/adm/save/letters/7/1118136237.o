__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Smite to Smite Tue Jun  7 05:22:49 2005:-----hey stormy..just wanted to say..my friend did not put me up to this. i asked him to mail you because i have some hope left for him. and i wanted to say something on my behalf.ya know, you gave me a second chance..cause i made a big mistake and i did not just want to forget about PD..and well me and dubbya have become great friends through this wonderful realm of PD and now we're going into the military together and plan to be friends forever. i definately don't want to leave primal darkness in hte past. and i know dubbya doesn't want to either. he's signing on everyday regretting his decision in remorting and suiciding. and i know i did every time i have on any mud, but most of all PD.ultimately, i look at it..us coming back from the military and coming back to see what's up with primal darkness..and going back to the good ol days. and i know it will be great.i don't know if i am asking or begging because it's hard for me to see PD without him. i felt that way when rubicante got dested because he was a good friend. asmodeus..was a friend from merentha i met in real life and became good friends. and he's now gone. surely, people come and go..but i have a feeling me and dubbya are gonna be around for a long time. would make our days:) i hate asking  you for favors. but i consider myself a faithful PD player and dubbya most definately is too. and if there's mercy in the lands, i think he deserves another chance.thanks for your consideration.."
