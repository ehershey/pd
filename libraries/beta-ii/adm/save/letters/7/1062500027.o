__Letter "I'll assume you didn't go through and try complete the quest, so I'll run through each part of it here.Ok, that room before is the beginning of the quest. You enter the room and when you look at the guy in it you see heis mumbling about his map. \"search for map\" puts that map into the players inventory, and the man notices that it is found and asks you for it. \"give map to man\" will give him the map, and he askes if you will do something for him. \"say yes\" will accept the quest and he hands you back the map, this time with the 'magical enchantment' taken off so you can read it, and tells you where it goes.Go out to the forest and follow the map to the X, the man has already told you to 'kneel' to show you the path. When you do that in that room it creates the exit east, which is remved again after 5 seconds. In that room you can go no further, but you can look at and \"read monolith\". This gives you clues about finding a stone of the sun, and getting a ring from the land of shadows. It also hints that you will need the stone to get the ring.Now it can split, you can kill the guards to get access to the area (I will make the room \"no bump\" so you can't just do it that way. Once you kill one of these people that's it, you can only finish the quest by killing the mobs you need to. So if you can navigate your way through the village to the temple over by the east and kill the mob there and take his necklace, then go back to the old man. Congrats, quest is done the evil way.To do it the good way you will need to fine the Altar of the Sun. That's the room I told you the filename of. I'm the only person with a map that gets there, all I can remember is that it is northwestish from the centre of the forest. You go there, you see the altar with writing around it and there are stones around \"search stones\" will give you a sperical stone. \"place stone on altar\" will give you the sunstone you need. At each step you are given hints at what you need to do.Now you have to figure out that land of shadows is Tenebrae, that shouldn't be too hard, but then you have to find where the place is. I thought that in the tenebrae room mine joins too \"enter\" could be a hidden exit, and you find out about it when you \"look house\" and it says \"the door is wide open, anyone could enter\". Enter there and the room is bare except a trapdoor you can look at, it gives you the hint to \"read writing\" that tells you that you can lift the trapdoor but warns that only the light of the sun can contain the demon, death is the punishment without the light.\"lift door\" or \"lift trapdoor\" or even \"lift trap door\" will add an exit down, which will be removed after 5 seconds. When you go down the monster is spawned when you enter *only* if you do not already have the ring you get for killing him, or if you have finished the quest. If you do not even have the sunstone the demon will attack you, I decided against a true instant death. Still, the guy is a lvl75 antipaladin that uses rush and massacre.The demon dies if you have a sunstone, and disappears, dropping the ring. You get it, and now that you have retrieved the ring you may enter the village. Hopefully you still have the map, but you can probably get it again anyway if you lost it. Go back to the village, you can pass through peacefully, look around. Now, to the north and south are some areas where you can go up and then enter. In each of these places is a guy with a riddle. You have to answer both riddles correctly. For the northern one (power.c) the answer is \"corn\".  For the southern one (knowledge.c) the answer is \"ring\". Once you have completed the riddles you can never do so again.You may now go to the guy in the temple, having answered both riddles correctly he gives you the amulet. Take that amulet back and the old man will see you have it and ask you for it. give it to him, quest is done.I am just about to go through again and make *sure* that you can't do something you shouldn't. Like get a new sunstone, which you can't drop or bury, after you have done the quest. It will be all fixed by the time you read this.So... what would the reward be for all this? - oh yeah, I am going to add a person somewhere that will mention that they found an altar out in the forest, but won't tell you where it is. Hey, at least it narrows it down from anywhere on hte mud. Anyway, that part isn't *necessary* so you can add the quest in before that. I haven't made the description file yet, I need to see how it is done again. I had it saved into zmud but the power went out and I lost it.The area is not quite ready for a walktrhough. It's all good and everything is pretty much jsut right. A few little parts are straggling. I need more monsters for out in the forest, there aren't enough at the moment. I need to change the guards around Rhondale Village to be a lower level, maybe change the description on their items.That should all be done by the time you get on as well.so once you read this, all good for walkthrough.~* Amarael *~"
