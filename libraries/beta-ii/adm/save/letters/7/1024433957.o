__Letter "Message 3 by Hepualahaole: ancalagonhey, I was looking at my book again cal , and I saw some stuff that maybe notour class can use, but it's worth looking into.  Dragon Attacks:WIng = slam opponents with wings, even when flying.Tail Slap = Can slap one opponent each round with it's tailCrush = A flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size can land on opponents, using it's whole body to crush them.  Only effective against opponents 3 ormore sizes smaller than the dragon.  It' affects as many creature as can fitunder the dragon's body.Tail Sweep = dragon can sweep with it't tail as a standard action.Grappling = Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though thier crush attack andSnatch feat allows them to do this.Snatch = A dragon gets a hold with a claw on a creature four or more sizessmaller, it squeezes each round for automatic claw damage.Those are some of it, stormy asked a question on the dragon line...so I'llcontinue with another postMessage 4 by Hepualahaole: continuedFrightful presence = scare the living heck out of a opponentOkay spells that I find in this...oh by the way, we would have to change someof these descriptions or spell/ability names cause I'm typing right from theDungeon an Dragon's Monster Book.   These are just ideas.Spells:Immunities = All dragons are immune to sleep and paralysis effectsSpell Resistance = As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells andspell-like abilitiesBlindsight = A dragon can ascertain creatures by nonvisual means, by smell,sound and vibrations feltBack to abilities....It said that Red, copper, gold and silver dragons have the Jump skillHover = When flying, a dragon can halt it's forward motion and hover in place,fly straight down, or fly straight up.  While hovering, it can attack with it'sbite and all four feet, or tail sweep (note the or, can't do both at the sametime), and if they like, use breath attack.one more spell Okay for black dragons...according to this bookBreath Weapon = Acid (but I like our breathe the way it is)Water Breathing = We can breathe underwater indefinitely and freely use breathweapons, spells and other abilitites while submerged.Corrupt Water = We can stagnate water, making it become still, foul, and unableto support animal life.  The ability spoils liquids containing water.  (Don'tknow how we could use this one, but it could spark an idea)Charm Reptiles = It operates as a mass charm spell that works only onreptileian animals.  The dragon can communicate with any charmed reptiles.Darkness = pretty self explanitoryInsect plague = same as darknessPlant growth = Black dragons are drawn to marsh-like enviroments, because of afew reasons...One being is that as the black dragon gets older, they start tosmell quite foul, so swampy areas help mask the smell.  Second reason being isthat black dragons like the cover of plants, for ambush reasons.  So aftersaying this...plant growth is like a camouflage ability.Well that is all that it said about our type of dragons, and dragons ingeneral.  I'm not going to bother with the other dragons, unless stormy wantsme to.  Maybe between the two of us, we can help facelift the black dragons alittle, not so much to become powerful, but to keep the fun aspect up.  It would be neat to play up the trickery aspect of the black dragon, if not forbattle reason, but for role-playing, it'll be good.  I mean, to compare, theKataans summons, are not for battle, though they can fight, I like summoningthem up and just play around with em cause I know I'm the only class that cando it, necros have it, but thier's is more for battling.  Who wants to walkaround with hordes of undead following them everywhere?  I don't even know ifthat spell still exist, but it was just an example.Now that we have our own board, (thanks stormy)  maybe we can change thedescription of our personal hall.  I plan on being here more often :P I know I know, I'm getting wordy over here, so I'll stop :)"
