__Letter "you wanted to go off on whit for helping me you wanted to go off on samantha for helping me well you need to controll your temper furiae is not your concernand if a devorce from your char is what it takes for you to see that then i guess that is what i have to doand crying to samantha about my not texting you about how it's your b-day no i knew it was on the 16thit just didn't register that you were a day ahead of meso if you was to be an ass over me not texting you and questioning samantha about me then you know what you can question now all you want because right now i'm done being stuck in the middle between my best friend and a guy i like i'm doneStacey"
