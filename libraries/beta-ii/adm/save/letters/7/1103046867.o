__Letter "hi lov,not a prob, i saw you in square, you'd been idle for quite awhile.There is reboot in 10 minutes, so if I'm gone, I'll come back in a bit.I'll check to see if you're on. I have thought of a poem for you too.I'll work on in until I catch up to ya. I prob will have time tonightto get on if I can get the computer. Trev brought his laptop so Icould prob use that. Hope to talk to ya soon.*hugs*"
