__Letter "I will look into what I believe it may be, then.  If you connect to PD with a wedding ring in your inventory and are unmarried, it will cause that to happen.  If it errors, it will stop and the rest of your inventory wont be loaded (which is why you lost some items.)  I will look into making sure you dont have a ring after being divorced.          -Nightshade"
