__Letter "Hey love, I was just starting to watch Grease when my Rayna sensestarted tingling. (It's like Spider-Man's spider-sense but notquite as reliable...yet. :)) So, I decided since I was downstairs,I needed to make that computer play a sound when you came on. AsI got to the computer, I saw you had come on, talked to Yang, wentlinkdead and Yang (Kikiyo) was 6 min idle. Anyway, I am into Greasenow and up to the sleepover. Sandy decided to be a pen pal to someguys in Korea and is outside on the porch about to start her song.I am eagerly awaiting what happens next. :) But! I will walkMisty first then check on here to see if you returned. At that point,we'll see what we'll see. :D Lovin' that Rayna,Your James"
