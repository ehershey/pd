__Letter "Daboura,I would be able to do my job a lot better if I could banish IPs.  I don't need to be able to dest, as I can always reserve that judgement for you.  But arrest falls short of dealing with a lot of offenders who simply sign on alternate characters and cause even more trouble.Just food for thought.  I suppose I can repeatedly arrest, but that feels like working around my limitations as opposed to admitting them.Your call.  I can do my job either way, but I can do it better with Banish, and you can always undo whatever decisions I make with that command.Levi"
