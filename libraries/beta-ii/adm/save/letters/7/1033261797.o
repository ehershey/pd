__Letter "Let it be noted that when your modem does that whole messing up thing... you do NOT go linkdead. You go idle. In the most recent case of the forbidden forest, we all know how much of a BAD thing that could be. Luckily, since I'm around... I guarded you for a while till I thought you wouldn't be back for a while... and signed on as you and forced your char into link-deadness. Hope you get it all worked out soon man.Ryan"
