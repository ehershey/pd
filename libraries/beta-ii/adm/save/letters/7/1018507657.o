__Letter "I'm a lil drunk so I'm sayin this otherwise I'd keep it inside cause im spiteful like that but oh well, what you did and have been doing hurt and pissed me off and that's why I'm making another guild instead of rejoining ds, however I value the friendship we did have so I'm not holding any anger towards you I'm just forgetting it and moving on, but I won't be a part of ds because I felt betrayed and I value respect more then anything, you know that.  I respect you as a person, but not as a leader.  I don't mean to insult, I don't insult people, I'm just blunt, I speak what I feel and I hope you understand I mean no disrespect.  This letter is kind of fucked up cause I can't think straight but I hope the message is clear regardless.  I hold no ill will, just don't trust you like I used too."
