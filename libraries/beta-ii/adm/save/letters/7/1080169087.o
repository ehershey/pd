__Letter "Damnit necros suck now! I ended up dying twice in a row cause spells are so bad now :( :( I've lost 4 levels and lots of skills. Plus -1 on nearly all my stats. It's really frustrating. I was almost ready to cide, but the only thing that kept me from it is knowing you were lvling up a char to party wtih me. :/Anyway, I haven't had the chance to get my levels back yet. So far I'e only earned one level back, so right now I'm at 33. :/Damn this sucks. :("
