__Letter "Just in case it shows in the logs that both Blue and Wisp were on at the same time i'll explain what happened.Blue is my daughters character and she didn't know i was still logged on when she logged on.  She is 14 and doesn't know how the client worked and typed who.  She thought just disconnecting the window would disconnect me but it didn't so she came and got me to log off my character.Thank youWisp"
