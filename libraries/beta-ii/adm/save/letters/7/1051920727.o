__Letter "I did the 21 day in 93 (  10 year coming up  ) and I can very easily say that it was the best time by far I've had in my life. The whole experience is about having fun and giving you a little insight into the person you can become and the relationships you can have when you have no responsibilities other than the interpersonal relationships you build with others.I met a little Australian girl on one of those 21 day trips who was easily the love of my life. We were like 2 jigsaw pieces, EVERYTHING about us matched so well. We had enough time to plan another 3 months in Europe then the rest of our lives together. She was so beautiful it still hurts.  But sadly for me, there was a Canadian girl who in every way was nice but not outstanding, but physically, was just slightly the better of my lass. She was easily the most physically beautiful girl I had ever met (and fortunately I been blessed in the circles I've mingled). She was honestly stunning. I had resisted her manouvers the whole trip. But on the last night back in England before the tour broke up we had one more night out. My girl retired early to her room so she could have a good rest before waking up to get us ready to leave the next morning on the rest of our lives. She said she would come around early to wake me, so I was left with my new friends and Miss Canada. To this day I don't understand what changed but that night for some reason (fuck she was beautiful though) I slept with Miss Canada.I still remember like it was yesterday, waking up to a sweet kiss on my lips. With Miss Canada soundly sleeping away in the crook of my arm, I looked up to see the love of my life looking down at me with tears in her eyes. In them I could see the rest of my (our?) lives seeping away. I jumped out of bed, got some pants on and went running after her. But all I could get out of her between her sobs was that she understood. Understood what? That I was a dog?Anyway, she left on a bus that morning with a kiss from her soft lips goodbye, but never once looking me in the eye again.What was to follow was the great chase around europe after her, but I never did catch her again.I have only wept uncontrollably twice in my adult life. Once watching her leaving in her bus. The next when I left her after meeting her again back in Australia.My life has been empty after my 21 day Contiki tour of Europe in 1993. But with all the pain since it was the best time of my life. If I could go back and live it all again, I would only change 6 hours of it. But I dream of having that time over again."
