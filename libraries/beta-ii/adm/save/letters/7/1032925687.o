__Letter "Deal Wisp,  Oops... that was supposed to be \"Dear\" not \"Deal\"... hmm... I wonder if this thing can be edited and not started over. ::ponders:: Bah... oh well. I hope things are going well in the land of yours. Probably doing your thing at your job, beating, err... I mean \"putting up with\" your kids, ::grins:: and just having a grand old normal time of it. I really don't have a reason to write this letter... nor anything to say in particular. I simply felt like bantering on about nothing for no reason to someone, and I chose you first. How oddly neat chance and randomness can be. Hmm... but was it random? Did I have a reason to pick you? Why was it the first name that popped into my head? No clue.  I start a new job at a place called Firestone tomorrow. They sell tires, do oil changes, work on cars, that kinda thing. I was working at another place, but the manager was a dick and called up my school and got the school to more or less fire me from his work place. He can do that thanks to it being a \"school credit\" job where I learn to do what I want to do with cars. Kinda retarded if you ask me. Little peckerhead had me measured for clothes 2 days before he did this. The real kicker there is that he's charging me $100 in uniform costs for it and I bet he just told them to cancel it and it didn't cost him a dang penny. I for one didn't get to see any of those shirts or anything... the putz.::sighs:: Todays a real slow day. I need to get more sleep I think. It's making my mind wander and do funny things. Anger has been a real issue as of late... but not \"Rah I'm just so pissed off\" anger... more like a sudden wave of pure hatred will wash over me if something triggers it... I feel it in my entire being for but a moment... and just like it began, it's al over and I feel totaly \"normal\". As normal as normal can be in my tired and \"off\" state.newb winks at Azire.::rolls his eyes:: Yea... there we go. Forgetting I was in the middle of an email and trying to be nice when people are blushing at my title. It currently says \"Cookie - Idle hands play games\". I likes it cause I made it up in my head and it works on LOTS of levels. I mean... think about it. Games... what exactly do I mean by \"games\"? Video-games? Board-games? Or how about mind games? Touching Games? Kissing and secret games? One may never know... ::smirks quietly to himself::I'm suprised I haven't duplicated any paragraphs yet. That impresses me. Still not used to the zmud thing when I'm on this computer. get's me all wigged out sometimes. Wow.... shiver. Too much Mt. Dew make Ryan something something.... \"Go crazy?\".... \"Don't mind if I do!!!!\" ::runs amuck inside his own head for a good while before continueing on this letter::Ok... I'm sure that's enough of my pointless bablings... forgive me, delete this letter, and have a wonderful day.~ Indeed I am forever Dieing tomorrow... but never today. ~ Ryan - Cookie"
