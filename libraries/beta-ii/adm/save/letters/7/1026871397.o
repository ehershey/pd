__Letter "Post number 34 by Oram...\"..interesting..\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------There isn't too much reason to this post.. it is rather interesting tho ifyou want to know some fun things about your administrators here on themud..not to important or anything cuz no one realy cares if they are human..which is what they try and attempt to not be.. as you will see in this postlater on down.. so here is the truth about some shit that happened to me onthis mud.. that means nothing to me now but makes a fun post and will makefor some interesting reading and afterposts.. even if I wont' be readingthem.. so please people.. don't be stupid and post things to meafterwards..im not reading any posts after I post this.. I won't even be on merentha soinsulting me will be quite pathetic.First after me and pet just chatted a few times joking around like I dowithall my normal friends guys AND girls.. and we just joke around cuz itsstupid fun and means nothing.. than jewel started being weird and for somereason thought there was something up.. (umm eeww?) so I just kinda ignoredit mostly cuz it was basically just bullshit so I never really tried toreassure her cuz umm why should I always have to? Jeez can't some people besmart enough to figure it out themselves and not become some jealous hagover nothing?Jewel tells you: you know that petrarch is the one that caugh violetfeeding not me right?reply i do now< You reply to Jewel: i do nowJewel replies: well i guess thats par for course.Jewel replies: you and him are together.reply i didn't realize she was, so it won't happen againYou reply to Jewel: i didn't realize she was, so it won't happen again>Jewel replies: nah. i feel like a fool.reply i actually figured because of the misspelled words :PYou reply to Jewel: i actually figured because of the misspelled words :P>Jewel replies: let me know when things are not so great between you two.Jewel replies: when he becomes too demanding. understand?reply me and who?You reply to Jewel: me and who?>A shadow tells you: i am not stupid. something between you and petrarch.reply ohYou reply to Jewel: oh>A shadow tells you: you can tell him over icq - htere is a spammer - hecandest it.. i dont care much anymore.tell jewel whats wrong?Tell whom what?Jewel replies: laugh. everytime i think i am over him.. the hurt comesback.we are not together. i have no reason to hurt.reply you and petrarch?( I accidently deleted something here I think cuz when I copied it overfrommy saved files it did something funky on me)You reply to Jewel: i thought he was like.. in his 20's..?Jewel replies: arent you?reply i am 16 :)You reply to Jewel: i am 16 :)>Jewel replies: holy shit.reply i didn't know there was something between us...You reply to Jewel: i didn't know there was something between us...>Jewel replies: isnt there?.Jewel replies: folling around?Jewel replies: dont matter. i have to go. still feel like shit. and i dothink there is something more.And than there was a little miscommunication that went on between me andpet as to what 'fun' was.. I figured he was showing me somethng cool on someother mud but he was thinking cybersex.. im not trying to gross people outhere.. this is just my proof of what happened.. I really didn't do much cuzI had no clue what the hell to do or how to get out of the situation that Iretardedly got myself into.. I'll admit I can be quite naïve sometimesPetrarch move his hand down your chin and over your shoulder where hecaresses your arm, up and down your arm several timesAutosave.Petrarch caresses your shoulder, then slowly moves his hand down over yourbody, lightly going over one breast, then over your stomach and down toyour hipPetrarch kisses your cheek, then moves his lips over yoursPetrarch slips his hand under your t-shirt and begins to caress your legsPetrarch places his lips against yours and with his, opens your lips andbegins stroking your tounge with hisPetrarch move his hand up under your shirt and starts massaging your titsOh yeah and jewel.. heres some more of that log that doob or atmos orwhatever he wants to call himself sent you.. but I don't know if he sentthis part.. or a lot of the other parts where I was asking him for help onhow to get out of the situation.. knowing the loser.. im thinking he justshowed you what he wanted you to see.(my icq's to deniro at the time)u better not.. please...i dunno what to do here, pet's doin all the work..isorta feel bad.. i mean i gotta do somethign! even if i dont' want took.. everything is A-OK i fixed it..we stopped before it got too bad..andthey best part is we stopped =)Ok.. so basically pet didn't know I wasn't planning on the same thing hehadin mind.. I didn't know how to tell him.. seeing how I had a character Ididn't need dested for maybe if he got pissed.. I mean I didn't know how hewould react if I was like.. umm.. I don't want to do this what were youthinking? You know? Ofcourse ya don'tanyways.. so since im alreadysitebanned and dested I had nothing to lose by putting this up.. and Ifigured no one cared.. but seeing how jewel put me through a lot of shitbecause of this situation at the time and I really deserve a little paybackon her for being such a bitch to me.. oh wait.. here it gets worse.. afterIwrite a HUGE fake apology type thing to jewel basically telling her she'sgod and im scum and all this other stuff.. trying to keep myself from beingdested because of al the work I had put into heathee at the time.. shedidn't even deserve an apology in the first place.. we did nothing onmerentha.. pet is her mud spouse HERE but not on another mud.. not anywhereelse.. so even if we were to have done something on the internet who isjewel to control me or pet? she had no right to do what she did to me.. okheres her lil mudmail to me later onHeathee,  I would love to tell you how much I was hurt  personally by the log that I recieved, but the  truth of the matter is - personally - that is  my problem. So I speak as an admin protecting  her mud.  What you did wrong.  Your mails indicate you have no clue as to what  you did that was wrong. You disrespected me, my  position on the mud, my mudmarriage. You accused  me of watching you openly to other players.  You mock me in that log.  You accused Petrarch of forcing you to do things  you didnt want to do. Petrarch says that you  made up all that stuff, I have to belive him,  for the good of merentha.  I wont quote the gory details, you claim to be  a innocent little virgin - but what i have seen  and the fact you advertise yourself as a prostitue  on icq shows that you are not innocent and you  invite things openly - you invite the entire  world. You cant be both. You should have a little  bit of respect for yourself. You throw a tantrum  over a relationship posted in the mud, yet you  role play the seductress. Actions do speak louder  then words, and if you truely want some respect,  the act accordingly. You owe me an apology - a  better one then what I got, one that truely shows  you recognize the impact of events. What if your  father found that icq log? The Admin of merentha  forced himself upon you. Who is accountable for  that?  What Petrarch did wrong.  Petrarch was wrong for not desting violet when  found feeding. He was wrong for encouraging  flirtation, he was wrong for taking you to  the other mud. He owes you an apology. His  behavior is unacceptable.  What I did wrong.  I allowed my personal feelings to convalute  the situation, I had opportunity to stop this  before it went to the other mud. I blindly  turned my head and was filled with shame.  I allowed petrarch to explain away things that  ...  Lets just say I allowed it to happen.  That will never happen again.  Merentha.  Because of my own failures, I will not dest you.  You must do the following:  If you have not done so, you are to clean out  your icq directory. Look for all temp files  on your computer, delete icq or aim or any  other place you have talked, e"
