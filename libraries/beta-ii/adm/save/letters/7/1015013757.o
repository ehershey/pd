__Letter "Okay, I've got it all pretty much figured out. I wasn't sure what info you needed, so I decided to give you everything I could think of. I should prolly warn you that I put a few extra bits of extra info in the rooms.Ok here goes:Hall Description:get stone from diamondrub stoneYou are standing in the Hall of Light, meeting place of the Illuminati. Along the length of the hall huge round white marble pillars support the weight of the tower. Oddly, black streaks swirl slowly around the pillars. The large stained glass windows on the surrounding walls unceasingly project their heavenly images perfectly upon the floor between the pillars despite the position of the sun. The floor is all polished white marble, and there is enough room to fit 100 people comfortably. At the far end of the hall you can see three thrones floating absolutely still in the air. Doors lead to other rooms on the first floor.It is quite a sight to behold.[look throne or thrones provides: The front throne is made of pure black marble and seems to absorb light from the air around it. Set out from the high back like a crown is a skull with a golden starburst impressed on it's forehead. The words \"M'Hael Artanis\" have been etched upon it The other two thrones sit to either side of the first, and slightly below. They are identical in almost every way, being made out of solid platinum inlaid with gold they have a small back and each has a golden halo floating above it. One has the words \"Asha'man Aziraphale\" inscribed upon it, the other says \"Asha'man Gabriel\".][> Exits: Prayer , Treasury , Store , Out <]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Praying Room Description:This is the prayer room for the Tower of Light and it is here where the Illuminati come to pray to their gods. Plants of all descriptions surround the room and there are many beautiful flowers to look at. A large statue of a cleric with her hands cupped before her serves as a unique fountain as the water trickles between her fingers into a pool at her feet. The walls and roof are made of a clear glass that give the room the distinct impression of being outside. You feel at peace here.<Pray to recover hp/sp/mp> (or whatever you do and get)You smell the wonderful aroma of flowers. (This is an actual smell, if you didn't guess)[look flowers will provide: The flowers are very beautiful and add to the peace of this place][look fountain will provide: The fountain is made of silver inlaid with gold and the water is crystal clear][> Exits: Hall <]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Treasury Room Description:The treasury for the Illuminati, this is where the guilds gold is stored. The room is bare white everywhere except for a small inscription on the opposite wall.[look inscription provides: (How the treasury room works, I don't know so I can't tell you)][> Exits: Hall <]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Entrance Room Description:Before you is a huge steel gate with metallic spikes atop each of the vertical poles, it is the entrance to the Tower of Light and Hall of the Illuminati. As you approach you feel your skin tingle as you walk upon the hallowed ground. You notice that there is a bronze plaque with an inscription set upon the steel bars. The two guards watch you warily.[look plaque will provide: A bronze plaque with an inscription, perhaps you should read it][read plaque will provide: The plaque reads:(new line)(Insert the poem thing from our help file here)](Guards in this room please)[> Exits: Hall , North <]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Can the guards each wield a sword of light and wear some holy looking armour? Or is that too high a lvl? If it is too high then we just want them to have ordinary swords called Lightblades, and plain armour called, err, Lightplate. heheh.Can the guild hall be located just west of the church, on the south side of the road? Seems a good place to put it, right next to the other holy place.I think that's it. Just tell me if you need more info, or if i gave too much :), I should be on again in about 6 hours.Oh, on non-guild stuff. Is Annar the nation or something of the archangels? Because the language is Annarian, and the inscription in the temple (which I don't recognise despite the fact I am learning Annarian) does say Annar Tilin, Shir att sol Annari. Heh I memorised that. Anyway, I wondered because I cnsidered using the word is osme descriptions, but thought I would make a fool of myself if I was wrong.Okay bye now - Asha'man Aziraphale of the Illuminati (no prizes for guessing where I got Asha'man from, I am so unoriginal, :) heheh)"
