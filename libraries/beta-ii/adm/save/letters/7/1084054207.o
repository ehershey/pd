__Letter "he's been pk'ing my weaker guild members non stop recently, if something is not done i'm going to have to respond in the same way... and i hope kumi's constant crying about her guild members being killed doesnt give her members the right to do it whenever they please.. he's killed about 8 people in the last weekm, they way i look at it that gives me the right to kill him 8 times...my members are my brothers and sisters and i aint gonna put up with it"
