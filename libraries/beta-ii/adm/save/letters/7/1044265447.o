__Letter "You claim that all immortals are fair, etc. Well I have found that this is not completely true.I asked Daos why exactly he said something to me about what I was asking and saying over newbie, he said 'mostly because other players were getting pissed'. I then go on to ask him why nothing was done when I and just a few, one or two, players were getting pissed about Kurgan being an idiot. He said, and I quote 'That is just Kurgan's personality, we just need to ignore it.' I then stated that it is my personality as well, to say annoying things and piss people off, as you know. He had no reply, to as Kurgan is a real life friend of his, where I am nothing but a player of a mud that he is an immortal at. All of this could have been avoided if I got the very same treatment that Kurgan got from him. If him and everyone else ignores my personality, then nothing would have been said. Kurgan goes off on newbie and rants and raves idiotic things, and Daos just ignores it, with no consiquences. I want you to think long and hard about all that went on and was said before and after, like I just stated, check the logs of tells if you wish, to check what I have said. Theres a tell from Kurgan to me, telling me to ask Daos about Kurgan IRL, about how he looked or how big he was or something to that affect. All the things I stated check out, double check as I said before if you do not believe me. Think about all this and see if you think thats fair treatment of EVERY player or not.-Kenjiru-Byblos"
