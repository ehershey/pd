__Letter "Hi Stormbringer,Can you please have a quick look around this area in builders?/wizards/amarael/icefields/tundra/room/spawn_room.cYou 'goto' that room and just move around. The descriptions and mobs haven't been done yet, and the exits are about 85% complete, but you get the general idea. This this is good for wilderness areas outside of towns? I can modify it to be pretty much any shape with any special areas inside it. I think it is a pretty powerful tool for adding large wilderness areas that have small villages and so on inside them."
