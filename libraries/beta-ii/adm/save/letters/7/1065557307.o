__Letter "Hey, I tried to get a few guild items into DS, and my leader said they were good ideas and he'd make the items, but never did.  How reliable, huh?  Anyway, the dark leather sack I usually use that's a DS guild item no longer auto-loads for me since I switched guilds.  Could you please make an AoD item, I was thinking: %^BOLD%^BLACK%^A%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^o%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^D %^RESET%^BLUE%^H%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^o%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^y %^RESET%^%^BLUE%^S%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^t%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^c%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^h%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^e%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^l%^RESET%^.  It should be a sturdy bag that also looks nice.  I'm not sure if it costs money or something to do something like this, but I can pay you or pay whoever it is to create this guild item.  If you don't like this idea let me know, I won't get mad or anything, I just really want a nice blue bag that auto-loads.  Take Care Aute-jen(kumi)"
