__Letter "Without getting into too much detail cause the whole thing is rather confusing to begin with so I'll just give a brief version of everything I know (which isn't much by the way)First thing first, As much as I can't stand pyro, I know that he isn't cenn.  Wraith came on and said woah there's cenn and arrested him on the spot, 1 2 3.  I know that pyro isn't cenn cause I've spoken with his older brothers (inferno and deathshroud)Then wraith said that pyro was hacked and told him to change all his passwords with all his alts, which pyro did.  Now since this, my hubby has returned home from work and told me that on that icky mud (merentha) cenn and pyro were friendly enough towards each other to exchange passwords, if you want a better account of that, you'll have to ask hubby, I'm not involved with this info.  Later still, pyro acted as though his char was hacked, and didn't understand how someone could do this, and he denied his friendship with cenn.  Besides all this info, pyro should still be arrested for multi-playing because I was on for that and I have put in my notepad the second instance he has done this.Now on a diffrent note, Daos panic and IM me to get onto builders cause another person cided.  I did, and did a last cre and well, pyro was rambling about a whole bunch of nothing, that daos had to explain that wraith forced off a coder.  I'm sure his reason was valid, but from what I could gather from the last of the cre lines, that everything was okay, and then out of nowhere slysar said jerks and he was no longer part of the mud.  Since then wraith has restored him...but what I want to know is why wraith has been flying off the handle?  I know he has a job to do, but in short time today he was ready to off everyone that looks at him funny.  I like wraith, so I don't want him to disappear, but someone needs to talk to him about his rash actions against people, and knowing that you have patience I never would have, I was hoping you'll talk to him about these bahaviors.ThanksHep"
