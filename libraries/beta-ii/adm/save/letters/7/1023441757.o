__Letter "Nate,  Remind me when we are both on next to give you the extra darkmail I have on me. It's hella better than your scalemail, if you remember from way back when I used to let you barrow it way back when, anyways. I have an extra now, got it with wisp. I'll give it to you to see if it autos. I know it does above 40, somewhere between there and 45... not sure when exactly though. Anyways, chow.Ryan"
