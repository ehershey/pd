__Letter "Quit stalking Joey, it is a clear case of harassment and it will be punished. Whatever he did to you with an alt you take up with that alt, not a new character of his. That is in clear violation of the multiplay rules. You have been warned, next comes punishment if it does not stop right now and harassment is only punishable with a dest.Stormy"
