__Letter "I'm not getting any online access from my grandparents, and I am passing through Cincinnati today, so I wanted to drop you a holiday greeting...I must admit... not getting ANYTHING from you in the past several weeks makes me wonder what's going on? I hope you're well, and still talking to me, and so on.Do you know what it feels like to toss yourself down a steep hill, chasing after a tumbling dread pirate?-H"
