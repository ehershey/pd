__Letter "I did it cause i did not recongize the name and i questioned hisbeing on builders. When i questioned him, he got really disrespectful.I had arrested him only until i was able to talk to a staff on this.It has been lifted since Nulvect said he granted him permission.Please let Daos and me know when someone is being granted access tobuilders so this dont happen. I need to know who is being allowed onbuilders and who is not.In either case, I think you woulda errored on the side of caution toin my position. Confronted with someone you don't know who basicallytells you off... I think you would react the same way. To me thatcame across as someone not ment to be on builders if not a hacker.So I froze his character until a staff member chimed in on the matter.Ironman"
