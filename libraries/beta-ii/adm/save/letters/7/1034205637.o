__Letter "On the topic of faithwings. Unless of course Prator has already spoken to you, I'd like to shift faithwings to an AC of 4 with a 2 round delay on wear/remove. I think that was what you posted if not then just adjust it to suit. I always thought flying should have a delay on it anyway. Like Balloons in Meren, But no where near that long of course. But this seems fair. Anyways thanks in advance%^BOLD%^WHITE%^)%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^BLACK%^Solar%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^WHITE%^(%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^BLACK%^ Halo"
