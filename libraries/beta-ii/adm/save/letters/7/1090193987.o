__Letter "There has been a lot of stress lately.  If i didn't want you in the guild, you wouldn't have been allowed in.  Yes i said you reminded me of Kumi and Pyro, but that isn't all bad.  You have youthful, quizzical approach to you, you ask question, you search to find answers.  I'm sorry you found me so unwelcoming, where you actually were welcome.Wisp"
