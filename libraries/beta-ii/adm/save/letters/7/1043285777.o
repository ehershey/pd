__Letter "Hey sorry to bug you with this cause I know your busy, but could you please look at vortex?Its my level 50 spell and its damage is exactly double my hellfire. Since vortex paras me for a few rounds i can cast hellfire twice as often so vortex is no upgrade. Plus it takes over 100 mp per mob so i spend a lot of downtime waiting for mp (which i think is a good way to balance it actually).Level 25 mages kills as fast as me using acid cone and level 30s who use psistorm. Hellfire is weak which is good considering kataans arent pure casters, but at least vortex could get some upgrade considering how long it paras you. Holyfire for example does more damage at the same level than vortex and can be cast twice as often. Vortex is pretty dangerous to use because of the para effect of it. If the damage could be upgraded it would be really nice as right now i am better off using hellfire. It takes 5 rounds to kill a 25k monster with vortex at lvl 70 with max skills because of the para effect.Thanks for listening. sorry if i'm whinning a little bit.-- Ruby"
