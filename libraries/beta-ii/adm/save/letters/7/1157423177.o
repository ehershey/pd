__Letter "Here are some thug ideas that an older mud used. The thugs were street-wise people. Using the tricks and trades of the street to aid them in combat and with selling items, etc. Compare was an item that all thugs got, along with a certain size-up that never failed accuracy. Like a consider <living>, but even better. They also got maim-like moves. Dirt was the name of one of the abilities. The thug would pick up a pile of dirt and toss it in the opponents eyes. This made specials miss more often and made idles do less damage or either that miss. Another move was kneecap. A thug would take a blunt weapon and slam it into the opponents kneecap, making it fall to the ground. For a mage it could stop a spell, for a physical type it could make them miss a special and maybe lightly slower. There was a move called Box. The thug would take both fists and slam them into the opponents temples, causing difficulty of sight, thinking, and overall moving. It's more or less using all of the maims in one foul shot. There was also Knee. It kneed the opponent in the groin, causing immense damage to that area. To the females it just stunned them, for the males it caused more damage and also had a high chance of making them drop their weapon. I have some more ideas if you want them, these are just some to maybe catch your attention."
