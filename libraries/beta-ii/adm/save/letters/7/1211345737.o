__Letter "I was wondering, if for the price of a new guild in the guild prices file, if a new guild would be able to make with the new influx of players and the fact that we have just as many active players as when we had twice as many guilds?  Most players are currently in Forsaken, but with the recent change of ownership, I don't see the guild lasting long, and I'd really like to have one that I believe will last long and stay strong.  i hope you atleast consider it... thanks :)"
