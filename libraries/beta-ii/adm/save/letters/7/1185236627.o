__Letter "I have coded a mock version of the mudlib with the modificationsfor my version of the senses. The directory with those modifiedmudlib files is /std/IRON_OBJ_CHAINThe code that stores the senses input is in /std/obj/iron_sense.cThe commands that interperate the info stored are in /cmds/iron_sensesI have one mock room right now that uses this system wholely atm.The room is /wizards/ironman/experimental_room.cStand in that room and you will have all the functions present withinthe room to use call upon. You could also code objects. Just inheritthe files in the /std/IRON_OBJ_CHAIN instead of stock mudlib files.Ironman"
