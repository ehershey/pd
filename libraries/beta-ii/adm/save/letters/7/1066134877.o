__Letter "Omg man Cory thinks he is top shit because he is an assassin with 65 dex.He is talking about how good he is and showing off in front of like level5's and shit. Comparing his char to my 24/7 idle Aziraphale. Omg.Apparently you dropped him off here today? Anyway, just lettin ya know that he is staying somewhere else now. My Aunty's, you know where we had that LAN for two weeks? He is staying there with her now. So I bet he asked for you to drop him off here so he could abuse the computer, rather than just walk to the place he is staying or something.Anyway, I need to show you place I'm moving to on the weekend so you know where it's all happening :pOmg, and talk about Cory = abusing anything he doesn't own. When we went to get the wiper blades he just *had* to go lead foot, planting it all the time. I am talking cruising at 80 in 3rd gear, 4k rpm, just so he can get the good acceleration in the middle of traffic like Byron.omG. Ok enough ranting."
