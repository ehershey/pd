__Letter "lookThis one is called holyshout i think it should be like a spell where itparalyzes a specific mob in the room 'cept the party members I think this should be a fun spell to play around with Another spell should be holystrike where it should be used in conjunction with the sword where a paladin mutters a prayer into his sword in battle and after 2 rounds this unleashes a holy power and cleaves thru anything basically (the whole idea of a pali only cleaving if the monster is evil is not fond of by most palis such as dispell all since it barely works and such) I think palis should worry about their align and all but not how they can kill something since they are fighters the same goes with Antipaladins"
