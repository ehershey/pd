__Letter "I think either Cleric or Kataan. Cleric seems to need help standing on their own, it could be frustrating to have to always xp with someone. But I dont have a high cleric so I can't say too much. Kataan's are an interesting concept but are simply done. I like the hellfire spell but I'd think theyt would be like a necro, but like totally hardcore and dealing with demons not undead.thats all"
