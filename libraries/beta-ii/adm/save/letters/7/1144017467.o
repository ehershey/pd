__Letter "SentinelsEven in times of peace are military units required to patrol and safeguard the free world. Thus it seems true that elite organizations would form and band together to hone and practice finely tuned skills. Enter the Sentinels guild, stationed in Tirun. Mainly made of fighters and martially adept adventurers, their goal is to seek the perfection of their given talent in the defense of others. Their duties bring them in touch with a wide variety of combat and survival based talent, including swordplay, tracking, foraging, camping, diplomacy and espionage. A true Sentinel will try and master as much as possible to be a much more talented Sentinel.A Sentinel is restricted to or must adhere to the following:OOC Terms- No offensive PK, or issuing challenges to PK areas in retribution for crimes against the Sentinels or it's allies.- Must Roleplay. This is mandatory. Failure to be in character while taking part in events both minor and major is contrary to the guild's purpose.- Obviously no issues with MUD LAW.IC Terms- Must adhere to all guild and Tirun law.- Must be martially adept. (I.E. A Fighter with a sword, a Rogue trained to fight with knives, a Swashbuckler trained to.. swashbuckle.)- Must be morally aligned.- Must be honourable and have a clean record.A Sentinel's duties are: To protect the land and help to make it grow. But Sentinels don't seek to stand and defend, they seek to go forth and destroy the threat at the source. In times of war, they infiltrate enemy lines to assassinate the commanders of the opposing forces, they risk everything to the odds to meet with diplomats and arrange for peace, they spend every waking moment of their life forming tactics and training to prepare for conflict. During times of peace, it's likely that a Sentinel won't have much to do but train. To make this slightly less boring, they will be putting together tournaments with prizes and accolades given to the winners. Non-Sentinels may be invited if they adhere to the tournament rules. Much of the funding for these semi-annual events will come directly from the coffers of the guild. A portion of proceeds from these events will see their way into construction and improvement of the guild hall and guild projects.Sentinel Duties- Patrol the outlying lands of the realm.- Train and spar with other Sentinels.- Form strike teams with support from Mages and Clergy during times of war.- Instruct others on the terms and tactics of combat.- Research the history of war and conflict.- Form relationships with potential allies and steer enemies towards peace without bloodshed.- Scout out new areas and explore for the prosperity of the guild.- Plan and organize tournaments and events.- Plan the defense of Tirun, including adding to the defensive structure of the town.Sentinels may eventually have a ranking system, depending on how their numbers grow. For the time being, there isn't much need for a structured ranking system.Founding Members:KibethDisclaimer: Even without immortal involvement, or coding.. We can exist. Nothing can prevent that. It's our hopes that we will be recognized as a core component of the realm itself and treated as such, with access to putting together and funding projects for ourselves. We're just likeminded folk trying to band together for a purpose, and hopefully add some life to the realm itself.If there are any questions at all, please refer them to me (Kibeth) and I'll be happy to answer them. "
