__Letter "2 quick onesBoost is still very cheap. 500 mp for boost 120 which is more than enough to boost 700 sp. still too strong for paladin/antipaladinOther is bear form. hermes does 260 on swipe and has 1.7k hp + 4 attacks per round. Thats better than a centaur fighter and he has half the stats"
