__Letter "Blooddrink revisions:	Hi.  I had some ideas to change bloodrink a bit.I thought every player could have a 'retaliate against(target) on/off' which basically determines whether ornot they fight back when attacked by that target.  Thedefault would be on, you could just add/remove peoplefrom a list to not fight.So, from anything to a weak friend getting mad and attackingyou, to allowing a vampire to drink your blood, youcould choose who you let take a chunk out of you andwho you attack.What this does for bloodrink, is we could make it onlyinitiate combat with people who who were retaliating:if you had a human ally, they could allow you to taketheir blood without some brutal combat instakill goingon.  Also, it should still work on corpses, since avampire with 3 BP probably wont be able to take froman unwilling living target.This wouldn't just be good for vampires.  It allowspeople to toy with their fights and show mercy to somepissed off friends...Levi"
