__Letter "I see your going afk alot tonight so ill as you this wayI just wanna know if im understanding how mappings and arrays function within LPC.THey seem similar except that arrays are predefined and use 0-to-x as the index while mappings use the variable to the rightmost location as the index.Also i was peeking at the save file for my trivia game.  Mappings can be nested it seems.x"
