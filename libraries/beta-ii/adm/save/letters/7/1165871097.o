__Letter "hostname: dsmud.game-host.orgYou should be able to ssh in on port 7500login name: daospassword: ub3r t3mp p4ssI have ports 7000 and 7001 forwarded right now for the mud,and 7500 to ssh in with, and 7700 in case you need to ftpfiles in (use passive mode). Would be better to use scp orsftp though.I'll be glad to give you the root pass on that box too, sinceit's not doing anything else, after you're logged into it.I have /var/mud/ ready to go to put the mud in, make sure toset the persmissions like this:chgrp -R mud /var/mud/*chmod -R g+rw /var/mud/*After you dump the mud in.And uh, let me know if you need any help or need me to do something."
