__Letter "After being notified of the server going up and down, I looked into processes and noticed the mail daemon running pretty hard.  It turns out that when the server is rebooted (it was about a month ago), the firewall is reset.  I thought it would save the settings when I ran the save utility.  Anywho.  In the last month or so, it seems as if a spammer had found that our server was now an open relay and was sending lots of mail thru here.  Not much on the bandwith side, but handling all the queues and logging bogged down the server, which is likely why it crashed (log files didnt really show any *real* reason for restart).  I've got the firewall reconfigured and purged the mail queues, so everything should be working well.  If any other problems come up, let me know.  Thanks          -NS"
