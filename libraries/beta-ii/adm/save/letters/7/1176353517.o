__Letter "Master Jamesssss! I'm going to remort ot a thief for this reboot, just wondering what they're looking like and plus Nulvect said something about doing thieves fairly soon. Thief is the only class I've never really played on here, and I was thinking about checking them out a lil' bit. But anyways sir, you take care :)"
