__Letter "Hi, sorry wasn't on, trying to get stuff ready in new place.  Still thingsto do.  I'm using Trevor's computer at his place, until I get my own computerset up.  Everything is pretty much over there, except a few things, sowill come on his computer during the day and stay at new place at night.Have to set up things in my room to get computer where I want it.Hope to talk to you before I head over there.  I'm now arranging for newphone hook-up and I have to be there when they are doing it.  Things arecoming along.  Hope you're okay, miss you tons,Your Rayna"
