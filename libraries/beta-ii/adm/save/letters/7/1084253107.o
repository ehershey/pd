__Letter "I would like to put Kumi up for harassment, not only for myself but for others that have had to put up with her bad mouthing and ridicule.  I know you have seen the log of the events from newbie line in which i made a comment 'yep' to her asking if she 'st..st..stuttered' that was not the first attack of this kind though i don't have logs to state differently.  She not only attacked my character but me personally and brought  in other characters of mine into the conversation.  There has been numerous occassions where someone has spoken on newbie only to be told to shut up.  There have been numerous occasions where newbies have asked questions only to be told off by her.  With most of my character i have newbie turned off because her attitude to others makes me angry and if you say anything you are only putting yourself up for attack, though this hinders in helping any newbies with questions they might have about the game.Thank you for your timeNoodles/Wisp"
