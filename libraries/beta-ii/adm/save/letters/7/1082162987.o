__Letter "I brought up your being an imm with the other imms/admins and everyone seemed pretty keen on the idea.  There's a few things I want you to know ahead of time, though.  If you become an imm, you can pick a new name, but you wont be able to have any player chars while you're an immortal.  We can back a few of them up in the meantime, but they'll be gone while you're an imm.  You'll also have to become a member of the imm guild so that there's no claim to guild favoritism.  I also want to ask you a few questions (I may have asked you these personally, but I will share these with the other admins)1.  Why do you want to become an imm?2.  What is it that you would like to do or what do you plan on doing?3.  How well do you think you can handle players you dont like or dont like you?4.  How would you handle said players?That's all I can think of atm...  We may ask you a few other things before anything happens as well.  If you've got any questions before hand as well, feel free to ask me.  Thanks for volunteering and waiting on us to discuss everything :)                          -Nightshade"
