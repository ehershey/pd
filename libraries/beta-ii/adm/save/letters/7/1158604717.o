__Letter "no see ^.^how you been as of late? I hope that you and Luna are both well.  I was talking to Daos the other day on builders and I have been helping people learn to code a lot over there and I was actually thinking, God I would love to be doing this full time, I love the mud and I love Xping, but I am more of a teacher and a coder than an XPer.  I love being able to help people and I love creating new things.  I would love to be an Immortal on PD and an Admin on Builders.  I know you know this already, and I know I'm probably gettin on your nerves about it, but I have not heard about it in a long time, which is why I'm mudmailing you.Please let me know what you think, I'd be able to start today if you wanted ^.^  I hope that you are all well. and thank you.Carina"
