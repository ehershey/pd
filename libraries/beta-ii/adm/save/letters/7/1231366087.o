__Letter "hi, i've been doing okay, trying to keep busy. I guess there were justtoo many shocks at one time, so I've been keeping low profiled.I do miss you guys and old times, it was fun coming on and yelling Yangon chat.  I miss ya too.  I just come on and off sporadically, lost interest in a lot of stuff rightnow, but coping.  *hugs"
