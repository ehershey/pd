__Letter " Alla that stuffMy love, I don't want to put you out. I don't even want you tothink that I wanted you to help them. That's not what I want. Itried very hard to make sure that 'that person' doesn't botheryou with their issues. I wasn't trying to ask you to come out ofyour comfort zone, but I am sure it seemed that way. When it allcomes down to it, only one person is that important to me and it'syou. :) I've gotta be better at looking out for your concerns andI will be. Please get all the rest you need...and then some!I'll be thinking of you and praying for your health.All my love,Your James"
