__Letter "well, if you go LD before I can respond it makes it kinda difficult.  anyway, mentioning specific things like walking through lava might be a little much.  It is kinda assumed taht you'll have to \"work real hard\" to go through quests, so I dont think mentioning things like that will be a problem.  One thing I would say is to tell people it's being worked on, but I wouldnt say anything about it, because it makes it more of a suprise and fun exploring when people get to see it."
