__Letter "Hey hey. Just wanted to let you know that i've been running across a lot of balance issues at higher levels that are gonna get pretty bad as levels get higher.Main thing tho is stats dont really have any effect right now on gameplay. Well meaningful enough effects that they are worth raising rather than just leveling. Skills alone are way too powreful at making abilities strong which gets magnified at high levels to where you have things that just should not be (lvl 50 raknid ranger of mine slashed for 800 damage with 20s in stats) (I could holyfire people for 900 damage at lvl 50 with 20s in stats). But then stats dont currently do enough to counter a downgrade to skill bases. My wisdom is the only stat that effects my holyfire and it appears 1 wis = 1 point damage. Plus a change in stat/skill ratios of importance would reward people for stating and not just power leveling forever. In my opinion it would be better balanced that way. As it was my lvl 50 could kill just about anyone even tho his stats never were above 40. Purely because of the skill levels. Even now my stats arent very good but i kill faster and am harder to kill that any other player. Once again its purely skill basedLevels alone add the equivalent of 1 con/wis/dex and then the skill additions on top of that. And levels are very cheap up until around lvl 63 or so.Also there are many abilities out there that throw balance out of the game at high levels with the way they are right now.I been putting a lot of thought and testing into this lately and if you'll give me the chance i think i could re-do our current spells/abilities to be in better balance for all levels and sizes of people. Quick exampleMy holyfire right now does 1.2k damage if i max skills. Now holyfire has a few serious drawbacks i wont go into, but all in all i can do 1.2k damage for 200 mp to everything in the room... which is nuts. Its almost purely faith based as far as i can tell. Here's how i would rework itHolyfire damage =  Faith skill + (3 x wis) - (Opponents int x 3).This would downgrade overall damage (nessissary... i make 20 mil an hour since lvl 50). Would place importance on stats in addition to skills. And would require people to raise stats to defend not md (which not everyone gets).MD i feal should be brought way down in importance btw and wis shoudl be brought up in magic resistance. But i can change all that and make forumulas for you to check if you wantAnyways just hopeing that you'll give me a chance to test all this and try and work it out for you. I dunno if this is possible on builders or not, but i would need to be able to change my class/levels/skills so i could test out abilities vs certain things.I know the player side of this mud better than anyone else and i think i could do a great job of balancing things a little bit more to free up your time for other things.Wow! I ramble...KK thx -- Ash"
