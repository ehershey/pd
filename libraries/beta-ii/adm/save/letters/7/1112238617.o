__Letter "i read sam's post on illum board, something about centaur claddings? if you can tell me what they are and if they can't be found anywhere else in the game at all, i will make them available to the world.on that note, any other armor which is not available at all to anyone (i mean everyone not just 'forsaken have it and we don't) and its a piece of armor missing from a centaur, raknid, whatever, let me know."
