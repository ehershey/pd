__Letter "I have another project that i was working on for Homelandbefore it got scrapped. This project pertained to containers.What I have in mind is designed to reduce the amount of memorythe mud must use to track objects.What my system does is takes an object that is being placedinside of another container/weapon/armour and treats it in thefollowing manner;       1) When the object is placed into the container, the          name, encumberance, filename, object_class, and          short_describe are all stored into a mapping contained          in the container.       2) Due to the fact that the system only needs to trace          one container instead of the container and ALL it's          deep_inventory_list, the system is regaining alot          of memory.       3) Once the information from the object being stored is          stored, The object is removed.       4) When the object is removed from the container, it is          reloaded into the mud.       5) The mapping would retain the records of how many of          an item are \"in existance\" with a daemon i would be          writting.================================================================As an added bonus of this system, I would be designing weaponsthat can hold ammunitions. Examples of this would be basicfirearms like a musket or mussleloading pistol for pirates.I dont think we would want advanced firearms but basic oneswould fit in. It will also allow us to have wands and stavesthat would store \"crystals\" to fuel more advanced spells.In other words, It would give another tool for Nulvect whenhe's designing new commands. He can base some spells uponweapondry that containes \"ammunition\" for the spells.===============================================================Please mail me back if this idea interests you. If you want it,I will get to work on it right after the senses system isperfected.If it doesn't interest you, mail me and i'll scrap this idea.Ironman"
