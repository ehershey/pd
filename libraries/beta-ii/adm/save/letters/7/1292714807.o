__Letter "If you are committed to the decision, sure I would be fine taking over. Are you still going to be leading with me or are you wanting to go down to council or the second rank?Also, as I don't really use Kilir all that much, and Abraxas is going to be pretty strong soon, you mind if I switch leadership with him? "
