__Letter "Player Killing From a Different Standpoint.So, the question remains what do you get out of killing another player?   There are some who just do it for the exhileration rush.  For others, they need to work out guild matters, or player difference, and this is one way.  A slight few kill just to prove it can be done.On to the arena, it's there for players who want to battle each other.  You don't get to loot a corpse, no loss of levels, so what's the point?  If you're going after someone, the idea is to make them hurt as much as possible.  The best way is outside of the arena."
