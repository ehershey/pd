__Letter "The Sand-Orc Invasion:Area: Desert west of town, Muabark i think. It was coded by dab.Mobs: Ancient middle-east type weapons and armour, like falchions, hammers, tridents/halberds, and crossbows.A kingdom of orcs have migrated to the Muabark desert. They are known as the sand-orcs, and they come from a far away continent. Nobody knows why they have chosen tirun as their new homeland, but they are determined and have built fortress deep in the desert. The orcs are ruthless and don't take kind to invaders. Find out why they have chosen tirun, and if necessary, dispose of them."
