__Letter "Ok, now you are into petty revenge. This has got to stop. He said nothing to you. The pit is there to put things in, and I know for a FACT he heard nothing you said and the meat in the pit thing was not aimed at you. You were not the only one talking in the []. Maybe he did do it to aggrivate you but who cares. He did not speak to you, touch you, poke you, or do anything else to you. Don't be so petty. If this mail upsets you I apologize but I have other things to do than police your imigined harassment when I can see nothing pointed specifically at you.I hate to be this way. I really do but this has gone on long enough and I am done with hearing about it, unless he says or does something directly to you, do not send me more mails about it. Put him on your ignore list, this is not a request and ignore anything and everything he does. He will not bother you if you do not let him. After all, it is just a game made for everyones enjoyment. Even his.If he bothers you directly, ie: says something to you or about you, I will banish him from PD for good. As long as he is not goaded into it by you or another player that is...Stormy"
