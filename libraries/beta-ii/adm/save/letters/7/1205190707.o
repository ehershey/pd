__Letter "I know you enjoy the new spell you've made. But it's about as useful as being able to summon demons or minions as a necro. Who actually does it? yes, it may add some depth if there were actual people who RPed in the realm instead of doing purely dmg based everything. Im just getting tired of the constant rotational revamp, because everytime something is.. it's the new strongest thing, instead of making classes balanced. And don't give me what they used to say allt he time, balance is a difficult thing. Because, Ive seen alot of muds with balance between classes. And dont downgrade antis.. I dunno, it seems like it takes shorter and shorter time for a sobatical from this mud to make me want another one"
