__Letter "Hey baby, I'm not going to be on for the rest of the night, I'm bored and I don't want to be in the computer room the whole time my friend is here. I'm going to be on tomorrow reguardless if it's my B-day or not. I miss you already and I can't wait to talk to you again. I wish you could be here to celebrate my b-day with me but it's alright, it'll happen soon enough. I hope you do good on your tests and have a good day tomorrow. I love you lots and have sweet dreams.Josh"
