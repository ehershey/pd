__Letter "I don't know if it was you that reinserted this test into _ed.c command.Do NOT use that directly in the commands anymore. Use the following tests;master()->valid_read()            master()->valid_write()I have repaired the master.c object so that it tests BuildSecure.c ,access.db , and security_screen.c files. If you want to use a direct accesstest, Use those contained in /adm/simul_efun/security_screen.c file.These control the access to most of the files now.Ironman"
