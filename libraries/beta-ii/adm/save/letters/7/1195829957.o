__Letter "I thought i should mail you folks and give you the steps neededto install my system.    1) Inherit /std/obj/iron_sense.c into /std/Object.c    2) Remove /std/room/senses.c from /std/room.c    3) Remove the \"Object.c\"->cmd_read() and the add_action for       the read command.    4) Alter the \"user.c\"->describe_current_room() to query my       system for the default sound and smell installed on the       room.    5) Alter the /std/room/items.c for the following;       a) int set_items(my_map){ return set_all_details( my_map );}       a) mixed query_items(target){ return query_details( target );}       c) This will seemlessly convert the old system over to mine.          It's not required tho since the old items and my details          work seemlessly together. It's just redundent. You can          leave them if you wish for reverse-compatability. These          changes will allow for that as well.     6) Load the commands contained in /cmds/iron_senses where        people can get them. You can also alter the         \"user.c\"->init_search_path() to add the whole directory.        If you add the search_path, You would need to alter the        _help.c so that it can locate the help files for the new        commands.==================================================================The rest of the implimentation will take care of itself due to theinheritance chain. It will cascade thru the entire mudlib cause itis inherited by Object.c and most of the other objects inherit theOBJECT inherit. The only one that i seen that doesnt is bag_logic.cTherefore, inherit my file into bag_logic.c as well if we want bagsto have the sensory info as well.==================================================================Just mail me back if/when you want this implemented on buildersand i can have it in place in a matter of minutes for that port.I would like to sit down with stormbringer and/or whit to go overthe final syntaxes for the commands before the system is adopted.I want the builders to be using the proper syntaxes.=================================================================IronmanPS -- Once this is in place, Cortoth and I will be recruiting      heavily for PD and for builders. My area got put on hold      waiting on this too. After all, It was designed with my      Tirun Reef area in mind :PPPS - Please mail me back with a time and date we can meet on      builders to talk it over."
