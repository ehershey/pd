__Letter "Stormy,Daos has given me ownership of Unholy back, and both Set and Bellos willingly handed it over.  I'm glad it worked out this way.After my exams, around Christmas time, I'll be writing a lot of descriptions for the area that Daos and I are planning to do.  I want to do a proposal write-up for you to look at too.  It's basically planned as being Daos' home dimension, which he destroyed and left in ruins before he came here.  It would be full of a tortured people.Another thing, I was wondering if someone has picked up the project of vampires.  If not, I can incorporate them into the new area.  Thanks.  Levi"
