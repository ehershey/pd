__Letter "Alright.  Well, I thought the meeting we had yesterday went pretty well.  Apparently I was mistaken.  Just to clarify, things to do with this drama don't need to be brought up any more.  I'll admit, not discussing it isnt the best way to resolve anything, but there's enough drama on this mud to deal with.  I dont need it from the imms.  It hasnt been like this since kumi left, and I was starting to actually enjoy hanging out on PD again.  I'll be really blunt.  If anyone cant manage to let it go, you can leave.  It's that simple.  I'm really tired of it.  Now, you may not really be involved that much, and then that's fine.  I just want anyone even partially involved to know where I stand.  I know it's fully possible to go on and be just fine, even if things are not going well with you.  Most of you probably dont know that I work 11 hours a day, come home and eat raisins and some juice to save money so I dont end up on the street, then try to talk to my pregnant girlfriend who's about to break up with me after getting a letter from my insurance that the people I was in an accident last year have used up 25 thousand dollars and I have to pay for anything else.  So yeah, I've got my own drama, I dont want any more.  For those of you who have taken the mature route, I appreciate your help in letting this die out.  For everyone else...  let this be the end of it.                   -Nightshade"
