I'm thinking there's going to be an influx of hate mail.Then, all of these people went inactive again, when the reboot msgs started. Except they started counting at 10 and went 9 and 8 in about 3 seconds. In this time, everyone in the list above got disconnected.Continually people were being disconnected as the reboot counted down, and Tchon claims to have died due to this spontaneous disconnecting. If you could look into it, i think he may want some xp back for it.So far, he's the only person claiming to have died. He thinks he lost about 5-6 mil xp, but yeah.Everyone was a bit pissed off, but they calmed down soon after everything else did. I really wished i could've done more at that point, but there was not much to do.Thats all. Thanks for your time.Helena"
