__Letter "well, dearest.. tonight is the first of a few that i will be spending in absence of your company. I miss you terribly.. in fact, i'm not going to stay online much longer at all. I find myself sitting and waiting around, hoping you'll show up. But i know you won't.. at least, not tonight. at any rate. I went out to the airport with my dad today, and saw 2 very amazing WWII planes. a B-24 named \"Diamond Lil\", and a B-29 named \"Fifi\". the B29 is the type of plane that dropped the bomb on Japan. oi. it was quite something to walk inside of it.. *laughs* i was walking around the wing, and looking at engine #3.. and saw, to my suprise, that it had been repaired in OK. guess who i thought of RIGHT AWAY?? you. you, driving to OK, and how much i wished you could have been there, seeing those planes with me.. how much i care for you, enjoy talking to you, etc. etc. *sighs* i miss you. so much. one night, and my heart is aching so badly... *hug* it will just make me look forward to the evening of the 29th more. *smile*well, i've got to get to bed.. things to do, places to go.. and thoughts to think. (mostly of you.) *kisses you softly* *waves* i'll call you on the 29th. i MIGHT get a chance to check email, so if you get this.. its worth a shot. Ciao, Paul."
