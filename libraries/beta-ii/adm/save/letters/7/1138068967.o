__Letter "I am telling you both, levi and azire, to completly ignore carina. If she actually breaks a rule, or cheats ro something like that, let me know. I don't want either of you directly, or indirectly talking to her in any way. No tells with her, and don't engage her on any of the lines. If you have a problem, send it on up to an admin, like me. If you have to, put her on ignore for the rest of your life. I just don't want to see any more blow-ups from either person.Daboura"
