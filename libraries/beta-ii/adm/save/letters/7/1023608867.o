__Letter "From your posts on the Ranger board I realise that it will take time to code the moves for us Rangers so I came up with the idea. I have a builder on Bport and so far all I know is how to do rooms and monsters and I would like to learn how to code moves for classes. Anyway to get to the point I would be willing to code moves for Rangers if someone where to teach me how to. That's it please think this over."
