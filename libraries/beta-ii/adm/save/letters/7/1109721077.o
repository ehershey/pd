__Letter "While other currencies are acceptable, a flick of a platinum from a level 36 jester to me, did 362 damage.  They said it cost 90 sp.It seems a bit unbalanced, seeing that 1 platinum is only 10 gold, which makes it easily a lot cheaper than firebomb and other such things, and also highly damaging for not much gold."
