__Letter "there is more then just my tells that we are all having problems with levi but this is all i can give you people are getting arrested for what is being said on guild lines when Dab told all admins and imms to stay off guild lines and i was told that guild lines were a private line for guilds but here are the tells... Levi tells you:I think you owe me an apology for that mudmail you sent me. You reply to Levi: as soon as you apologize to Carina for not stopping the harrassment that was happening then i don't feel like i need to when a player comes to an imm or admin about a problem action should be take expecially when they are unidle Levi tells you:Suit yourself.  But as for your mention of the possibility that you may snap/flip out on the next person who you arbitrarily decide is the aggressor in a verbal conflict, be aware that I'll hold you equally responsible.  \"I was dragged into it\" is not a valid excuse for breaking one of my rules.sorry i know this is all ran together i hope you can read this but he had the whole mud in an uproar over arresting peopleif i can get more people to send you what he did i will have them mail it to you but it's getting out of control he said i have insulted him before yeah maybe by my mud mail to him and i sent it to everyone i could think of so everyone knew what was going on and that i would get dested for what was said that is the only reason i mail that mud mailwish you were here more to see this stuff but i don't want to see this mud go down because of him being a dictator and i fully understand that you have a real life so do many of us but many of us thinks he is abusing his powers of being an immortal.hope to hear back from you soon take care stormyFuriae"
