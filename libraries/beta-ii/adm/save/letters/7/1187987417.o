__Letter "wow, i can't remember, i lost all of my stuff the time before this and tried to get all of it back.  I kept getting pieces here and there, the onlything I really want back is my - Diamond - pleaseThe other stuff I can figure out later.  Since I lost all my valuable stuffthe first time, I don't even know what it was and all I ask is for myDiamond back.  I didn't think to keep an inventory list from the firsttime so all my awesome stuff is gone!Just my diamond please :) Thank you"
