__Letter "  Ok bum... I want some cash for this, I spent 120K on it... so the more you could re-emburse me the better, but if not, It's all good I guess. Anyways, sign onto dagmar and take the \"holy battle armour\" from the guild locker, drop it, sign off, then back on as Hermes and take it. It's supposedly pretty decent. You have to ask stormy or an admin to make it fit you, it's set for raknid right now, but they custom make it to fit you. So... yea. Good luck.  I'm level 40 still, 70 str. 65 Dex. I've never had that much Strength before, so go me. Catch up, I wanna level and train more skills. Chow.Cookie"
