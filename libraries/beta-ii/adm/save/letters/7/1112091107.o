__Letter "Hey man I was thinkin tonight so I figured i'd go ahead and ask ya. I dont know about you but I think it would be cool if someone were to make a bard and get him really buff, and find a way to make them good. Well I think I found a way to make them good. I was wondering if there was any was possible you could change mazrims class/subclass to wanderer bard. Stormy said that it is up to you in that department. I know you guys hate to change people classes, but I dont think anyone would complain seeing as how mazrim is so old and I never play him anymore cuz i'm really not interested in playing a rogue anymore. Having a really active demon bard that actually exp's enough to get buff and start whoopin people assses would be good for pd. I wanna prove that it isnt just the strength of the class but how you play it.please please please, I mean, i'm askin to be made into a bard here :Pthanks, Justin-/Mazrim/Dubbya/Agent/Logaine!"
