__Letter "Dubbya - One look at this Demon and you fear for your life.  With horns a footlong and half a foot thick, he glares at you with his dark crimson eyes.  Asyou continue to stare in awe at him, he stands; allowing his black leatherywings to unfurl, blocking out the sun from their length and darkness; and youwish you could look away.  He is armed to the teeth and clad in full body armorwhich is covered in thick, black ooze. He wears a dark sash around his massivechest marking him as one of the Forsaken. His massive arms ripple and his armorshifts slightly as his chest grows even bigger in front of you. Despite themultitude of things to be amazed by, you can't take your eyes away from hismask.  You notice the blood dripping from it, down to his blackened chest anddown to his belt.  One look at this belt and you vomit.  The blood that isdripping onto it is what gives the heads on his belt their fiery eyes.  Youtake a closer look and notice that the heads are moving, as if they are stillbeing tortured by the demon in the afterlife. His eyes are filled with a sortof masochistic insanity, and seem to pierce your very soul. You feel as if youhave stared too long at him for his amulet has started to leak a black smokewhich begins to surround this Forsaken Demon.  You feel like you have littletime left to live in his presence so you cower away.                           Dubbya has these heads on his belt: Tauran, Metholis, Necrite, Set, Piehl,Scourge, Rueznor, Smokey and a few others too decayed to distinguish."
