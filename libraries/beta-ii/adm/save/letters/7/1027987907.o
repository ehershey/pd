__Letter "         Skill/Stat/Class/EXP systemThe player never sees experience as a number.  Nor is it saved up to be spent on something later.  EXP will be used only towards stats.  It will be applied to 'tagged' stats, that can be tagged on or off at any time.  If more than one stat is tagged, the exp is divided evenly amongst those stats.Skills will be raised only by the use of the abilities it applies to.  For example:  Fighting will raise swordplay, defense, etc.Classes will be determined by what stats you \"spec\" in.  You will choose a few stats at creation to specialize in, and having specialties in different stats will give you special skills.  For instance, specializing in dexterity and coordination could give you the thieving skill in addition to the base skills everyone gets.Levels will automatically increase according to the total amount of skill points you have.  Skill points will be limited by it's corresponding stat.  For example.  If you have only 10 strength, your melee skill will have a max of 10 (or a number determined from strength)."
