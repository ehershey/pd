__Letter "Sorry about leaving the guild, I havent been feeling good lately. Im not sick its just depression issues and i do not think its best for me to be on council or even be in a guild at the moment, because of my problems. Sorry for the inconvenience, but i really do not feel like doing anything at all and that isnt good for the guild. Tell the rest of the guys im sorry. I dunno how much ill be playing, i will probably be on most of the time but not really active in that time.thnx~Zubaida"
