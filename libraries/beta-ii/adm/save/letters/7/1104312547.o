__Letter "I see you're still off, I'll try and stay on if I can. This isn't anything you've done.I met with Trev for a short while and told him basically what you said about yourmum and friends re: the net. He said women had more to be worried about onthe net and wanted  me to be safe and had told me before I went on SM to becareful what I gave out. He also said that's why he wanted to go with me.He thinks everyone should back off and leave us alone and stop putting ideasinto our heads. He's a little annoyed and said he'd talk to me more aboutgoing tomorrow, so it's best that I leave him alone until then. I don't want todo anything more to upset him or he might not help me.Grrrr. talk to ya soonRay :("
