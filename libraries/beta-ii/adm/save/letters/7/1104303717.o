__Letter "Just as finished last message, Trev wants to meet now, he's going out to movielater so I'm foregoing dinner for now. I'll be back afterwards then.I'm sorry, I suppose I had wished that we hadn't discussed our family'sconcerns because I'm worried now I won't meet up to your Mum's expectationsor something. Trev did tell me that from the tone of his voice that he wishedpeople had stayed out of our business and not put ideas in our heads - myfriends included. I think he's a bit p****ed off about it. He is willing to go withme there, not because of disbelief, but because of something he said hewanted to do for me. So, I'll see ya when I get back on. I think he's right too, in that I never had doubts, and Trev said why do peoplehave to ruin things (he was meaning SM too).Talk to you in a bit.:("
