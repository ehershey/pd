__Letter "There has been a few times now where players have come to me with problems and they have problems explaining it to me.  Is it possible for me to be able to snoop players?  It would make it so much easier.  Tonight I had to try to fix something the the treasury in LS but i couldn't see what was happening...anyway let me know please, thanks!"
