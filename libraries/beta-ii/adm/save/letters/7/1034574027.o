__Letter "Other random balance:Dust/spheres on new island are bugged. Plus all rooms are set as indoors.Acidcone: This spell is insane. Area attack at lvl 25 that insta-killed an 11k mob. Random but still very overpoweredBuffer: I get low md but i can buffer myself over and over till i dont take damage or at least very little. if someone had 4 or 5 md per level they would be untouchable. with my 66 md i can easily hellfire the tenebrae throne room and take only 50-100 damage per round. I'd recommend making it last a shorter period of time so its still useful but you would have to spend more time recasting it if you want a ton of buffer. Perhaps 1/2 the current time would be about right.Might want to check that war scepter item. Seems like it could be insane from what the mob did to me with it...My boost doesnt seem to take as much mp as it should. I do boost 120 and lose only 200 mp or so. This is also true of other classes i believe which makes paladins/antipaladins insane. Since my massacre only does about 100 damage i dont use it much so i havent see how much this low mp boost throws off balance. but in theory i could make an insane raknid paladin or antipaladin. slash to negative sp and single boost for 200 mp and your back at full sp.Static shield puts me fully armoured all over. seems a little strong. Thats about all that i've noticed lately. I'll let you know as i find more-- Rubi"
