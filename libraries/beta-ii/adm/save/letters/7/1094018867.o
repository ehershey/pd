__Letter "Well a full report from the staff online (daos and Venenum) venenum who i am not in his good books. Ok, what happened was... i was online at a friends house with an ALT named \"Msyoung\" and my friend came online because he saw me playing. he didn't tell me so i had no idea until daos was said something and i looked at his screen.. so i applied for a LAN and told daos... he said that was ok.. then venenum came along and said my name was inappropriate.. so i suicided the character and made a charactered called \"Soad\" for jokes... it is daos backwards.. and i just picked my race and i got teleported to venenum's prison and i applied for the lan then he said i too stop playing around.. so i suicided \"Soad\" and made the character called Silvan. as soon as i came on he teleported me to his prison... i applied for the lan and he said i have already broken the multiplaying rule 3 times... one for each alt... i did not know that if you suicide the character that it takes away that you applied.At that point my mum came to pick me up and i had to go home.. as soon as i got home i came on pd as Silvan so i could play with my friends... but they weren't on so i said ohwell and brang galdur on.. then i came on tuesday(my bday irl) and i find galdur had been dested for multiplaying.that is my side of the story.	Galdur"
