__Letter "Ya bear is kinda nuts. 150 attack + melee + 100 defense + 500 life and then you have your base MD and you can vinearmour before the morph. Pretty much its unkillable and you do a very very large ammount of damage from melee round (4 hits per round) and swipe. Its roughly the equivalant of being a 2 armed fighter with 80s for stats (he hits as hard as i did as a fighter of that size) but with more life and better defense. Hermes' has crap for stats too.   1 on 1 he can outlast me in arena as a bear. Only other person who can do that is gabriel. Galdur, daboura, cookie, boffa, lac, aldur, seth do less damage and dont last even close to as long..  Bear form is a bit nuts. not too bad but just a little bit.Stasis. I still say this spell is the ultimate in PK cheese. Stasis someone while they fight a hard mob. Stasis someone after a fighter attacks them. 2 eazy cheap pks. I could bring a level 20 and stasis prator in forbidden forest and he'd be toast.  If you could not use abilities/spell but could still leave the room it would be better."
