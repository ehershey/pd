__Letter "Heh, i know about the demons and angels, and if unholy wants to pk angels in our guild, then let it be, but right now there are no demons in unholy and angels in darksoul is cool with me. I don't mind. I made it clear that i will not be pk'ing guild members, no matter the reason, including angels. And if a demon announces on the demon line that he's comming after an angel in our guild, i will not be saying anything. Thats how it is. but if a demon kills an angel in the guild, i won't be getting retribution *maybe*"
