__Letter "Just so you really understand what im trying to get acrosshere.. Not to be mean or anything dont get me wrong, i justwant to see balance.Heres an example, Lets say me and Paranoia reverse rolesParanoia has 100 str, 70 dexand All the skills i had, 195 attack, 180 bladeAnd I the inferior class *kataan*have 10 strength, And 20 dexNow, We go into the arena, And he slashes me..What would happen to me?, Would he deal out 265 damage?Hell no, he would deal out a lot moreProbably insta-kill me aswell!Maybe even sever something :PTheres an example of the balance between fighters and magicusers.And even worse, To consider that Demonfire is my MOSTpowerful spell, Takes a round (where slash is instant)and ALL my other spells are weaker still!Whereas a fighter whirl with 100 strength, and 70 dexwould probably sever me in halfAnd a fighter jab would probably knock my head off.So really, Please dont get me wrong but that is TOTALimbalance.Set - Blah"
