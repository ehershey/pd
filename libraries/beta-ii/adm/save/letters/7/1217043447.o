__Letter "Doors are broken right now -- you are unable to unlock or lock any door.I know you may not have enough time to look through all my stuff in /wizards/pyro/fixes right now, but I would appreciate it if you could quickly look at /wizards/pyro/fixes/{_unlock, _lock, vault}.{c, readme} when you have time. The are not bugless -- when you type <open [fakeobject] with [realkey]> it does not print an error message telling you that there is no fakeobject. All the other errors are gone though, including the error we were trying to fix before as well as the current error of being unable to lock and unlock doors."
