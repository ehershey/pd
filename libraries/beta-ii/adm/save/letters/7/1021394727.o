__Letter "Spells and abilities are stormbringers domain, he dosent want other people messing with them unless he asks you do alter them. its hard for him to know whats been altered so he can adjust things for balance. He also wants to be the only one to work on spells and abilities so he can keep it under control.Thats probably why he got so mad at you for doing that. so dont touch spells or abilities  without his say so.Thanks"
