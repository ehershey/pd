__Letter "Arright, good news man. You've been interested thus far, so I thought I'd keep you up to date. Today, about 3, I was woken up by a call from Sonic asking me to come in for an interview at 2:30 tomorrow.. so good shit there.Then a couple minutes later Rachel called Applewoods, and they want both of us to come in for an interview at 3:00 tomorrow, and the manager, she says, had our apps infront of them at the time and they sounded glad to hear back from us.I'm gettin' offa here now, just thought I'd tell ya this. I'll be on later to xp and shit.. Rachel says \"hi\" and \"wish us good luck\". In case we don't hear from you again, man, have a safe trip down here. Can't wait to see ya again.John and Rachel"
