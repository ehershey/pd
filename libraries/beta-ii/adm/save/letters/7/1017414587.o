__Letter "Paul, Look, this has gotta be fixed. Every time someone saves and logs off, you loose ALL you %'s in your skills! I went from many skill %'s in the high 80's, and all of them drop to 0% when you log back on. This EATS major xp, not to mention is really annoying. Anyways, back to class.l"
