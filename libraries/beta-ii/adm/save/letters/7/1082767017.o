__Letter "<snugs> I'll be sad to see you go of course, but you have to do what you have to do. :) I'm hoping you'll come back after your Japan trip, but hey... that's life, isn't it? :) I'm definately interested in keeping in contact, by phone or whatever, but we'll see. I might be able to arrange cheap calls to Japan or something, or even visit myself for a bit. ^_^ Who knows?"
