__Letter "Wraith is being an absolutely asshole lately. He always whines on darksoul lines about how others think he favors us so he cant act like that. Well he's completely unfair to all of us. After the lucifer incident on the line today me and SC were complaining to each other. Wraith gets on and is saying how he doesnt have to put up with this. well he can jsut turn the damn line off. Its our guild line and we have every right to complain seeing as lucifer broke a ton of rules today. Then wraith says on the line he should rid SC. what the hell for? What did she do? Dont look at everything lucifer did... lets just punish some more darksouls. Poinsoneddwarf is talking shit to SC on newbie. So she tells him to put his penis back in his pants. Wraith gags her. I say on darksoul wtf for? penis? so he gags me.Can something be done about wraith? He is way too power happy and needs to feal important. To make it all worse he is completely unfair about how he punishes people as is obvious after today. Please talk to him or get rid of him or at least something.-- Ash"
