__Letter "Sir, I have come up with kind of an advanced story from what I told you yesterday.Here it is.\"Might I ash thou where i might be?\" ,said the creature. \"Madam, you art in the fair land of Tirun,\" answered Rejik. \"Whom may I ask art thou Madam?\" \"I am Buffy, follower of The lord Asmodeus. I have come to your land called Tirun in search of finding other believers in Asmodeus.\" \"Sir Rejik, who might I ask are you a follower of? asked Buffy. \"Madam\", answered Rejik, I pay legence only to myself\". When Buffy heard this a sly grin came over her face. The in one quick motion Buffy wielded her war spear and stabbed Rejik. Laughing as the spear peirced through his body. \"For those who do not pay legence to my lord, said Buffy I shall surly kill them\". This is where my journey began.Buffy"
