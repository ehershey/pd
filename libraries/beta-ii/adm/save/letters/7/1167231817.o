__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Ironman to Ironman Tue Dec 26 11:41:00 2006:-----There are times that i MUST post on the Tirun board.Alot of builders do not use the same name for their builderas their main character on this port. I therefore have noway of knowing to WHOM to send the mail to. My only recourseis to post on the Tirun board where i know they will see it.The system in place on builders has had several, quite severe,alterations done to it. I will be posting this on the board soany and all persons with a builder (or wish TO build) can usethe new system.If an administrator here on the main port does not wish thispost to be there, they may remove it. I do asked if it is removedthat Daos and I be given a board in a room one south of the tirunboard just FOR builder related topics.Ironman"
