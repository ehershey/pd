__Letter "Aye we did agree, but thought about it deep and hard. I thought... \"Why have him in here if I cant get along with him\" which has been true for the last 5 years. I've tried to, but it doesn't work in the end. He didn't do anything really to get booted, I just didn't want to see him in DS. I didn't see much potential while he was in here he just Idled, and thats about it. "
