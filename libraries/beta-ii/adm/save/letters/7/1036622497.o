__Letter "side 3: Now I'm torn differently. We argued so much. All I wanted was you to reassure me that you did, in fact, love me. That you weren't just saying it for my own benefit. I know. It was wrong of me, but I couldn't just out-right ask you. I worry so much. I worry that something physical will happen if I ever meet you and then I'll never see you again. I worry that I'll never talk to you again. It all just terrifies me.Side 4: I don't know what to do. I've pissed you off and you seem so content without me. What right do I have to pursue you? Why pursue something in vain? Why embarass and humble myself by loving you when you're content without me? What purpose can serve in that? My logic tells me to just leave you alone and get over you. It's been less than a month, I should never have developed these feelings anyways.Side 5: This is the side that causes so much trouble. I always want to talk to you. I want to meet you. I want to be vunerable with you. It's been less than a month and I'm in deeper than I should ever have been. I feel psycho because I want to love and be loved by you so badly. I know I shouldn't.. but I can't help it. That night when I told you I loved you, something in my sparked. It was something I had not felt in a LONG time. Don't know how to describe it, it jsut happened. Was it too soon to tell you that? Most definately yes. Was it too soon for me to feel that way? Probably, but it's cone and I can't go back. Deep within me I want to love yuo. I want this relationship to work, even if that means I can only have you as a friend. I don't want to lose you in my life.This is why I'm torn and confused. This is my mindset(most of it). These are my motivations and feelings. I've opened myself and told you everything I can think to tell you. Now it's up to you. You have everthing I feel/think so you can descide what you want to do with this information and where you want this to go. No matter what you descide.. I'll respect it. Just let me know when you're ready to talk to me. I want to talk to you.. about anything.. I just want to hear your voice again. I think my calling card will work so I wanted to see if I could call you, maybe. Just let me know.Yours Truly,HeatherP.S. My cell number is 803 960 1513"
