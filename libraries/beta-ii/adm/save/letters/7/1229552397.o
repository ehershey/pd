__Letter "Hi, I got your email and right now, I don't know which way is up. I can't face anyone right now. I know I haven't been fair to you andI have been trying to figure things out. I was trying to work out things through Paul but was gettingnowhere really. I have a lot of issues left with Josh and Nickand he doesn't think it's fair that I keep you hanging on.I did want something with you.My Dad was rushed to hospital and he passed away Tuesdaymorning. That was the family problems I was having.I haven't stopped crying and I don't know how I'll get throughthis.  I wasn't coming on here ever again, and now I havehurt you more by making you wait.It's not fair of me to ask that of you.I am so sorry. I will be deleting all of my characters on here, thereis nothing left I can do.  I will cc Yang, because he was aspecial person on here for me too.Know that I will always think of you, and I am sorry for allthat happened.Love always, Rayna"
