__Letter "Leviathas tells you:I've heard that some very powerful good and evil spiritsare going to begin crafting weapons to vanquish the demons and angels if theydon't participate in this war.Leviathas tells you:They seemed to be dissapointed that the demons and angelsbasically made contracts promissing war for power and didn't make good...You reply to Leviathas: hmmmmYou reply to Leviathas: I havent heard anything of the like, and I know thatmost angels are out to kill demons, and Artanis is making his own guildLeviathas replies: ThatLeviathas replies: is because it was only said an hour or two ago.You reply to Leviathas: what was said?You reply to Leviathas: bout artanis makin his own guild?Leviathas replies: Artanis and Aziraphale wont PVP because they are friends andFaust and Soulfly wont be killing because they're also friends.Leviathas replies: About the powerful weapons being made to slay them all.You reply to Leviathas: faust and soulfl wont kill because I ordered them notto, besides soulfly is a rogue angel, he is an evil angelLeviathas replies: demons answer to no one but asmodeus and themselvesLeviathas replies: see, that is why these 'spirits' are angry.  to the good,soulfly is abusing a gift given to him.  to the bad, artanis is too.You reply to Leviathas: artanis is a knockoff, soulfly is willing to kill anydemon except faustLeviathas replies: But that's exactly it.  Mortals have aquired theseconsiderably higher powers promising to do the bidding of the side they joined.They instead pick and choose who they want to die.Leviathas replies: It was a good idea.  Get more powerful and not worry aboutthe consequences.  But apparently, there are some heavy consequences.You reply to Leviathas: faust says he isnt killin cause his backstab is tooweakYou reply to Leviathas: lemmie talk to him and find outLeviathas replies: You're missing the point and I've explained it to you asbest I can.  I consider Faust a 'friend' too.You reply to Leviathas: who is going to wield these weaponsLeviathas replies: They'll probably be available to everyone.You reply to Leviathas: hmmmLeviathas tells you:I'm not saying I agree with their decision, not that Idon't, I'm just not saying anything right now other than some very powerfulbeings have been tricked and they're furious.You reply to Leviathas: lmao, how the hell were they tricked?Leviathas tells you: Becoming a demon or an angel is making a statement thatsays you are going to use your power to follow exactly the will of whoever gaveyou that power.You reply to Leviathas: hmmmm, artanis knows this and who is to say who pkswho, if they miss an angel or demon, so be itYou reply to Leviathas: maybe they leave a very few ppl off their pk listsLeviathas replies: You're free to not PK but why pick a PvP-based race?You reply to Leviathas: a what?Leviathas replies: pvp = player vs playerYou reply to Leviathas: I understand that, and pvp races are demons and angels?Leviathas replies: You can't get pay without doing the work and if you do it'susually called stealing.Leviathas replies: yes they areYou reply to Leviathas: so why not have the 'spirits' make it so that wheneveran angel and a demon meet they automatically start to fight with no chance of apeace spell?Leviathas replies: Because killing another powerful being sometimes takes skillinstead of brute force.Leviathas replies: For example, the demon who backstabs takes down the angelwho doesn't auto attack it.You reply to Leviathas: hmmm well have you thought about why some of them arentkilling each other BESIDES they might be friends?Leviathas replies: no, since it's clear they aren't for that purpose alone... and some are cowards.You reply to Leviathas: most of these angels and demons are freshly minted, lowlvls and wimpy attacksYou reply to Leviathas: is there a pk flag on players pking demons and angels?Leviathas replies: There's no debate to be had.  They better put on a good showor they're toast.Leviathas replies: probablyLeviathas replies: you should need citizenship in a kingdom to be protected byit's lawYou reply to Leviathas: hmmmm get them to make it so there isnt a pk flag tokill an angel or demon and I will weed out the cowards and stupid pplYou reply to Leviathas: since angels and demons are above mortal law, mortalsshould be able to kill them willy nillyLeviathas replies: I can't get them to do anything.  I just heard this.  Ifthey knew I was there I probably wouldn't have left alive.You reply to Leviathas: can you tell me who these spirits are?Leviathas replies: then again, angels and demons shouldnt be on earth much,they need an other world.Leviathas replies: I didn't catch their names.  They were clad in white andblack, typically.Leviathas replies: I didn't consider coming out and asking them, since Ifavored my head on my neck.You reply to Leviathas: well i DONT favor my head on my neck, where are these'spirits'Leviathas replies: They're horribly powerful.  Think about it.  If they madethe demons and angels, do you really think you can beat them?Leviathas replies: I saw them near Roston.  They were probably just having ameeting there.You reply to Leviathas: I know I cant beat them, but i do know I can talk tothemLeviathas replies: I'm only assuming they made them, since they seemed to knowhow to create weapons to destroy them and discussed the war.Leviathas replies: There was a lot of tension between the two and it wasobvious they couldn't stand the meeting.You reply to Leviathas: are you talking about mobs or imms?Leviathas replies: I have no idea what they were.  I'm assuming they hadimmortality.You reply to Leviathas: hmmmmm since you know where to find them, ask them totalk to me for a bitLeviathas tells you:You're welcome to look for them, last place I saw them wasin Roston.dunno whats going to happen though"
