__Letter "60-65:	/wizards/amun/eyeofhell/rooms/middle_44 and transfered to /d/lodos/secret1 and a few mazes as well as the final layer.	Items you get:  Outlaw Flag		1. Go to Drac in the eye of hell and \"Show mirror to Drac\", He will 				ask you if you wish to continue the quest to become a vampire (just in 				case) and you say \"yes\" then you will transported to the secret room in 			lodos with the mirror and the corpse (on the east tower opposite the 				other secret room).			a. Drac will be there in spirit form (voice in your mind) and 					he'll give you directions: \"Set up mirror\" - this will place the 			mirror opposite the other mirror in the room, this action will 					bring the corpse to life and will try to attack the girl, you 					must kill the corpse and save her..she is Drac's sacrifice). 						b. Once the girl is saved a note will fall off the corpse, which 			contains an incantation that will act as a portal back to Drac, 				taking you and the girl. Drac will then Drink the girls blood, 					she is your sacrifice to him.  He asks you to join in drinking 					her blood, and the second you do you are thrown into the Hall of 			Mirrors.		2. The Hall of Mirrors is a maze, but a simple one...You are looking for 		the room that does NOT have your reflection in it...I think either have 			it to where you're name is in the room like a mob and you're looking for 		the room that you're name is NOT there...or by description if we cannot 			do the other thing.			a. In the room with no relfection you must \"Smash Mirror\" to 					lose your reflection and then enter the door that is behind it.  			You are then thrown into a lit area.		3. Because you're beginning to turn vampire you are partial to the light 		and it will do damage to you...This means you MUST put on the daywalker 			cloak to move through this area.  If you do not you will lose a enough 				HP to make it deadly (there will be something in the description that 		tells you basically this stuff).			a. You move through the area and come to a gate.  A few rooms in 			this area, It will tell you to \"break my jaw\" and \"insert 					fangs\".  You will not be allowed to go through the gate unless 					you have inserted your fangs. Once you do, you'll be in the 					Garden outside the layer/mansion.		4. Move through the maze of hedges and get to the door..it's that 				simple.			a. use the key you got from the \"slayer\" to get into the layer.		5. You're in the layer! Now just follow the last maze and find the Head 			Vampire!  When you find him, he gives a speech about ways of Vampires, 				but he is just a voice at this point...  At the end of his speech he 				reveals that he has been inside of you since you at the bat.. OMG he IS 			the bat!!  He command you to \"cut stomach\" so that he can be released 				from inside of you.			a. He takes his true form and asks you if you truely wish to 					become a vampire, if you say yes he will drink your blood then 					offer his blood.  If you say no (you're an idiot HA), no if you 				say no he will instantly kill you and you will lose everything 					you had on you.		6. Once you have been bitten and drank the blood of the Head Vampire, 				you return to the beginning with the \"Pale-skinned Man.\"			a. He will tell you that you must stay in the underground grave 				yard for a full 24 hours of unidle time (lasting through reboot 				and everything) there will be a start room..this will be where 					the class hall is (if that's cool).			b. Once you're 24 hours is up, you will be a Vampire and a 					global message announcing you're mortal death and your new 					immortal body and you will be informed that you're now a 					Vampire.  If you leave the room, it was for nothing and you are 				not a vampire and must start over a new character.***notes:  This MUST be done at night, and you MUST have an evil aura (which will be said in the first vision), as well as 90 in ALL stats, and you MUST be Demonic or Satanic, Perception MUST be MAXed.  You also MUST be outlawed (meaning PK someone in a law area) before going to Drac in the Eye of Hell (you're life is your final sacrifice)."
