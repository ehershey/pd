__Letter "Psicrush - sort of like mindsurge in merentha.  Takes 85% of the users mp and hurls it at the enemy.Psiblast (other name)PsiSummon-------25% chance to summon Fire Elemental25% chance to summon Air Elemental25% chance to summon Water Elemental25% chance to summon Earth Elementalcan't specify which one you get, it's random.When summoned you are para'd for 1-2 rounds and there's a 5% chance they will attack you instead of following you. This is also depending on your psionics skill and magic attack.  This would be a lvl 45-50 spell.  They would have special attacks based on the matter they are made out of.  Fire Elemental - envelopes the enemy and scorches him terribly.Air Elemental - flies beneath the enemy, picks them up in the air and drops them letting them slam onto the ground.Water Elemental - forms an enclosed sphere of water around the enemy suffocating them and para'ing them for 1-2 rounds.Earth Elemental - forms himself into a giant ball of dirt and stones and slams into the enemy.Just think I need a lvl 50 spell badly cause I dont get anything after lvl 35.  NEcromancers get Soulburn, and Pyromancers get shroud.  Since solidify is weaker my only spell would be, is, psistorm at lvl 45."
