__Letter "I am willing to rebalance how much 'eat corpse' gives,haven't really done a lot of testing on that yet.As for dragon stuff - I'm not going to put any new things inuntil I'm ready to open a new dragon quest. Unfortunately I don'tknow when that will be. I may go through and update all the oldabilities to the new balance system though.Feel free to come up with some ideas though, I check the boardsto find new ideas when I start on a sub."
