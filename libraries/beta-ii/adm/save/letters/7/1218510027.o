__Letter "Probation StatusAs of today, your probation status consists of these points:1. You are not allowed to take part in guild changes until you have reached a minimum of 6 players in your guild.	- Players refers to 6 different IP address, aka 6 		seperate people, not characters	- Players MUST have a significant amount of playing 	time, not idle time; and players will NOT be counted 	as active if they sign on and immediately off just to 	get a recent date.	- It is suggested that you rid your guild of inactive 	members (those that have not been on for a month or 	so), but that is completely up to you; but as you're 	trying to create an active guild, there is no need to 	keep those that will not be on.2. If you do NOT reach at least 6 fully active members by October 1st, your guild will be removed.Am I missing anything important?"
