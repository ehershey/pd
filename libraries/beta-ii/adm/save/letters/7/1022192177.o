__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Cookie to Nightshade Thu May 23 11:42:45 2002:-----Dude... I hope you can fix this. I know you couldn't erase my other pk of hermes... but I was in the arena and lost my heartbeat, and \"killed\" aziraphale 5 times. So now... I have 6 murder offenses and am an outlaw. We don't know what happened while we were fighting that caused it to happen... but we hung out a while and truced, waiting for an admin to get on or something, none did till I had to go to work. So finaly, I tried \"restartheart\" and died instantly, sending me to the loosers room. That's where I sit now and am about to go link-dead in. I'm not leavin here till I am no longer an outlaw and get the 5 deaths off my offense reord. Storm got on... gotta run.Cookie"
