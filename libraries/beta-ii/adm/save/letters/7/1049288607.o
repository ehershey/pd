__Letter "I would have posted this, but i am pressed for time.I am very much on your side when it comes to pk, i have a lifeand i dont spend all day on this game, nor do i know the best placesto xp. This char is the highest i have ever had on a mud, and i proud of itbut now that pk is back, i am scard to go out and xp. I dont have the timeto gain back lost lvls and still keep happy with the mud.I dont really know you, but i feel what your saying. I am totally with youatm i have currently stoped mudding, which \"was\" a favorite past time thathelped me relax.Like you said, all i want to do is, xp, exlpore, chat and be proud of my effort to make my charI hope that the posts bout flags and stuch all come into the mud.Cause i am going to be upset if all i have managed to do is waste my time on this fun mudand charIf you reamber me, iam Orcha as well.Signing out, Scoff."
