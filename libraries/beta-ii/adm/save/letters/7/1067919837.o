Never hear anything fromanyone anymore.  Just, theres an EQ bug.  Constantly hearing that, but still,no one tries to fix it.  Ive tried, and it has worked for many days, then Iguess someone has fucked around with some code again and fragged it all up. Since im pretty much out of the circle, or group it seems right now, because Iget no communication, I was wondering whats all going on.  Hows your livedgoing.  Ill tell you how mine is going.  I dont trust anyone.  Seriously. About anyone Ive ever known and trusted, has betrayed it someway, and I figurethey can go to hell.  They can go fuck themselves.  My moms a bitch.  I said she should get me on some kind of anti-depressent, soI would stop having these fits of major depression, and she fucking comes offwith, \"Your TOO young for those.  I have em, but I dont even take them.\"  Idont if shes ever gonna realize I dont give a fuck about what she thinks.  Iwonder what she thinks the age is.  Will she think im too young when or if Ikill myself.  Good question.  Good question is, would anyone.  That are some ofthe things that have been going through my head.  Sounds great up there.  So,if anyone wonders why I say im going crazy, they know why.  Good day toeveryone, maybe see you all around sometime...  Some reason I dont see thathappening though.  I talked to Stormbringer tonight, which was the first timein 2 weeks.Whit - Crazed, insane, suicidal, the works.--  EDITJust thought I would add, I understand Stormbringer's position also.=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+="
