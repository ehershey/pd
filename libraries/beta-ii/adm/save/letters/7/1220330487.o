__Letter "Hey, I wanted to remarry you; but it seems you are never on. Please mail me back and let me know if you want to remarry me. If not I will remain married to Rohl... I think, LOL. I actually liked being your \"wife\" so I'd love to redo that sometime. I will make sure Rohl knows this before I \"marry\" him. Send me a mail if you want to redo our \"marriage\" :PHope all is well with you in Aussieland.PS My mentor in my PhD program is from Aussieland.. he's fucking awsome and I think of you and all you're fucked up friends everytime he talks about how cool Austrailia is.:P Sugar"
