__Letter "Okay I posted these a while ago on the zerker board, but I will mail them to you:I think once you are level 50 you should get some new melee rage attacks, and loose some of the old ones aka: headbut/jab, some of my ideas for new ones:Shotgun:Message: You sway back from your foes attack, and close with great speed delivering punches in quick succession.Effect: Dodges one of the opponents attacks (nullifing the damage) and does 3-6 (random) low damage attacks (melee/str based, similar to jab)Haymaker:Message: Roaring with fury, you let loose with a punch to knock your foes teeth out!Effect: Med-High damage attack, has a 50% chance to stun foe.Crash tackle:Message: You throw your whole weight at your foe, and pull them to the ground.Effect: Med damage attack, that knocks foe down.Shrug:Message: You take the blow to your chin, and shrug it off, grining while blood flows from your lips.Effect: Lowers the damage from all atacks that round.Groin Shot:Message: Forgetting about honour, you kick the foe square in the groin, making his eyes bulge.Effect med-high damge attack 75% chance to stun, rare tho.If you want more ideas, I might be able to think some up, please let me know if any of these will get through :)."
