__Letter "Hi Daboura,I was hoping you could have a look at the blue dragon form of breathe. It seems bugged up and is getting 100% paralyze on me, from Smite.My stats are 166str, 151con, 151dex, 101cha, 101int, 101wis. I have 256MD and 500def. Level100 (copy me whenever to get a proper look) - and the character Smite *cannot* fail to paralyze me *every* round with his breathe. I'm not sure if it is an actual bug, really looks like it though, or if it is just a big balance thing, but it is *really* throwing things out of whack when a lvl50 blue dragon and any other character in the mud can take down ANYONE, because of the perfect para."
