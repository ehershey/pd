__Letter "Someone really awesome (hint: it's you) once told me that gettingyour rest was really important. :) We will see each other soon, Iam sure. In the meantime, there's mudmail and email and all kindsof stuff. :) I hope you slept well last night. I did too, I'd say.Had some funky dreams about working for the police or somethingundercover trying to bust this guy during illegal activities. I wasposing as a gardener trying to speak in a fake Mexican accent. Hehe, these dreams o mine. :) Anyway, I hope to see you later. :)Love,James"
