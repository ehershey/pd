__Letter "Hiya Daboura,When you take a look at fighters and Paladins, can you have a look at the paladin's selection of spells. Most noticeably we have cripple, and even though it is specific to our subclass, it totally sucks monkey nuts. ^_^What I mean is that slash does about 50% more damage than cripple, and I have max faith and fairly good magic attack for a paladin. Not only that, cripple cuts out our idle rounds, so technically it should be doing more damage than our abilities like slash.Since we have boost, there is no reason to use spells over abilities due to sp/mp consumption.If you are hardcore going into spells and abilities, you might want to review classes that can heal, and perhaps lower their damage, and maybe give them a few extra buffing spells. I think it would make for a nice partying aspect where these classes and great at exp'ing solo, but can really speed things up in a duo."
