__Letter "Arcanis meets your gaze, her piercing %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^blue eyes%^RESET%^ revealing nothing.  It is suddenly quite obvious that she is a fallen angels you hear about, though her aura is one of a %^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^holy%^RESET%^ presence, you since a distortion, something twisted within her.  Though quite beautiful, you can tell she can hold her own, and would willingly fight for what she believes in. Suddenly, her hair catches your eyes, as locks of %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^golden blonde hair%^RESET%^0 cascades down around her face.  Following her hair, you notice that a small %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^pentagram%^RESET%^ hangs around her neck, dangling just above her supple breasts.  A symbol of her faith and servitude to her Dark Lord, Asmodeus.  Your eyes continue to wander down her body, unconsciously taking in ever inch, following right down to her strong, yet sleek, legs.  Her eyes suddenly %^RED%^blaze with anger%^RESET%^ as her great wings shudder, and you are forced to look away."
