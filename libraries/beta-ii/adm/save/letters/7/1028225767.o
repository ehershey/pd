__Letter "At the moment i dont have any experience with coding but i'll be able to learn fast i figure. I can code in HTML, Javascript, and Java. I'm sure wraith and detach would be able to help me out with the basics of codingFor the first bit i wouldnt need to know too much coding as it mostly be thinking up new formulas, and in that time i think i could learn enough of basics that i could code for you (i wanna learn how to code my own area anyways and its about time i got off my lazy ass and learned hehe).Anyways give it some thought. I think i could help a lot of stuff for you. You could check it all over and if you dont like it then just toss it out-- Ash"
