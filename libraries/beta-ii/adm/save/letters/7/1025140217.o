__Letter "Although I did apologize in the end, we had a bit of a tit for tat that you might want to look over on the dragon and cre lines, here is what I saved from cre and what happened.I was snooping a player for the dragon quest, seeker kills me over and over. Gabriel and hermes had cussed once on teh angel line and apoloigized about it. Gabriel then cusses on the illuminati line then apologizes about it, I told him guild lines were fine to cuss on and cussed a bit on it myself. Seeker kills me for it, then he goes on the illuminati line and tells them no cussing. Thats where this started:Seeker <cre> yepWraith <cre> dragon is publicSeeker <cre> uuhh no its notSeeker <cre> what makes it any different than illuminatiSeeker <cre> ?Wraith <cre> was too last time I checkedSeeker <cre> so everybody on the mud has access to it?Seeker <cre> i think not<cre> Wraith grumbles, whers stormieSeeker <cre> explain your definition of \"public\" lineWraith <cre> a line that is set as a class/subclass or public(newbie, OOCtrivia colleseum)Wraith <cre> dragon lines do fall under that categorySeeker <cre> so explain to me... just because dragon is a class.. its public?Seeker <cre> and illuminati is not because its a guild?Seeker <cre> public lines are any line that EVERYBODY getsSeeker <cre> ex: newbie,OOC,colleseum etc..Wraith <cre> guild lines were bought by the players, do use as they see fitSeeker <cre> so just because the player bought it.. they have a right to cusson it? i think notSeeker <cre> if it offended somebodySeeker <cre> cussing on dragon is NOTHING like cussing on newbieSeeker <cre> and was no reason for whatever punishment you thought offWraith <cre> I killed you once for every cuss word you hadSeeker <cre> and nobody was offended by my profanity so i see no reason for itSeeker <cre> and i killed you for every cuss word you have saidWraith <cre> Allright then, lets take a poll of the dragons and see if theywant to allow cussing on their lines, If stormie agrees with the votes then itsallowed. Guild lines have ALWAYS been allowed to cuss, least wise since I owneddarksouls.Wraith <cre> and if you want to do that for the guild lines, I dont think wewould need stormies approval for those certain lines.Is the last half of the cre arguement.Seeker thinks I was stepping over my bounds as Law when I kept killing him off for all those cuss words a while back. Remember when you asked him how he liked your new Law-man?So we argued on what was public and what wasnt. Id like you to look over what happened and let me know what you think about it all, whether you think I was stepping over my bounds, and same for seeker when he undermined me on the illuminati line."
