__Letter "Uhm, I just sold a starscream to Homer, You sell Starscream for 998 gold.and I check to see how much money I have, and it says I don't have anything.Also, I noticed when I sold everything from 7 filled diamonds, I only made 60,000 gold (around there), and normally 4 diamonds makes me that much. So..is there something wrong with the merchants or something? Lemme know, thanks :)-jen"
