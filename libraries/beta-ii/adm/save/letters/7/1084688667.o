__Letter "Well, we might as well start from the start, then.Ethereal's guild updates were more or less completed, although not tested for bugs and balance. She talked to Whit and he promised to go over the guild and items with her and fix it, but he never did. Instead, he simply gave approval for them to be added straight into the MUD without any form of checking- Kumi told me about this approval and asked that I add it. Since she had approval, I voiced my deep concern that the code had not been checked for balance or bugs, but added it to the MUD. It took me seven hours from start to finish to do so, because large portions of the area including weapons, items and armour flat out didn't load, so they were being fixed on the fly. Then it was asked that I open the area to the MUD- I balked at this, claiming a lot of the items were unbalanced and not ready to be implimented, but both Kumi and Evolution jumped on me and insisted that it be added right away.The result was pretty terrible. The weapons were *massively* unbalanced, doing catastrophic amounts of damage and healing the player substancially when a special went off (in a similar fashion to Illuminati's swords, which were crimped earlier, although significantly more powerful). The armour by and large was ok, except for two items which caused me grave concern. One was a ring which would allow one to change their alignment at will (like carrying around the angel's wading pool), another was an item which was supposedly an exact copy of an Illuminati one, but turned out to be exactly twice as powerful and cost one quarter as much. There was a massive fight (over MSN) with Evolution, where he insisted I reduce the cost of the item again, because it was \"not my place\" to check balance and that Whit was going to do it later. Eventually I set the item to be exactly the same as the Illuminati one in terms of price and armour, and let it in like that.This was all fine. I was not happy, but I'd done my job and added the stuff as requested. Until today. Kumi had recognised that the weapons were overpowered and said something over her line which was that no players were to use them. However, one of her guild members apparently didn't get that message, and used the weapons in the arena. The player to whom they were used against complained, and there was a massive row which was only sorted when Daos, Helena, myself and Kumi were all put in the same room and the problems aired. The basic way that went was that all parties agreed to remove the weapons until they could be balanced, however, this left the armour and other items unaccounted for.My problem lies not in the code (errors are made in code, this is unavoidable, and Evolution admitted he had to guess the values of weight, armour protection damage, etc for the items). Bugs can be fixed, balance can be made. My problem lies in the way the code was implimented (thrown onto the MUD without any form of checking what-so-ever). This left me in the embaressing situation of accidently updating buggy rooms (rooms which had players inside them, which caused them to be force quitted out), having to hunt around and remove all copies of certain items, and spending a fair hunk of my Saturday fixing up problems which should have been caught in testing, while trying to avoid players who were swarming to see their new stuff.I'm not sure why you're angry with me... :/ but, yeah... I did my best in the situation, and while Ethereal and Kumi annoy me greatly (and greater still every day) as an imm I still have to treat them like I would any other guild. I was not happy putting in their new stuff, but it had been approved, so... I just did it. I'm sorry if I've hurt or upset you in any way, it wasn't intended, and I really hope this letter explains some of the things. If you think I've done wrong please tell me, and I'll see what I can do to make amends.-- Ven."
