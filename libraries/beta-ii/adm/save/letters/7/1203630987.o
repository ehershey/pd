__Letter "Hey love. :) I mean, how else was I gonna start this mail? :) I skippedmy early class to focus on my presentation today for my late class. Gonnameet with some of the group and run through it like a burrito! :) Likethe imagery? I hope you had an excellent day. And if not an excellent day,then a helpful day. And if not a helpful day, a fun day. But that mightbe asking too much? I will try to see you sometime. Maybe I'll be that lucky. In the meantime, take care, dont stress and I miss you LOTS. :) Talk to you soon, loveLove,James"
