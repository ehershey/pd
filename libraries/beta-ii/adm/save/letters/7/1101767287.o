__Letter "Hey Stormy,I was wondering if you're looking for any more Imms right now.  I'd be willing to do some behind the scene stuff, like coming up with new systems (kinda of got a start with something that makes searching for items in an inventory easier), skills, classes, etc., and creating items, especially ones that do unique or different things which require some actual coding.  I could do areas, but I'm very bad at doing room descriptions unless I put a ton of effort into it and give myself headaches (not really, but I hope you get what I mean).  If it helps any, and if you didn't remember, I'm Daboura/Durst's roommate, so you could talk to him about me if you wanted.  You can reach me on MSN if I'm ever on... I should be on your list already, w0rm@programmer.netAnyway, get back to me, let me know if you have any questions and such.-Nesoo"
