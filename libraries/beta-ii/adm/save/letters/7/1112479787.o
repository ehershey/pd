__Letter "Anyways, just wanna wrap up by saying, the reason I went kataan ( I was told you would ask why :P) is because people were always saying kataans blow, so I was like i'm gonna take this char and i'm gonna show the whole mud that the class is actually really goodSo unfortunately I remorted, and I got to lvl 37, I trained all my skills but the class really is crippled and unbalanced, I know you balanced it back in tha day, but so much has changed since then it's just out of whack, my lvl 1 spell does more damage than anything by far, and it still doesnt doo much at all. I made a terrible mistake, I ruined a characted that had like 7 weeks of playing time and he almost never idled.I asked a lot of the players over the newbie line, and Daos was present for this, all of them, even people i've pk'd as a fighter were all like heck yea, get stormy to do it, so i'm sure the players on the mud wont mindoi, sorry I made this so long, but i'm beggin ya"
