__Letter "Hey there :) I'm alive, and back in mostly one piece... just walked in the door. If I have to do this trip again (looks likely), no way in HELL am I going through Detroit. Not one damned flight was on time, un-cancelled, un-delayed, etc. :)I'm good, just really worn out. So very worn out. Ohio's never an easy trip for me. But, c'est la vie. :)I hope you're sleeping well... I'm to bed with the gattos.You know... I won the 'most interesting socks of the day' prize at the airport :) Pepe LePeu :)Go me. :) At least they didn't feel me up this time.Tiredly,-Heather"
