__Letter "My thoughts, thought I should send them when I have a chance. I don't know if you know them already, but better to send them I think.Just a quick write-up:Spell Balance Notes:Notes on Balance Difficulties:****************low lvl abils****************Slash is good at low lvls and low stats. However, once you are lvl 40-50 and stats start costing you over 6 million exp a point. Then it becomes hard to do more damage.Example: Slash does 100 dmg. Improve strength 1 point for 600k. Now do 104 dmg.Example: Slash does 200 dmg. Improve strength 1 point for 3 Mil Now do 204 dmg.You are spending 5 times as much exp for half the increase in damage (As a percentage).These aren't real numbers, just examples.************************multiple attack abils************************Paladin gets dispell and slash. If dispell is better than slash then I will *never* use slash because it slows me down. Each subclass only needs 6 attack abils/spells at most.Lvl1 - Lvl10 - Lvl 15 - Lvl 20 - Lvl 35 - Lvl 50 - A Multihit.If I get 2 new attack abils at lvl 5, I will only use the better one.Also, a problem particular to paladins is if their spells are better than their abils, then paladins have many useless abils and improve/train their expensive stats/skills. I had alot of trouble with this as a player.*******************Auxiliary spells*******************Things like Paralyze/Cure/Shield.This is the big problem with Clerics, and it is why they are so overpowered.A cleric can not only paralyze and take no dmg, but when he does take dmg he paralyzes the enemy again straight away, cures all of the dmg the next round, and then continues to do LOTS of dmg with his powerful spell 'Lifewarp'. He can also cast shield on himself to take less damage.So a cleric is a powerful attack class, a powerful heling class, and a powerful defending class all in one.If I want to kill a cleric I must be able to do it in 1 round, because any longer he can paralyze, cure and be back on full hp and killing me straight away. It gives them a large advantage against mobs too.All I can think of. - Aziraphale"
