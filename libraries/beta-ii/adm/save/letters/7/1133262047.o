__Letter "The new fly command is omgwtfCOOOOOOLhowever, can we adjust it so that when you are in the fly room it automatically turns the map off for the player. It *really* messes the thing up so that you have no way to tell where you are.What I mean is, for the long desscription of the room, if it is the flying room it just doesn't do the map, or it assumes that the maps veriable for hte player is turned off."
