__Letter "The command i have been working on has now been finalized.It has it's own security system built into it outside of theEUID system. This was to permit the builders to lock and/orallow people to/from access to their objects with this command.The command now has the ability to report on just about everyinherit present in std.hI have placed it in the /cmds/creator directory so the buildersmay use it.If you wish to lock your files so builders can not use summaryon them, add this function to your workroom.cstring *access_allowed() {return ({ < people's names > }); }IronmanPS -- If access_allowed() is NOT in your workroom.c, anyone maysummerize you objects. If it is in your workroom, only admins,archwizards, and members of the array that access_allowed()returns may use summary on objects made with your /wizards files."
