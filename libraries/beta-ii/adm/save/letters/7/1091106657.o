__Letter "The city's name is Khaedon.It is part of a realm of magic.It is shrouded in darkness, there is no day.It is lit by the flowers the grow in the trees, and the moths that feed upon them.Jewelery is fashioned from a glowing gem dubbed lucite.While clothes are made from a fine spun silk made from the coccoons of the moths.(the silk glows)All of these things come in a variety of colors roughly about 5.There will be three moons: red, blue, and white.The city is controled by the Aekari and their living Goddess Kaimei.  Kaimei choices a new Aekari host every so often and her old host often dies of sorrow at the loss of the Goddess.  The races is primarily ran by the females for this reason.  The Aekari are a xenophobic race and despise the thought of having their beautiful home soiled by outsiders.This area is intended for levels 50 +.  However a faerie could stroll in unharmed.  Any other race will have to fight everything that draws breath.This is merely one city in a realm I have been designing for a few years, and I have only briefly touched upon the society of the Aekari.I will await your thoughts on the matter before I begin construction.Your servant,Zoisite"
