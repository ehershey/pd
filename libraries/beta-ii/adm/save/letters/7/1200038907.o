__Letter "The following is a letter I wrote last night before we spoke whileI was at work:Dear Rayna,   I am writing this at work in a booth in a parking lot.I am re-typing this when I get home. Howve you been? Excellent, Ihope. :) Me, I'm not too bad. Just going through withdrawal. :)This coming Monday (1/14), the students return to school and ourmini-vacation comes to an end. I need to register for classes soon.Maybe that'll happen this week. Meanwhile, I miss you like cerealmisses milk, like milk misses cookies and like cookies misskindergarteners. My night is more than half-finished. Gonna lock upsome classrooms and junk soon. Anyways, back to work and hope 2 hearfrom...It trailed off there. I was a lil sleepy, hehe. Luckily, at 4am ina dark booth on an empty street, you can get away with that. Notthat I make that a habit, mind you! Anyway, take care, my love.Sorry I missed you. But hopefully, I won't miss you in the morning.:) Please be well, grieve as you must and be strong for your brotherin this sad, sad time. My thoughts, nearly all of them, are with youand yours. Love,James"
