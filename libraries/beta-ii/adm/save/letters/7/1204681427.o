__Letter "Hey love, I have been missing you a whole heck of a lot. Altho, knowing it would be just until today made it easier. The sad partis that missing you is just starting. In the morning, Myra and Russ and I all go to Dayton, Ohio to visit an old friend and hisfamily. We will be gone prolly til Sunday. So this isn't gonna be a good week for talking to the woman I love. :( I do plan ongetting on periodically tho. The house has internet and Russ hasa laptop. I hope getting settled has been a smooth process foryou and not too draining.Please lemme know how it went? I will try to leave you moredetailed mails so you know what's going on with me too. :) I hadan absolutely awesome night at work last night, despite not havingmuch sleep. I felt truly blessed. Only improvement woulda been?You guessed it...some Rayna time. :DOk, I plan to get mini-nap b4 work. So, off I go to sleepytown.Maybe I can see you tonight on an early break? We'll just haveto see. Loving you very much,James"
