__Letter "Hi, it is Rayna. I swore to myself that I would never come back on thisgame.  It seems a comforting place somehow, but with bad memories.I was honestly trying to make something work with James (Uza), butI was feeling like I was not going fast enough to make things work.  I wasnot comfortable giving out information and not yet ready for a relationship,since I've had so many bad ones. My Dad had been ill for awhile, but it was still hard for me to even think ofit.  I felt pressured by James to move things forward, but I was stallingbecause I knew I wasn't ready yet to move it any more forward.  I wascomfortable with the way it was, but I knew I should move it forward, butcouldn't.I know you don't really need to know the whole story, but I value yourfriendship and although James wants to stay friends, it is too painful.If you could please keep this between us, I'd appreciate it.  I do likeplaying here and I want to be anonymous.  If you feel your friendshipwith James is too valuable to talk to me, it's okay, I understand.A lot of the stalling was because of personal problems and my Dad beingill.  I had already been off the game for awhile, but James sent me an emailto end things.  I was already having enough home problems and that sortof was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I felt slighted because I didn't get any kind of sympathetic note about myDad, even though I had told him.  If you feel you'll be betraying James, I understand, and I will remove thisalt altogether.  If I do come on here, it would then be anonymous so thatI can at least play some time.thanks for listening, I always valued your friendship.  I did remove myMyspace, but if you still remain my friend, I will add you to a new onewhen I make it.Hugs,Rayna"
