__Letter "As you will see I did something bad.  I am not going to pretend that I didn't; however, I would like to point out that I have never done it before.  The Action    I took out money from this alt, Goldenberry, and gave it to another alt.The Reasoning    The reason I did this is because the economy in this game is not very good at all.  There are very few, actual, players and everything is so expensive for the little bit of money you get from mobs.  I help out new players because the money one starts with is miniscule (i dont know if that is spelled right).  I know that is my own fault and I know that it is my choice, but the money one gets as a new player is not good.My Plea    This was my frist time doing anything like this and I know it was wrong, which is why i put the money back right where i got it from; I did not use it, not even one bit.  This is also the reason I am turning myself in.  I know you will see what happened, and I feel it is better to confess rather than just let you guys come to me.  I am a big player on this mud and I love it; I am probably one of the most active players you have.  I accept the consequences to come; but I ask that you please go easy on me, seeing how this is my first time and I put everything back without using it.  I do not wish to be deleted from the game; however, I know that this is an option.  I do my best to what is right, and I feel this letter is the right thing to do.  I apologize for even doing it in the first place, which is why I did, and am, righting my wrong.  Thank you.Goldenberry"
