__Letter "It definitely does my heart good to hear you say that. Because, although I am usually all about jokes, rubber chickens, whoopiecushions, exploding cigars, banana cream pies, chinese fingertraps, seltzer bottles, hand grenades filled with tapioca pudding,noisemakers, firecrackers and Rolaids, I am also all about you.You are the xen to my axe, the yin to my yang, the dressing tomy salad and the Ex-Lax to my constipation. You move me. And Ilove you too. I was carrying a torch for you but it looks likeyou are luckily carrying a torch for me, too. :)I am filled with anticipation for our next meeting when these words can fly straight from my lips to your heart. Take care til next we meet, love.Axenos"
