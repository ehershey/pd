__Letter "Hey love, this is my last night before the weekend starts. :D It looks like we'll be going to New York to visit my father andsister who had their birthdays last and this week, respectively.Hopefully, we can make it a one-day affair cuz I'd hate to spendthe whole weekend there. I'd much prefer to spend some time withyou but gotta be a good son/brother too. :) I am gonna get someboxing tickets for me, my dad and brother-in-law. It should bea fun time. :D I'll letcha know what's going on as thingsprogress. I hope you have a good night and sleep well. Pleasetake care of my Rayna?Love,James"
