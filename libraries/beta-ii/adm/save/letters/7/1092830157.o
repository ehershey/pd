__Letter "Blits' room can replace either Tsuke, Helena, or Crem's room. Here's the description:As you enter this room you first notice the great height of it, The stonewalls covered in sticky white Raknid webbing acting as a ladder for Blits toget to his coccoon-like bed. Embedded into the webbed framework are largestone shelves with assorted rare items that Blits has collected on hisjourneys throughout the realm.The room echoes.There is a musky smell to the room.Thanks!"
