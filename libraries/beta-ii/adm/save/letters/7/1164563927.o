__Letter "Well i went lvl 50 as a raknid berserker i had 100 strength 62 cons 52 dex 9 int 8 wis 20 charisma after this i decided to go angel i solved the maze, completed the quest typed accept gift, then ascend, then become archangel, i became an archangel but it dint quit me out it gave me a bug so i hit become archangel a few more times cuz it dint quit me out so i decided to quit myself out so i quit out i log back on and my stats were bugged and it dint show up, i was somehow a berserker and an angel, i dint have my halo, along with that i talked to Nulvect about how 100 str becomes 25 strength after remorting to angel because i remorted to demon and that same 100 strength became 67 strength so thats a totally unfair advantage against angels vs. demons there should be no reason demons get this unfair advantage like they have in the past along with this said i cannot become a subclass i seem to be bugged there too it wont let me pick paladin it says something about me picking a path in life already althought i have not, please help me im sort of sick and tired of these bugs Thanks if you do help me or read this :)"
