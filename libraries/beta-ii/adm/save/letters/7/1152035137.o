__Letter "For a hundred days and a hundred nights the battle raged in the sky. And great was the slaughter. At last only one of the heroes remained alive, and that was Tsuke. All around him the demons gathered, a forest of spears confronting him. Tsuke killed the demons in their thousands, but still they came. And at the last even he grew bored with the endless fighting, and, plunging his cross into the ground, he called upon the Holy Flame to aid him."
