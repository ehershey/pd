__Letter "I need to chat with you when you get this message. It's kinda important.I'm not gonna get into details in a mail message. I perfer to \"speak\"with a person face to face if i can when it's important.I just want to make it clear what my position here is in the PD world.You made me an offical builder. Stormy gave me the reigns to designthe security system and tutorial system for builders. I just wishfor a clear definition of what my role(s) are according to theadministration of the mud.I have wilfully abstained from playing on the main port due to myfeeling it would be a conflict of interest to play when i have fullaccess to all the files on builders. Information, especially questinformation needs to be safegarded. I'm venomously rabid when it comesto safeguarding the information. It's why i designed the new securitysystem for the builders port :)Please speak to me either here or on builders when you get this.Ironman"
