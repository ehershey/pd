__Letter "Hi Nesoo, Ive got an idea for ya :)Healing oils/stones and sp oils/stonesThe ones currently avalible are great up untill about lvl 50ish, but then due to the fact the char prolly has pretty good stats and hp in the vicinity of 2000-2500 and the same for sp, the current oils/stones which only heal around 150-250 of either start to become a bit uselessby thsat lvl most abils use more than they heal, im not saying make stronger oils and stuffso that everyone can use them, but maybe make it so that only lvl 50+ chars can and not heaps stronger healing either but just a lil, coz if i run outa sp with Paranoia..i need to rub like13 oils lolso yeah, anyways, if you can understand this mail see what you think heheLater matePenance"
