__Letter "By default the Nightmare mudlib will encode passwords, that way even theadmins don't know what your password is, though we can change your passwordto something else we can not decode it and tell you what it is if you haveforgotten it.  That is how we have things set up on Merentha as well.It is very easy to recode the MUD to not encode passwords, and thus whenyour password is saved it is saved as your password and not an encodedstring.  By not encoding your password any one with access (any admin) toyour player file can read your password.Now, why am I telling you this?  Well looking at the list of players whohave recently claimed to have gotten their characters stolen, and comparingthat list to multiple harass and other logs I came up with a hypothesis,which I tested and found to be true.  Here is a scenario:Player1 tells you: Hey come to primal darkness, its cool.Your reply: ok, coming....<you then proceed to log into primal darkness, using the same password asyou do here>The next day you find out someone has hacked your character and took allyour money and suicided you on Merentha.I tested this with a few high level players here.  Primal Darkness does notencode their passwords, their admins then seach through your player filefor your passwords and then try that same password here after you create acharacter over there.It is each player's responsibility to keep their password secret, whichmeans that you should use a different password for each MUD you play.  Ifyour password is stolen in any matter, including the unethical actions ofadmins on other MUDs you are still responsibile and you will be deleted andbanned."
