__Letter "PLease put anything that pertains to coding on the tutorial boardon the builders port. I set that board up specifically FOR thatpurpose. Anytime you want to leave instructions of a coding natureplease pu them there. I dont want the main imm board cluttered withcode. We can leave coding info on the other board forever if we wantbut the main one would get to crowded for that. I'll move your postsover there and let the imms know."
