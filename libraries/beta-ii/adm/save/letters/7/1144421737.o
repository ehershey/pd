__Letter "I don't know how he violated any rule.I'm looking at the guild pk rules now and I see nothing violated. \"A guild and all of its members are permitted to kill a specific member of another guild exactly one time, until a five day period of wait has elapsed. After this delay, conflict may legally be resumed.\"The darksoul boards show when Myst killed Agnidev the first time (April 2nd) and the 2nd time (April 7th). He waited for the 5 days to elapse before pking him again.I see no rule that violated here."
