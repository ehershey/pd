__Letter "Heya Mocha,Just letting you know that I'm ciding   =/I just want to let you know that the pleasure was all mine to associatewith a great gal like you. The reason I'm ciding is I just want to break allties with you know who  ;). Things aren't going right and I realized I wasgoing after pleasure instead of happiness. I don't fell to happy lately. She's too complex and I expected too much out of this   =/. Anyway, I wish you the best in the future. I know you're a bright great gal who's potential is limitless. So go out there, fight the good fight and make it count   =). Mr. Right will come along eventually,don't rush it like me and regret it later. If ya want to, you can reach me at rtdate@hotmail.com. I'm so sorry I have to do this, but I'm just so hurt atmthat I think this is for the best and that's what I'm gonna do, do the best forme, not what my flesh wants. Anyway, it's been a great 2 or so years to talk to yawish we can keep in touch. Well if this the ultimate goodbye, thanks for listening to me, you made a great imnpact on me and will do to many others also.Keep being the person you are, you will make MANY people's livesbetter. Tell Stormy I said bye too  ;(Best wishes,Ronnie  aka Penny"
