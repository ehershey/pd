__Letter "No matter how hard you work, there will always be someone out there with less of a life than you.I hate to break it to you, but Rueznor joined PD sometime after yesterday afternoon, and is already level 25.  He's a saintly Pyromancer.  His firebomb kills 25ks in 3 rounds.  ROOMS of 25ks.  He already kills way faster than I do.Why?  He partied with a black dragon who must have been low level.  I totally think it's not cool."
