__Letter "LoI know you know about Illum's swords..but i was wondering if you could downgrade them severly next time your on..Just an example incase you dont know how powerful they are;Wielding 1 holy sword, i had 9mp, killed a mob, after sacing it, i had 557mp..Normal Mp doesnt generate that fast and i dont use orbs. This was 2 rounds with one sword. Nice Mp specially for a paladin who uses boost abit..Wielding 2 Holy swords i killed all of drow using only 50 healing fires. 50 for all of drow, normally i use 200-300.The other day when i had 1 holy sword wielded, i gained over 400sp in a round. thats like the same as 6-7 ointments.Also there daggers give 150sp a special and their crest puts you on fully armoured from unarmoured and gives md.Aziraphale just hit legend...with high stats, all because he cheats..and umm, i wont say anymore cause im not impressed :/Oh, i heard he wasnt ridded because you dont want to lose players... I think thats utterly crap, his cheated with prator and now with aziraphale and his still here. Ashram gets dested for killing 7 players, Aziraphale cheats/scripts/has a copy of all the spells and abils and he still plays.sorry for the complaining, i just wanted to tell an admin how i felt about it. he should be dested.Lac would rather play with a small player base then with a cheating one."
