__Letter "\"Letter 3:Mon Jul  1 21:34:16 2002 from AziraphaleTo: Scarface Subject: ElathiusElathius has said that he would 'appreciate' it if you left him alone.So please, no more questioning him on anything. - Aziraphale% % dLetter 3 is now marked for deletion.% q1 letters deleted.\"___________________________________Ok, first...Elathius was a traitor in my guild. He lied about his alts, and I kicked him out.  I also gave the order to kill him which he would not know.  Therefore this 'questioning' bullshit is just that, bullshit, I kicked him out and said quit and lose my line, end of story, didn't even talk to him after that.  I think aziraphale should be punished for trying to impose his will on players without any reason except that his friends are complaining to him irl telling him to get us off their backs.  "
