__Letter "ahh yeah sorry to bother you but i was talking to daos and i remember something about being able to change your name, but there is not so i asked daos if it would be possible to get my name changedand daos told me to take it to you. so i was woundering if it would be possible to change my name, and like daos you probally are thinking the same thing he did \"why the hell choose the name in the first place\". well as i told daos lets just say i was not right in the head when i chose itwell if it is possable or not please mail me back. and if it is possable even when im not on could you please change my name to Steel i would be much appreciative "
