__Letter "I understand your problem and I know exactly how you feel.  Unfortunately, although I have the will to undergo many evil acts, I have not the power anymore.  Death, ressurrection and lack of training have taken their toll on me.  This is not to say that you may not be a member.  You still may if you wish, though each must start at the lowest level and prove themselves worthy of having any power within my halls.  First, if you still wish to join, seek out the Unholy hall.  It is located where the earth conquers the sun.Leviathas"
