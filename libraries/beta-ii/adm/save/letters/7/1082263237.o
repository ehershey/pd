__Letter "i've heard that your upset about me pk'ing posenda. which is fair enough, considering that your friends. but just so you know, i don't pk without a reason, there are several people who i want to pk for various reasons, but they all have reasons, including posenda. in posenda's case it was because he was hugging/drooling/etc. on helena. and i _did_ warn him to cease and desist. and then i warned him that i would kill him. the reason that i take offence at things like this is because Helena is my Real Life Girlfriend, and she has had problems with people harassing her in this way, and yes all of these people are on my list. i know that this might not seem like a good enough reason for you. but whatever, i have to stand up for what i believe in, and posenda wont be the last to die by my hands.I hope you understand, and I hope you stay in the guild.          -- Tsuke.P.s. I gave his stuff back, but i did keep his gold."
