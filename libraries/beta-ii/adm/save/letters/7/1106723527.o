Me and tia were hunting in the rhondale forest when genocide tried to kill her, she escaped to safety. at which point she called her friends and we all went to the safe zone in the rhondale []. at this point we determined how to get genocide back for the attempt, we went north with him following anguish, and tia got that kill on genocide, with help from others. i did not participate in that attempt, nor did yakko (ever participate actually for yakko).  bellos backstabbef but failed to get the kill. again genocide came back while we were hunting, and this time bellos backstabbed him, and did get the kill. at this point bellos left. bellos already owed geno for a previos pk against him, and was even with him now. we continued hunting, and again genocide came, he was stealing from tia knowin full well that if we did anything we would get in trouble. anguish came in and once again genocide died and anguish left. again we continued hunting, and again genocide showed up harassin tia by stealin her money. aggravated myself he would continually do this and harass us, i killed him myself, aware that i was going to be in trouble for my actions. annoyed we went back to hunting, and one final time genocide showed up and harassed and stole from tia. Tia killed him again, solo. that is the best i can do"
