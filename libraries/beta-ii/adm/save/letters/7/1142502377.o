__Letter "I spoke with Daboura yesterday about possibly coding dragons spells/abilities. He didn't seem like it was a big deal, but he told me to touch base with you. I can do rooms, mobs, etc. but haven't really dove into the spells part yet. I could probably do so with looking at some various examples, but anyway, just letting you know. Is there any time this weekend you'll be on builders? Mail me back, please.Smokey"
