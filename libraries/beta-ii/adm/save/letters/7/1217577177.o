__Letter "also about this gag, it appears as if it's not a timed gag since in score it just says You are gagged. and there's no timer.  i'm pretty sure mentioning the fact that i have a disease on the newbie line shouldn't earn me a timeless gag.  could i get a timed one instead?  if i had said that i had AIDS i doubt i would have been gagged.  too bad i didn't get that instead of herpes."
