__Letter "                                 Chapter one                             Lies Alexia Canon woke up on June 23 just like every other morning. She got up, looked in her mirror, went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and get dressed, and then went downstairs for breakfast. Although this particular morning was a little different, when she went downstairs she nearly jumped about ten feet in the air as her mother, Amy, yelled, \"Happy birthday.\" She had made her favorite chocolate chip pancakes like she did every morning on her birthday, which was her favorite part. As she sat down to eat, her father, Blake, came downstairs, he grabbed some juice, said goodbye, then left to go to work. This may seem like an ordinary family, but truthfully, it was not. Alexia was a witch; she was just like the rest of her family. Some of the finest witches and wizards had come out of her family. In fact her uncle, James McFraud, was the     headmaster at the school that she is going to attend, Martwardtz Academy for young witches and wizards. Every witch or wizard in her family had attended Martwardtz, it was established by one of the greatest witches that the magic world had ever seen, Henrietta Martwardtz.	After Alexia had finished her breakfast and thanked her mother, she went into the den to read a few of the books she was assigned for school. But, soon all of her thoughts were quickly interrupted when an owl came swooping down onto the table in front of her. \"Hello Angelina, you bring something for me?\" Angelina was one of the family owls; they had about twenty or so. She dropped a package and a letter on the table then flew off to the owlery downstairs. \"I wonder what this could be,\" muttered Alexia. Since it had no name on it, she didn't know whom it was from. When she opened it, she found a book with the name Vampira Dawn on the cover. \"Hmm, she thought, who is that?\" She tried to open it, but there was a lock and she couldn't seem to find the key. Thinking that maybe it wasn't meant for her, she took it to her mom. \"Mom, said Alexia, Angelina delivered this in a package this morning, it didn't say who it was to or who it was from, and it says Vampira Dawn on the cover. Do you know what it is?\" Amy was shocked when Alexia showed her the book, and a look of total horror came across her face. \"Um, Alexia, honey, I think you should go to your room and get ready for this afternoon, ok?\"Reluctantly, she obeyed and went up to her room, the entire time thinking about the book. \"I wonder what it could be?\" Suddenly, she remembered the letter that Angelina had delivered. Being very quiet she crept downstairs back into the den and got the letter, she then ran back upstairs and locked her door. The envelope said:                      Alexia Vampira Dawn                    Red hair and blue eyes                       1315 Cherry Lane	\"I wonder who it's from,\" she muttered. When she opened it, written in red ink was:                           Dear Alexia,                    You probably do not remember us, because you were just a baby when we left. This may be a shock for you and we are both very sorry. We are your parents. We don't think that we should be the ones to tell you about it since we were not the ones who have raised you for the past twelve years. The book that we sent you is a picture album. Amy knows the key.                                                                                                          With Love,                                                   Ashley and Blake Dawn	Alexia sat in silence for a moment. Maybe it just a joke, yeah, she though, that had to be it, it was just a birthday joke. She sat and stared at the letter for a long time. She realized that there wasn't anyone she knew cruel enough to play a trick this mean on her. She immediately ran down to her mother, nearly tripping over her own feet while she ran. \"Mom, mom, she screamed, what is this?\" After she read it, her mother got an immediate look of horror on her face; similar to the one she had when she saw the book. \"You know something don't you mom, said Alexia, you're not telling me? \"Why won't you tell me, she screamed, I think I should know. It say's that your not my mother!\" \"It's wrong, yelled her mother, I'm your mother! It must be a joke, it's wrong!\" With that Alexia ran up to her room, slammed the door, locked it, then flew onto her bed, and laid their for almost four or five hours.                             Chapter two	When Alexia woke up the next day, what happened that night before was still on her mind, but she still needed to get ready to leave for the airport. The term didn't start for another four days, but since Martwardtz Academy was in Britain (where all of the top witchery and wizard schools were located, she had to fly to England, and then take a train to the school) she had to leave early.After she had gotten ready and had all her school things she headed downstairs to breakfast. She still wasn't sure how she was going to handle things when she saw Amy and Sean. She sighed, \"I guess I will have to get used to calling them aunt Amy and uncle Sean.\" She set her things down in the den and then went into the kitchen for breakfast. \"Hi sweety, called aunt Amy, \"I bet your really excited about going to Mardwartz, I know I was on my first day, she said as she set her plate on the table and filled a glass with juice for Alexia. \"I'm not all that hungry, said Alexia grimly, I'm going down to the owlery to get Angelina ready.\" She quietly walked downstairs into the owlery, let Angelina out of her cage, and then sat down on a bench by the wall. \"Angelina, it must be so easy for you, you don't have to ever know your parents, you don't have to live happily for twelve years and then in ten minutes you find out that your whole life is a lie.\" Angelina lovingly nipped her on the hand then flew around before settling on Alexia's shoulder. \"I don't know what to do.\" Tears started running down her cheeks, she quickly wiped them away and went to get Angelina's cage. \"Come on girl, let's go.\" She put Angelina into her cage and went back upstairs to the den. \"I'm ready,\" she called to her aunt and uncle. \"I bet your excited, Mardwartz is one of the most wonderful places on Earth. I know you'll love it,\" Exclaimed her uncle. He grabbed her trunk and with a loud grunt he hoisted them into the trunk. \"There, he said, all packed. We better go going if you want to make your plane.\" Before they knew it, aunt Amy came running out of the house with two bags a mirror and a hairbrush, she was quickly brushing her hair as fast as she could. \"Come on Lexi, we're going to be late, we still have to go through customs, said aunt Amy, I'll see you in a week Sean.\" With that she quickly pecked him on the cheek and shut her door. She waved out the window and sped off down the street toward the busy highway."
