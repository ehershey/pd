__Letter "Here's one link I found that really sums up how it affects people.A lot of people have it.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uYdxEBda7M&feature=relatedWill try to get on later.One thing is that the doctors are trying to link this to what has happenedin my life.  It could be that because of all the things that just happened tome, that it just caught up to me and it's my body's way of slowing down.They are trying to figure out when it started.hugs"
