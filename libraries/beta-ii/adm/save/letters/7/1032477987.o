__Letter "Sleep is such a pain, isnt it?  It gave me the worst time this morning when I was trying to make up for last night.  Oh well.  I'm feeling a bit better now.  I hope you were able to sleep well after you left last night.  I've been invited to Mike's house today to set up a character for a new campaign..  yes, ANOTHER campain.  We cant seem to keep one going for any length of time.  Hopefully this one will last...  at least that's what Heath's saying.  I'll be back before midnight tonight.  Hope to see you then!  *kisses you lightly and smiles*  I've missed you, Jenna.                                 -Your Paul"
