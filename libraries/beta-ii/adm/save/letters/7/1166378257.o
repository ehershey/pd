__Letter "Ok. Whit gave me the nod so I will be finishing off the changes forbuilders. The new system will allow each builder to grant and/ordeny scan/read/write access for their files for other builders.The archwizards and administrators will still retain blanket accessto the builders files. I'm also going to be locking out the builder'srooms other then their workroom. They will have to party with theauthor of the rooms to go walking around in them once im done. Thisis to keep people from snooping around looking for hidden secrets andquest info.Ironman"
