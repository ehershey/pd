__Letter "this is a screen shot of my most recent try.It is very dark.Welcome to the Necromancer Hall. Strange shadows flood the walls the ground,allowing only several select things to be seen. Small drops of blood fall everynow and then from the ceiling into a gathering puddle of blood. Surrounded bybones of long dead creatures lies a board near the middle of the room. The smell of death fills the room.There is only one obvious exit: out.The Necromancer Board of Death < 0 Unread, 70 Posts > is here.> post necro commandsThe board is full.  You will have to remove an earlier post to make a new post."
