__Letter "If your time is going to get that limited, please let me help you more.I know we've talked on it in the past. To put it bluntly, I'm disabledand have almost unlimited time on my hands.... and more importantlyknow how to get the code to do what it needs to do.All you really need to do is leave me a grocery list of the things yawant done and check back in a few days :P It will be done or you'llhave the answers as to what the stumbling block is. Only barrier Ican forsee to my not having the time to deal with things for ya is ifi wind up in the hospitol again like i did earlier in the year...If i disapear for a few days ya know thats probably where im at :(I will however return as quickly as i can.My main focus is, and i wish it to remain, on builders and helpingthe areas coming in to be up to my standards.  I am more then willingto help over here on projects that you have a need to get completedhowever.  It's just gonna save on \"bug repair\" time if the areas comeinto the game already screened for programming errors.Im thinking of a 3 step process for the review system.1) I screen them for the programming fluidity....    In other works, I make sure the code is doing what the builder    intended it to do. I would also make sure its done in a manner    that keeps the interferance with other items to a minimum.    Example of this is the add_action() vs setting (: :) func calls    that I have already mailed you about.2) A second person, either Daos, Amun or Luna, checks thru the area     for spelling, grammer, role-playing and mud-history issues.     Also included in this step would be checking for balance issues.     I would only allow high-end gear for quest-prizes ONLY and even     then there would be a security screen built on them.3) Whit or yourself goes over the area one last time and import the     area to the game, once any errors are fixed this is.Bottom line is my primary focus is builders but im ok with helpingover here as well.Ironman"
