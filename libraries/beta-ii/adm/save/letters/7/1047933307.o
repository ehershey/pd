__Letter "Here's just a few balance things i've noticed lately.Demonfire and Chistrike (or something like that. lvl 30 monk move) always para. The paralyze component needs to be randomized (possibly a random roll plus and if then statement). Especially chistrike needs to be looked at because it can force an opponent to sit every round in addition to para. I'd recommend a random para but take out the sit component. 20% chistrike para and 60% demonfire para are my recommendations. Demonfire is a low damage move comparetively and i lose normal attacks.The main reason monks appear weak is because they test in the arena where AC changes come into affect. AC changes really need looking at because physical attacks are almost useless in the arena. Certainly slash/stab/bladedance/furystrike do nothing vs a player with decent armour. Furystrike can use a small upgrade (15% maybe), but the main issue is the AC change.I believe Hermes has a move called greater rage. Horribly overpowered. If my best friend was a berzerker i'd probably try and code something like that too. As is a berserker is the strongest fighter (once boost is taken away). Rage is already an extreemly powerful move. Greater rage would be too much.Necromancers are not weak no matter what hermes says. They are about 100% stronger than any other class at lvl 37 (they kill a 30k mob in 2 rounds vs 4-5 rounds for another class). Plus with summons they take little to no damage. I recommend limiting them to 1 summon at a time like kataan summons.Same old story as before with Demons and their moves.On the whole though everything is looking great. If Hermes works on making some new moves for the developing classes (scout, jester, ect) it'll be awesome :)-- Rubi"
