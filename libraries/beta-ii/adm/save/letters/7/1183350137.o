__Letter "for your new system of not being able to do same move over and over, i think a kind of combo would be coollike a lead strike, a followup strike, then a finishing hit, kinda a cool combo thingmaybe a kind of charm thing, that paralyzes the enemy for a number of roundssince they have enhanced senses, maybe a kind of super hearing thing, that would let them hear into the next room without going into itpossibly instead of flying, kindoff an astral projection type thingsince they are already kindoff undead, it would be cool to have a different death kindoff liek angels doa starter involving sneaking up behind them and sinking their teeth into the enemysorry for the mess of it, thats all i can think off atm"
