__Letter "basiclly for one reason or another rage isn't very useful atm, i am taking hella dmg because of the defence drop and for some reason slash has become less common, i can kill something faster using gore(weaker then slash) faster then raging and maybe gettin 2-3 slashes a combat... don't make sense, it may be because of the combat system change... but i think something is wrong there.P.S. can i have my demon abils added to rage.... not a huge priority, but plz add it to ur list"
