__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Uzamaki to Uzamaki Wed Feb 28 21:29:30 2007:-----Step 1: tell uzamaki nicknameThis will be how you get me ready to buff you.Step 2: tell uzamaki rasenganThat's the current keyword. Use this as many times as desired to get all the buffs. Note that there are only seven, so please keep the spammage down. And you must wait for the next round for more.Step 3: If my mp is too low to continue buffing:1. give me a stone and tell me 'crudbuckets'   OR2. give me some ashes and tell me 'sprinklememan'All the keywords must be spelled as listed.And now, for the glory of darksoul, feel free to enjoy DEEZ.Uza"
