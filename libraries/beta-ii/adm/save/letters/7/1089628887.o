__Letter "I hate to e-mail you again..but sorry there are somethings i need to get off my chest..one thing...no relationship is perfect...as anyone i know..or you know for that matter, it take time and effort for one to work .  And if you love the person then that should be the motivation .Work will come and go...but to let love slip you by????  Life is too short to take anything for granted.The second part...well ...put it this way..its sad to hear people say...not daniel..someone else whomi wont name but this person has seen us together and knew we were together.  That this personnotice how you ignored me ..even from the beginning.  That hurt to hear..but it had to be said.Third yes i did do some bad things...and so have you.  This letter isnt to get you back or anything like that its to get you to stop thinkingand to listen to your own words that is the last thing i want you take.I took alot of shit from you,  i dont deny that...and i have given it right backbut its interesting how you were and how things changed.In way i think you are like me were you like that chase but when its over then nothingall you care is about is yourself..not about someone else's well being.  You only think about whenyou can eat or when you can sleep, totally disregarding the other person's feelings.It hurts yes, but i rather take that then suffer some more.  You dont know how to treat someone and i will sorry for the girl who comes after me.  And im obiviously not getting my stuff back so till i see you nexti have good one and enjoy life because sure in the end you will be stable and will be able to retirebut you will be alone.  I rather have love any day than being well off to do..Sincerely,Amy M Koga."
