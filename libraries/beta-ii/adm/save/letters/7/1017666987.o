__Letter "What is up with that. You are being friendly, and then I agree with someone on an issue and suddenly you tell me to STFU and that all I ever do is complain and so on. Come on Faust, I was only saying something used to be a problem, i.e. it isn't anymore, and asked if something could be changed. A request is not a complaint. A complaint is when I tell someone they did something wrong.	- Aziraphale"
