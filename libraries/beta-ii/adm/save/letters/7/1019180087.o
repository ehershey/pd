__Letter "bloodrink - similar to backstab, the vampire drinks blood from an enemy.  Only way to \"quench\" their thirst since they don't drink alchohol.  Bloodrink should be a mix of charisma and stealth, since they would probably try to sneak past the target's defense AND seduce them into a sense of security.shadowdance - Only usable at night, the vampire blends with the shadows.  Accuracy, perception, evasion, etc. increase.nightcloak - Cloak usable only at night.ailmentbreath - Vampires are immune to poisons or diseases but can still 'catch them'.  They can breathe out a massive wind containing all of their collected viruses/diseases/poisons on a room and infect everyone in it.darker - The vampire \"prays\" to mother night and the room becomes darker.  Usable only at night, it's useful because while other races might not be able to see, the vampire can see in any darkness.deathaura (%^YELLOW%^my favorite one!%^RESET%^) - A deathless of old age (the vampire should age considerably in mud years, at least 5) and power (very high level) can use this ability.  Their aura swells and and explodes outward, an invisible growing sphere that attempts to kill all life.  The effects would be instakill.  The chances would be based on level, different to each lifeform in the area.  For those it didn't instakill, it would do 0 damage.  seduce- increases chances of successfuly bloodrinkingbind - A number of shadows lash out and suspend a target.  The effectiveness is partially based on the quality of the darkness in the room. bonebreak - (room for an 'anatomical knowledge' skill) The vampire looks for a particularly weak part of the targetted limb and hits it for low damage and good body damage.Extra racial specials------------------1.) Vampires can hear the heart beat of anyone who enters under their enter message.  The heartbeat message is a reflection of their remaining hp, so the heart beat's \"fast, extremely fast, slow, etc\" based on their hp/sp.2.) Vampires can smell the blood of anyone who enters.  If they've tasted that race's blood before, they smell \"(race) blood\".  If not, they smell \"unfamiliar blood.\"3.) The previous two specials apply to cloaked people as well, they can still hear the heartbeat and smell the blood of invisible people.4.) Ability to hear whispers during the night.5.) Few to none of their abilities work outdoors during the day.  They don't heal either.  The natural heal works indoors but lots of their abilities depend on outdoor night.6.) Can see in any dark.7.) Heaps of HP per level and con.  If not both, at least level.  Perhaps their HP could just increase a lot during the night.I don't expect all of these ideas to go in but I think they're really cool and balanced.  They have really fun abilities to use during the night and while they're the sitting ducks of sitting ducks during the day, they'll still have minor abilities indoors to defend themselves.8.) Forgot to include this one.  Their natural healing ability.  They are immune to healing magic and oils and ANY other kind of healing other than their natural one.  If they are healed any other way, it's bug exploitation.  Anyway, they could heal around 20% a round during the night and either heal nothing during the day or take a bit of damage from the sun."
