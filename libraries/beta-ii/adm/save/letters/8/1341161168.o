__Letter "Sorry nobody's been around, most of us are in the US.Quests are completed automatically when you do the last part,whatever that may be. There is no questmaster where you hand thingsin like on some muds. It's possible you may hand something in tosomeone depending on the quest, but there's no single start orend point for all quests in general."
