__Letter "Dear Forlorn Greek God,Two words.. \"snip snip\"  If you really want her badly enough you'll do anything to make her happy, however I would suggest you taking a look at other options within the realm.  There has to be at least one single, straight, natural girl out there.  If not.. I hear Hermes is looking for new playthings.  After the last edition uncovering all those awful truths about him I'm sure he'll take just about anyone.Good luck to you,Sugarlove"
