__Letter "It's not real life that caused me to change guilds, I didn't even want to join darksouls, but you know what, you don't care, so I won't give the real reason why.To think of all the work I put into that guild, knowing the whole time you had power to remove me whenever you felt like it.  I can kick myself in the ass now.  But, I'll chalk it up to lesson learned and move on."
