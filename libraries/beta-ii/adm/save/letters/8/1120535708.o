__Letter "Whit,How are you doing..  let me cut down to business.I think Primal Darkness is an incredibly cool MUD, but as it is, it seems kind of broken.You've probably heard this proposal again and again but I think it is different coming from me since I have been honest with you since the beginning.I would like to become a member of staff to enforce the rules/law.  I will give up any player characters for myself, exclusively doing my job.  I only work 4 hours a day this summer and have no friends because University is out.  I have nothing to do.  I KNOW I can do this job well if you have faith in me.In the future, I think the mud would benefit from a player wipe so that everyone is on an equal playing field.  At the point of the wipe, changes to balance and guilds and game mechanics could be ironed out.  I really think this could work.  Please reply to me so we could discuss it.Levi"
