__Letter "I forgot the other reason I was imm. A player got completely bugged up and could not issue commands because the call_out for paralyze was lost. So she was permenantly para'd, as she was trying to do the angel quest. I could have fixed that pretty much straight away, but as it is, we need to wait hours and hours so the imms/admins, who all live in america, finally wake up :|That's why it's good for me to be there too, so that people with probs can usually get them sorted out right away.And if you guys ever want someone active to like, you know:Standardize spells and abilities.Fix race modsFix spell/abil bugsAnd all that stuff that players have been asking after forever, then yeah I can do that if you guys'll let me.Tis all."
