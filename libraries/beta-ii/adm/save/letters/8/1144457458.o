__Letter "Is it possible, with the other changes that you're making, to make it so that a player can't initiate combat with someone that they've killed in the last 120 hours (or that has killed them) to have a hard coded enforcement of the 5 day wait rule?Also, as part of this, perhaps a function like pk_ok() or something, where you can pass this_player() to it so combat skills can see if it's ok to hit the player or not."
