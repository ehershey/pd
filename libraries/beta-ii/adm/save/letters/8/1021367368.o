__Letter "     It has come to light, at long last - that there is no way I will be able to maintain a regular schedule here. There are several other problems that have only festered. Namely; there is no appreciation for any sort of design, and little if any respect from anyone. I was given the title of Law... as of yet i have been charged with no legal action (this was true even was i was here every night for 10 hours straight. so let's not kid ourselves about how i havent been here lately.) It appears i am not really needed. Then there is the Daos situation which bothers me a lot. So I resign as Law. You can leave Danovae here as the lowest possible immortal, or you can demote to player - either is fine. I will still try to be here when I can. It's been fun.     I do apologize for any incovenience.    I will try to get ahold of you sometime when you aren't idle, this week.Danovae"
