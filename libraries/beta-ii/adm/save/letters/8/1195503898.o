__Letter "OK now.I have several nice sample items coded. Cortoth said he'll becoding some too. When can you come check em out ??If you wish to do so on your own and mail me back do thefollowing;   1) call me;add_search_path;\"/cmds/iron_senses\"   2) goto /wizards/cortoth/iron_senses/experimental_room.c   3) clone anything in /wizards/cortoth/iron_senses   4) feel, smell, taste, listen to, examine, look, and read      the objects.The system is fully functional and working as designed now.I worked out the bugs for the (: :) pointers. That wasnt partof the original system. I added them when i brought it to PD.Mail me back with your thoughts on the sample objects."
