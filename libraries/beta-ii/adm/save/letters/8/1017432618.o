__Letter "The sun set in the west, like a normal evening. Darkness filled the lands.All the residents of the town of Tirun settled into their beds, feelingsafe at the end of a hard days work. The guards of Tirun stood at theirposts, making sure nobody was harmed by the chaos that raged outside the city.In an alley rarely used by normal people, a single rogue starts to secretlytunnel out the beginnings of his hideout. He wonders if anybody has seen him,no-one he hopes. This is the first member of the Dark Souls.Early in the morning, the first member finished his work and climbed thebuilding he has tunneled under to rest on the roof and watch the town. A strange man wanders the land, his body being wracked by unseen forces.Hearing voices in his head, doing things of evil to silence them, he falls in love with a beautiful woman, whom eventually leads him to find the darkest side of the soul. His body burns and twists as his once half-elf form is destroyed and replaced with that of a demon. He notices two smaller demons sitting on his shoulders whispering into his ears. These are his voices, these are the things that drove him to insanity. Staggering aboutin his insanity, he stumbled apon the gates of Tirun. The guards, afraidof this new creature, decided to attack it. The second member grinned thenlaughed, as the guards attacked. Within seconds, every member of the town guard stoodheadless, their souls dragged into the depths of hell. The first member watched this battle from his rooftop and called out to thestrange creature. Telling the creature about his plans for the world, the creature agreed to help the first member with his quest. In exchange, thefirst member offered the creature a place to hide and feed.Thus the second member was added.Together, these two people called themselves Dark Souls.Hows that?"
