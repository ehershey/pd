__Letter "Hey lady. :) I have been thinking of coding an area for a longwhile now. I'd be more than happy to pass it on to someone elseas my coding skills are next to nil, heh. It would be a mountainnear the mainland. Somewhere in the Daroq mountains. I'd want thereto be mythical creatures there along vampire lore a la Brian Lumleywho is my favorite author. He would have vampires take their flesh,which is highly metamorphic, and fashion flyers and warriors and siphoneers and all kinds of stuff. So, it'd be like the Transylvaniamountains of myth with perhaps some werewolves, vampires...even astray unicorn maybe that would be rideable! And the higher you go upthe mountain, the tougher the foes would get. This would let so manydifferent ranges of players xp in the same general areas. I'd also want them roaming. I suppose that's pretty much it. Of course, moreideas are easy to manufacture along this scheme for me. :)Later,James"
