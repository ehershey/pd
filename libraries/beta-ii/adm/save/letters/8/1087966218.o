__Letter "I have a request. My boyfriend (aziraphale) usually gets equipment and stuff for me when I need it, but now that I'm living with him and there's only one computer here, he can't do that or it would be considered multiplaying. Everybody knows that we're not the same player (ask pretty much any imm you want-Azire, Venenum, Helena, or any player), so could we please have the multiplay rules between mine and his character lifted?My characters are Jacie and Scourge, and his only one is Aziraphale. I just want to make it clear that I'm not asking for permission to multiplay with my characters, just when it's *either* Jacie and Aziraphale or Scourge and Aziraphale online. It would be greatly appreciated, and could you let me know if/when you do it? ThanksJacie"
