__Letter "We don't have requirements on level unless you want to impose that.  You have to get to know the people before you add them, we need to be able to trust that they're not just some throwaway character.  Also, they have to be an evil or neutral class.  No white dragons, or holy magic users, etc.No archangels.  (Unless we can find some way to convert them to fallen angels through the unholy, that would rock.)"
