__Letter "In case you login whilst i am not able to talk with you.  I would just like to say a few things.Recently, i have gone out.  and i have inducted a few new acolytes into the guild.  Nulvect is a powerful new ally.  As is Tauran..  Now, i know Tauran is an archangel, but i assure you.  he is dedicated to our cause, just the same as I.  Mayhaps not to the same extent of pleasing Asmodeus.  But he will serve our whims.Also, other...not as pronounced acolytes have been joined into the guild.  Incidentally, many are other assassins.  Some wishing to be looked upon with Favour in Asmodeus' eyes and becoming one of his Demons, such as myself.  They may not be very powerful now.  But they know not to dissapoint me.  They know i'll dispense of them otherwise.There is still one more assassin that will be soon part of our force, however for the time being.  He is taking advantage of other sources to further his own ambitions.  but he is on our side.  As well as a sorceror, who is decently strong currently...but in need of some considerable training still.  He will be with us as well in some time.As for now...i believe that is all the updating required..---However, there is one or two more matters to discuss...  promotions.I believe that Nulvect and Tauran ought to both me promoted to Black Knight.  Nulvect is a strong imp.  And Tauran is a devilish Angel if there ever was one.However...Between you and me.  Do not promote Tauran to the point where he has say who can be inducted into Unholy...I do not yet trust his judgement in that area as of yet.  not 100% at least.(Plus, i figure im doing a good enough job at current, slowly building our ranks)---And lastly..  I'm curious of the condition of the Heirchial levels of the guild(level names.  Black Knight, Twisted Sister etc.)  and whether you'd like me to pester some imms about it or not.And to add with that...Any news on Leviathas?  if he's ever going to resurface?  (he may be in for a suprise when he does, he may see an active guild in front of him.) ---Oh, sorry.  one last note.  I know i would like to add onto the guild eventually.. So if there are any certain parameter's you'd like to have followed...perhaps a post on the Unholy Board would be in order?  so that both I and other willing workers would be able to construct fitting rooms and such things.no pressure on gettin that done right away though. Im still waiting on the final verdict on Guild Items before i start goin code happy.---Regards,~*~ Bellos - Recruiter to the Armies of Evil ~*~"
