__Letter "sorry it has taken me so long to get around to this, but here's a rough draft, let me know if I'm on the right path, or need better directions...The long sloping hallway leads downward and deeper into the dark shadows.  A soft amber light creeps down the walls with long streaching fingers guiding the way further in.  Shadows hunger for fresh prey, but are held obiedent to the strange light above.  A gem illuminating around a large form trapped inside.  This seems to be a place of worship.I'll fix typos later....LOOKSHallway - it leads underneath an upturned long finger.Shadows - They are transfixed to the light above while gathering in the shadows of which the form inside creates.Light - The actual source of light seems to be generated by the gem itself.Walls - ?Gem - Amber in color and is a source of light.  A large form at first seems to looked trapped inside, but looking again, it seems to be a resting place.Form - A female demon, with her wings folded around her as she slumbers inside the gem.crap....Light - The actual source of light seems to be generated by the gem itself.  A large form inside casts long shadows that look like a hand ready to snatch away something precious.Like I said, it's only a rough draft, please let me know if this is along the lines of what you are looking for, or if you had a different vision.  I await for your guidelines.Hep"
