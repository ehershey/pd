__Letter "Well guess what. I started learning Annarian. *grin* I had some extra xp after levelling up and training skills so I decided to start a new language. Notice  Isaid start. Dang, how olong does it take to learn a language? I'm still at the \"learning\" status. Well, anyway, I plan to spend some time on it every once in a while. Your buddy was there, too. Drakule or Prator, whoever it was. Anyway, hope to see you soon!*Savannah kisses you passionately and steals her hand down to your manhood before pulling away and giving you a sexy wink goodbye. ~p"
