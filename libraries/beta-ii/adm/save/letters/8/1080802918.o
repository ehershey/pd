__Letter "I just had a whole deal with agent/a shadow. The best way for me to explain it to you is just to get you to read illum board--it's the last 3 posts on there, unless someone's replied to them already.My question is, given my story stated on the illuminati board, with Bellos' quote and Keirith witnessing the quote repeated over illuminati line, is that evidence enough to prove that he (agent) was the shadow that pked me? I don;'t have anything logged because I just have telnet, so I can't, but Jon should have it in his logs when get gets back online because he keeps his character on all teh time. Also I could see if I could get Bellos to repeat what he said. And as I said I have Keirith as my witness for the quote repeated over illuminati chat line.If there is a harassment case here, what's it gonna do to him? Please tell me it's more than just a slap on the wrist. :(Btw, I'll try to get Jon to save his logs of that quote if he still has them (which he should). Then if you want I guess he can mudmail it to you if needed.Thanks :)Jacie"
