__Letter "Hey Beautiful, sorry I wasn't on much yesterday and I'm sorry that you aren't feeling too good. I wish you had my immunities for a day or something because I hardly ever get sick and whenever I do get sick I'm never down for more than a day unless it's really bad. I'm going to miss you while I'm gone, yes unfortunatly I'm getting ready to leave soon. If there's any way I can talk to you try to tell arma to call my cell phone, 615-554-3438, and then I'll call you off of it. I hope you get better soon so that when I get back we can definatly talk. *hugs and kisses* I hope you have sweetdreams and good days while I'm gone. I love you Beautiful.Forever and Always yours,Josh"
