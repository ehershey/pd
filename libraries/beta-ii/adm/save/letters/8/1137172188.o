__Letter "The rule makes an analogy to chess, where the specific member of a guild who is killed in guild versus guild conflict is removed from the board, safe from a second death for five days.  This rule no longer applies to the entire guild, though, so other conflicts may be resumed.  I believe that that rule is fairly clear on this point, but I'm going to be a bit more flexible until they're set in stone, because I appreciate that a transition is difficult.  At the same time, because Vyce was playing correctly under the new rule, I wont be issuing a punishment.Thank you.Levi"
