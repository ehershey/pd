__Letter "Yo, so I log in and Perel says hi. We talk briefly and he asks forbuffs. I gave Rohl buffs the other day because he said he wouldavoid you and I wanted to encourage good will. Well, he asked for some for Perel. I told him the ban still wasn't lifted and alsosuggested he give you time. I send a tell and intercept a reply:Perel replies: so fuck him and fuck uzi, i'll kill them bothYou reply to Perel: so cuz I dont give u buffs, u wanna kill me, huh? :)Perel replies: the only reason freddie has the confidence to hold a grudge withme is cause of you :PYou reply to Perel: you dont know Freddie.You reply to Perel: I've known Freddie about 8 yearsYou reply to Perel: HE DOES NOT BACK DOWNPerel replies: Well in hindsight thenYou reply to Perel: I gotta admit, I feel a bit disappointed.timePerel replies: Yea it was cool that we were buds for a few years. but if youwant to just sit back and armor up your little buddy for battle with me, thatsyour problem. Its hard to be pals when you got that goin onYou reply to Perel: I am whatcha call loyal tyo my guild.You reply to Perel: I dont cut and run because someone I dont like is in it.You reply to Perel: and then run again because I wasnt promoted back up fastenoughYou reply to Perel: I still love ya, but that's a crap attitude.Perel replies: yep aryan uziPerel replies: there is no love. you dont even talk to me really, you just makesmartass comments that leave me dodging conversation.You tell Perel: I always greeted you. You hardly ever responded. Then when youdo, seems there's always asking for buffs involved. But I try not to take itpersonal.Perel replies: I think i'm just losing it in my desperation. I dont have muchto play for anymore and therefor I get pissed off and aggitatedSo he tries to clean it up way late. We'll see what we see, but I guess peace talks are cancelled. :DUza"
