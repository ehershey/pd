__Letter "Hello, love. I have got to head to class soon. I saw that youstayed on in the event I should see you. I was so happy to see you, you have no idea. :) But then I learned you were real idle. :( But I said 'lemme send this mail' and then said 'great idea'.While I argued over myself as to who gets credit for this, I decided it didn't matter but what matterred was showing you thatI care and you're missed. Two more big assignments due which Iplan to tackle tomorrow. I still anticipate plenty of Rayna timetho or at least major Rayna time after Wednesday. :) I hope allis well with the family. Please take care of them and yourself.I will see you when I do. :)Love,Your Ax, your James, your whoever. :)"
