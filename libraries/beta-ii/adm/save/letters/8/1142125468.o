__Letter "Cortoth and myself have been discussing the ranking system in depth and have decided the following;1) Members who are inactive for over 45 days will be moved to       Dragon Warrior.  This is NOT a reflection on the person      mearly a fact that Knights and Dragoons will have more      active rolls shortly. As a result, we need active players      in those levels.2) We will not demote anyone until April 1, 2006 to give them a      chance to become more active in our guild. If you do get      moved down and wish to take a more active role, then please      speak to Cortoth or myself about moving back up.3) Once we have our roster settled, Cortoth and i will be defining      the roles of Dragoon and Dragon Knight.4) Dragon Warrior will basically be for the retired members or       members who are just getting to know us. Ironman --Dragon Master"
