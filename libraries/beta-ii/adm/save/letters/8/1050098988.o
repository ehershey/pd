__Letter "Hey there. Argh, i got home today and my dad was already home!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.....I really hate it when he gets home early. But anyway, he barely even gave me 5 seconds peace before he barked \"Trash. Now. And when you get done change into work clothes to change the oil.\" God i hate it when he does that. \"Well hello to you too, Dad!\"  *angry scowl*Sorry, i'm just pretty pissed off right now. But it looks like i won't get my mud time in after all. I should be on ICQ by 5 at the latest, but no telling what else he's gonna find for me to do. I was so looking forward to some time alone mudding this afternoon. but no, he just *had* to come home early. GRrrrrrrr........Okay well I'll stop complaining now. I gotta go do chores anyway. Grrrr.....I love you,Heather"
