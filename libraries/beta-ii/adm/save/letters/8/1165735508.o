I would be happy to help in any way I can.  I was going to contact you anyway, and offer your customers some free hosting to help them transition.  I just hadn't figured out the offer yet.  Free signup, certainly, and no billing until february was what I was thinking.  That would give them Dec & Jan for free, depending on when they move over.If you have any ideas, or offers that you think might be better received, I would be glad to hear them.  Anyway, I don't mind doing what I can to help, I can setup temporary 1mth accounts at no charge for folks that don't know what to do yet or who cant make a financial commitment before you shut your doors and need a place to park their mud for a bit.Regards,Gary"
