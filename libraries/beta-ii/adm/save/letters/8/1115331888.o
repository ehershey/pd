__Letter "downdownnorthwestWell, since you don't seem to have even been on since you mailed me, you can ignore that last mail... I work at least part of this upcoming weekend (5/7 for sure), and next weekend my grandparents are coming home from AZ, and one of them is sick, so I definitely won't be available then. I'm really not sure what my work week is going to be like next week, but I'm usually on sometime around 3-8 PM most week nights."
