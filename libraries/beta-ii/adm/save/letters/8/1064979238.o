__Letter "Is it possible for Illuminati to buy out Acheron and use it as a subguild to trial new members? It would work as a funky alliance thing. Illuminati members can listen to both lines, but people in subguild can only listen to one line.For guild leaders... linking them up would prolly be difficult. Unless some 'if(query_guild() == \"illuminati\") set_sub_guild(\"soldat\");' stuff was done. If that is too much work, then I'd probably just make an alt to control that guild.But yeah, I think I can come up with the code to allow guilds to have a subguild.Sound any good?"
