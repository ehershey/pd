__Letter "That's nice, but it's a bit coincidental. I'll let you have it, I don't care.You pretty much gave it out, sure xxx.x.x.x could be anything, but anyone who has the slightest clue about what were even talking about would most likely guess that, especially with your current title change, which just happened to come coincidentally after you made that post, or at least around the same time. In any event, a) wiz doesn't play, he just has a screened tt++ client on server1.tekgenesis.net, which is located on a rack in a datacenter miles from the both of us. He almost never bothers attaching to that screen (I'm at this point assuming you have some Unix knowledge), and even when he did live with me, he never attached to it then either. Never is an overstatement, he did occasionally, it was just very rare. I think it's pretty obvious to everyone. In any event, it was no one's business that I mud from the same host that wiz is connected from. That is something that if you got as an imm, you shouldn't have shared with the public. Yes, you didn't say it was localhost, saying xxx.x.x.x didn't really help the situation, though. But just the fact that you stated that I was connected from the same host wiz connects from was wrong, I hope you can somehow acknowledge that.As for the spy thing with you and Jacie? Whether you did it for shits-n-giggles or not, the fact of the matter still stands, you (or her) were in fact trying to get a spy into their guild. No matter what your motive, it's still wrong to do that. Jacie knows I am not going to report you or her to admins for this. Yes, I stated that Illuminati has been trying to get spies into forsaken, it hasn't been just Jacie, I've personally known other Illuminati members who admitted to me, the same as your girlfriend, that they were attempting, and maybe actually succeeded at getting a spy into Forsaken. I would never repeat who said what. The only reason I am able to bring up the fact with you, is because you knew about Jacie, since you both \"plotted\" it, so I have no problem discussing it with you. In any event, as I said, no matter what the motive, it's still not right to do what you (Jacie) were planning on doing. You're free to disagree with that, of course, but that's just my opinion, and the opinion of <help rules> apparantly.As far as the scripting thing is concerned, you got yourself involved into me bringing this up. I made no references to you whatsoever, from the getgo. My post was entirely about Helena, and Tyste (barely). You posted in response, pointing fingers at me and eveyone else. Sharing information about me, that no one on this mud had the right to know, except for Immortals and Admins. So you brought yourself into it. Why does everyone think you script while afk? I'll tell you. A lot of people seem to think that when you've \"hung out\" with them IRL, you get a little drunk or...carefree, and let them in on your little secrets. There are people on this mud (I won't name who), who seem to think that you were bragging to them about how Nightshade just gave you a mere slap on the wrist and you pretty much got away with scripting the time(s) that you did. I got all my scripting information about you from players, not imms/admins. Sorry to burst whatever bubble you had. I promised the 2 players that had told me all these things that I wouldn't relay anything, and I'm already pushing that promise by telling you how I know what I know. I'm sorry, but I refuse to name names.My original post on the newbie board wasn't really pointing fingers. It was mostly just stating possibilities, and stating my FEELINGS. I also said a lot of positive things about Helena, and I made sure that the post didn't bash anyone. It didn't. Your \"response\" was VERY bashful, and you gave out personal information that you shouldn't have. You can deny it all you want, but you did in fact script while afk at least once. That is why you lost imm, or so it was stated. You'll carry that stigma with you for a while, I personally, don't care. The only reason I backlashed at you, was because you decided to bring yourself into this. That's all. I kept every personal detail that I know about eveyrone (including you, Jacie and Helena) out of all my posts. Why? Because, as I told Jacie, the personal things that I know about everyone was told to me in the strictest of confidence on our personal friendships. There is a difference (to me) between Kumi (a player on PD), and Jen (my real life self). The second people start talking to me on a personal level, they're talking to Jen, not Kumi. As skitzo as that sounds, that's just the way it is. This is just a game, I'm not out to hurt anyone.You and I both know that most of the mud are probably just scratching their head about all this. Your and my dispuit anyway. I deleted my posts. Not because I've changed my opinions, or think I'm wrong, but because there's no point in me having the posts there. It benefits no one, and just drums up a lot of unnecessary conflict, which drags the fun straight out of mudding here, for me anyway. I'm completely spent with this situation, you know how I feel about all this (or at least I think you do, because I just wrote you a _very_ long mudmail), so that's basically it. We're not gonna see eye to eye on this, so there's no point in dragging it on. Let's try to just agree to disagree on this and continue playing as if nothing happened.Take Care,Jen"
