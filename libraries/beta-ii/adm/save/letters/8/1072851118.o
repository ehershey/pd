__Letter "As far as I can tell, getting a guild to PK an individual over and over is harassment right? Well in the space of a week and a half Seth, Kai (four times), Eios, Gabriel, Scoff, Throth, Galdur and Odysseus have all tried to PK me (iniated attack, that is, I can't tell how many are scrying or cloaked) or successfully PKed me. Clearly this is super harassment... the only thing I've done to them is kill Scoff, and that was in self defense as he attacked me first while I was exping and my attack hit him. Some of those are alts, too, which I thought was illigal... what's the deal with this? I just want them to stop trying to PK me, that's all."
