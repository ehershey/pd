__Letter "Gab... i got some serious respect for you. your one of the few fighters who isnt full of shit and complaining all the time.And just so you know i can make an elite in about 12 hours so if you tell this to artanis/aziraphale i'm gonna make one and kill you. just word of warning hehe.The key to fighters is skills. a fighter under lvl 50 is only normal compared to any other class. At lvl 50 you will get the last of your normal attacks. skills have the largest impact on these hits (5 for you as angel). Stats in general are not especially useful. some con for staying alive. some dex because it adds sp (slash). If slash is really str based then it would be the important stat to raise but for all intents and purposes you will not use abilities at all. the name of the game is normal attacks. level and raise skills and thats all you ever need. weapon specials are level based as well. diamond bladed longswords (better special damage than starscream and thus better swords) do normal + 20 + level for damage on specials.The key to being buff is in skills. With Ashram part 2 (raknid paladin) i had very low stats but my level was over double everyone else's with the exception of a very few people. its all about skills.The other thing that will make you deadly is your reflexes. set short aliases to slash. dont bother with stun in arena. open with slash always because damage is what matters. if your fast then your set. it makes you seem stronger than you really are.Of course i would recommend not playing well and playing like a piece of shit like i do now. if you play fast you get downgraded. end of story. i made 6 elites and every single one got downgraded. My advice would be to lvl to 50 (normal attacks and roston/temple will give full exp) and then save 1 billion exp and use it all to power level. people dont notice your strong until you've leveled and then suprise! you dominate.Best of luck to you. and remember my warning about telling those 2... they ruin this mud with their whinning"
