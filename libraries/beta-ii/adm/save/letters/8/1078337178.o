__Letter "After an update a week or two ago to the guilds, the illuminati treasury file (/d/guilds/illuminati/treasury.c) was an exact copy of ethereal's treasury.  they were two separate rooms, but both were an ethereal treasury.  I changed the illuminati file to be an actual illuminati treasury, and fixed the exits to go back to the illuminati hall.  I dont know what the description was or if you have a backup, so for now the room is modified just enough to be useful.  You may want to look into it.                        -Nightshade"
