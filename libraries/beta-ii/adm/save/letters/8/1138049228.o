__Letter "I should let you know I don't count xp rates of such vastly different level characters as any indication of balance. The xp cuts were designed to slow down higher level players from growing too fast, and your data only shows that this is wrking in some small way. And I'm afriad the data on the damage dealt to the 2 players is virtually useless because of the variation in stats/skills and possibly level that the 2 may have. I appreciate actual data, but unless you have a control, it doens't do me much good.Thank you for your time.Daboura"
