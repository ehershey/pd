__Letter "This is just my comments on the ideas given for the vamps: STRENGTHS  ----------------------------------  - +50 hp per level/constitution    * Wayyyy to much.  level 50 with     60 con would be 150k hp...     I'd go for a 150% hp bonus, though   - 20% of vitals healed per round  naturally.   * 10 seconds to go to full hp     from 0 is too fast.  5-10     percent, depending on the     weaknesses.   - gets same penalty for losing  a battle, but never 'dies', as  death spares their body and   takes them back to his palace.   * No problem.   - great night vision.    * No problem.   - immune to poisons/diseases or  any form of bodily decay.    * No problem.     WEAKNESSES  ---------------------------------  - regenerative abilities are  useless during the day, unless  indoors.   * No problem.   - all outdoors during the day  is too bright to see in.    * Might be a little too      much..  perhaps make things     just brighter?   - almost all abilities are   useless/ineffective in daylight   * definately   - vampires gain counts for  killing, but anyone can kill  them without punishment   (not only are they monsters,  but never actually \"die\".)   * A little harsh, but will     keep the vamp population     under control   - upon first coming into  contact with sun (i.e, dawn,  or stepping outside) they  suffer 50% damage.   * I'm not really sure how     that would work...     if they were damaged every     time they left an \"indoors\"     room, it'd be too much.     I dont know how to code it     otherwise, though   - particularly weak against  turn, but not ridiculously so.   * No problem.   - no easy heavy damage attacks,  they have to pump massive   amounts of effort to achieve  this.   * Up to you, Stormy.  I     dont do balance ;)   - everyone gets blood points,  which don't normally drain.  A vampire must drink someone  else's blood to replenish  theirs, which drains at 2 BP  per minute when they're moving  fast, and 5 bp/minute when  they are battling.  It would  not drain when they were  standing still.    BP would = constitution.    A vampire's natural healing  freezes when they hit 0 BP,  their stats are all temporarily  halved.   * Interesting idea..     (played vampire: the masquerade?)     What's there is a little     complex code-wise.  How's this:     You can \"feed\" off of corpses,     and you get BP for it (we could     even give BP according to mob     level)  BP could then be used     in vamp spells/abils to buff them     up, or have BP be required to use     them ie. to turn into a bat, it     takes 2 BP"
