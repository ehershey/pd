__Letter "\"Fking\" is not allowed on newbie. You were gagged for a reason.I won't gag you at the moment, but if you can't follow the rulesand wind up gagged again and then cide to get around it,I will have only one last thing I can do. I would prefer that youwatch your language and/or use the mature line. Yes, you have toget to level 5... big deal. You can do that in 10 minutes I'm sure."
