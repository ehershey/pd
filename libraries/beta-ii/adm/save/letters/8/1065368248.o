__Letter "i'm always impressed by your ability to take control of a situation. That crap on the tirun board was going totally out of hand - and then you post .. and its silenced. I was looking at dates for your break. I start training for my new job on the 13th. things could be pretty busy - but if you dont mind being alone in the apartment a lot, then it may not be a problem. *puff* anyway, i'll be at home today working on yet another school project. I'm sorry the phonecall has been put off, Alex has been calling and calling and calling ... so i turned it off for a bit. (he's getting a bit scary, obsessive like.) at any rate, i'll hopefully get to give you that overdue phonecall tomorrow (Being monday). ttyl, *smooch*~jenna"
