__Letter "No problem,  Another good thing is to eat healthy foods, plenty of veggies and protein. Stay away from medications, including pain killers, as much as possible(im sure you've heard this before). Start excercising as soon as possible, nothing strenous or anything like that, but cardiovascular things like the treadmill, running, anything that gets the blood flowing. A healthy body  =healthy milk."
