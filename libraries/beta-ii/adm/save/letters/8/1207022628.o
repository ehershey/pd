__Letter "No forgiveness is necessary.  You didn't know and yes, part of it wasthat I didn't want to worry you.  My brothers and Dad feel helpless as welland I don't always tell them when I'm not feeling well, because I don't likemaking people worry.  Sometimes I keep it to myself too much and thatis probably why I got sick.  It's not your fault, so don't feel guilty and remove those nightmares fromyour life.  I will try to come on, that is really the reason why I do come on (even whenI'm not supposed to) - and it's because I want to be with you.  You makemy day brighter, you make me laugh and you help me through all of this.I also don't want to come into our relationship with a lot of baggage andI'm trying to leave it behind me.I know I have to attend counselling, because I can't handle all that hadhappened by myself.  I know I have you to talk to about it, but I don'twant all of that to overshadow getting to know you and what a wonderfulperson you are.Don't be sorry, you did nothing wrong.  I want to be stronger for youand I will be.  It just seemed that tiredness has a way of creeping upon a person and a few times I've fallen asleep while I was eating, sothat's not good either.  LOL Hope to talk to you later.  I will come on during the day tomorrow andI'll just stay on for awhile and if you can come on, that would be wonderful.  Maybe we could xp or even just talk.  Until then, I'll thinkof you.  I am going to call the computer place and see if they cansuggest a driver for the microphone.  Love,Your Raynakiss hug"
