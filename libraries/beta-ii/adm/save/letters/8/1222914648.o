__Letter "Dragon Warriors was given over a months time to become more active.  As stated on the board, today, October 1st, was the deadline to do so.  Unfortunately, the guild is still inactive and will no longer remain open.  Provided that the player base grows, the guild may be allowed to reopen, but as no owner, leader, or member stepped up to gain more active members, Nulvect and I decided it was time for the guild to close.  I do apologize.Amun"
