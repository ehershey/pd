__Letter "more ideas will come i'm sure but here are these for the time beingGuilds Ideas:- I would like to bring back guild dues to see which guilds are going to be active.  The only difference is, this time the only one that can pay these guild dues will be the guild owner...and I want to make them more often for less money.  I am not bringing these back to bankrupt guilds, I'm bringing them back to find out who's here to play and who's here to just pay guild dues.  I would change it to 1000 gold coins every 2 mudweeks, that way they're not not losing a lot of money, and it's more often than monthly so i can find out quicker who's here and who's not. 	If the guild does not pay 2 weeks in a row, the guild will be on probation. The guild will be notified and the guild owner will be mudmailed seperately as well.  If this happens, the guild will have 1 more mudmonth to get in order..if the guild owner only shows up to pay the dues then leaves within a 10 mins period of time..that is not showing activness and they will be replaced.	What I would LIKE to do is not have a guild auction b/c not everyone has money on the game...but instead have a intra-guild vote on who the guild collectively wants as the guild owner.  If this happens then if one guild owner leaves, we dont have the whole \"can i be leader can i be leader?\" business and it's a more fair way of deeming a leader.- Guild items:	I think that all guilds should be allowed to choose from 3 itmes each from a list of weapons and armour, with this all would be pretty much useless compared to other things...but they would have the option of having either 1 decent piece of armour OR 1 decent piece of weaponry...not both  	Armour:		Bracers		Sash		Tattoo		Quiver		Body Armour		Leggings/centaur leggings		ring		Bag/backpack		helmet	Weapons:		any 3 kinds of weapons w/ special not over powered of course- As far as what is allowed inside a guild hall, I think room wise the only things that should be allowed is:		- Main room with board		- Guild Treasury		- Guild Shops			- 3 shops, one for weapons, one for 			armour and one for misc objects: 			ointment/oils/stones/waxes/seals.  These 			items are in question and would like to 			know what you think about them staying in 			the game.- I would like to impliment a NOPK all peace roomed guild town, you've already seen the jest of it.  In this town there would be:		- coaches to many areas around PD at a discounted 		price for guilds.		- boats that work like coaches that will take you 		to areas at a price.			- these would be good b/c it gives some 			sort of an incentive and yet it's still 			fair..it's not a portal that takes you 			there instantly and you still do have to 			pay just not as much.		- (debatable) A pray room that can only be used 		so many time per reboot, i'm thinking 5 at most 		for a 30 hour period.		- A universal scry room that EVERYONE in a guild 		can use.			- Member/leader boards and the Guild treasury as 		a whole.		- Class halls/angel/demon/dragon halls for upping 		things	- This guild town will NOT be free of charge.  Every guild will have the option to partake in the guild town.  If they do not want to pay to use it, they do not have to, they just wont get any of it's perks.  If they want to be apart of it then they will either pay me so much upfront, or they can have their guild dues payment upped..not sure on which would be better. - Guild dues will ALWAYS be apart of PD, it will be a way to keep guilds and guild leaders active and united by voting new leaders if the leader is MIA.  If the guild owner is on vacation or any other valid reasons, then they must tell me and if it is over a month then they will be replaced, if it's is less than if it's acceptable of a reason they can just pay their dues when they get back.- as far as if a guild is inactive and no members are there no dues are paid, that guild will be put in a holding state...if someone can come to me and provide a good case with buying the guild and having it active with members, i would consider appointing them the guild.Let me know what you think of these ideas so i can get started!  Thank Whit!  i mailed you the areas i know of right now that i need for write access."
