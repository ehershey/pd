__Letter "//i can try better if you wantFor once a tale told so bold,Of the blood red princess dressed in gold.At the full moon's rising, at the full moon's night,The fires of hell showed her true for of fright.Her one true love, a man of great respect,Was torn inside for his love's regret.One night in spring, unto her did heTake her life with a knife, and then decree\"May this grove forever be full of roses scorned,\"For my heart is now broken, and my soul battle-worn.\"Now at this moment, did the Fairy Queen seeA sore-hearted man, and in her heart felt pity.Into a fearies' mist did the Queen lead him,So that forever may his soul rest without thought of sin.And so the King of Faeries commanded the dales,To cry dew-drop tears every misty night,In memory of the sad and unforetunate taleOf the Princess and her Knight."
