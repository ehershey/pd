__Letter "So far as I'm concerned, I'm done with the xp curve idea. It is no longer a flat cut, but bases the cut on a comparison of the mob's level to your's. The cuts start on mobs roughly 75-80% of your level, but they're pretty minor at that point. They are ~80% at the point that the old cuts started happening, and those were a flat 66%, so it's better at that point for players, though above that they're slightly worse since there is a cut vs. full xp under the old system, and under that the cuts eventually hit 50%, then no xp at all below the 50% (which happens on a mob at either 40% or 50% of your level, I'd have to look at the code to remember for sure).Anyway, I like it, on paper anyway, and haven't had any major complaints about it (only had two players whine that it forces them to be bitches by not getting items for lower leveled players, or forces to play a certain way, the first I disagree with entirely, and the second, well, the xp they would have got from those low level mobs would have been pathetic had I let the cuts go all the way done, so it's a moot point, IMO).If any of you want a C++ file you can compile, or an executable that I compiled, let me know, I'll mail one or the other to you, so you can see the effects on xp up to level 110."
