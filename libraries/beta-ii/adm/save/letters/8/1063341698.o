__Letter "Have you heard of everyone.net? Would you be willing to forward all the email for the primaldarkness.com domain to their servers? I am thinking of emailing them for the free account, wich will allow us to have online email through them with the domain name. I would really like to offer email to players so I figured this would be the easiest way to do it.Stormy"
