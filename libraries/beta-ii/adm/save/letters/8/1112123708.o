__Letter "I know what your problem is. When you're going through the loop to see who is on and who is not, if they're not on you add their name to one variable, and query_last_on() to another. The problem is, you're calling that query_last_on() from a string, not an object, so it fails. The only way to find out when they were last on is to have a last_on variable and restore_object their filename. You'll have to look at /daemon/daemon/finger_d.c to help ya."
