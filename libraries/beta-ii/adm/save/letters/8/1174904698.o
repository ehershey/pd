__Letter "Alright Nul-man. I know that charge is a really good fighter move, the best fighter move pretty much, and I know there have been  SEVERAL complaints on it and complaints on it being slow for races other than centaur, and now including raknid. But seriously...charge IS indeed one of the best moves in a fighter's arsenal, and the slow 3 round charge isn't cutting it. The way I, and probably others look at it, is fighters are pretty much useless without charge. it's not that the other moves aren't good, but charge is that good initiate that has a pretty heavy hit, and 2-legged people can't use it unless we wanna wait forever, and that's just slow...all i'm saying, is could you make a move for the 2-legged guys? Like footcharge which allows us to charge on foot? Or maybe making charge the same rounds for everyone? Please think on this.Thank you,Alexander"
