__Letter "I know that I've given you reasons to hate me in the past, and I know that you have reason to hate me.  I know that everyone has reason to hate me, however, not everyone does.  I've changed quite a bit, and a lot of people who used to hate me like me now.  I've been around since PD began, I know a lot about PD and what it's about, I can code, and I like to PK.  I've been in Forsaken before on various characters, and I believe it is the right guild for me.  I have already been getting along well with Dubbya and Endbringer, and I believe I can get along well with you too, if you give me the chance."
