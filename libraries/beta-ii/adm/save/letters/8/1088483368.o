__Letter "Okay this will be very choppy, so I hope you know your idea quite well.The event will consist of dark elves invading the lands, killing off dragons and using the corpses for new weapons and such....Once you find the new area (need torch) and enter, there will be orbs scattered about, you will need to find all 9 of them in order for a hidden area to be shown to you, once inside, there will be 9 corresponding dragon statues find them and place the orbs and a portal will open.  *NOTE* Blue dragon will be diffrent from this point, It will be later on in the mailYou enter the portal and come to the place where instead of the mother missing, one egg will be hatched and the baby missing, all you know that there is a dragon loose, and the mother doesn't seem to care,  Anyways I have a human green dragon that I need coded up (got the description on him but nothing else) and he will show up on the island later.  Anyway, you need to pick up the stuff you mentioned, the knife, vial, oil, diamonds and look for the pedestal, figure out the pedestal symbol and you get magically teleported to the island city you mentioned.  Find all the scales, get the statue and head up to the sacrificial site....wait for the moon etc like you mentioned...but one little twistat the site there will be some sort of stone pedestal of sort, that will require the yellow, blue, cyan, green, magenta and orange scales to light a fire then you only have the red, black and white scale to be placed into the clay statue.  Do the sacrificial rite of passage...and on your way to the riddlesGreen will need the presence of the boy, give the green scale to the boy, kill yourself in front of him, he will somehow save your life and turn you into a dragonBlue will require all nine orbs placed in a special order to open a diffrent portal and a diffrent quest all together*NOTE* Once you pass through any given area....you can not come backIf we do it this way....I don't see having the quest open to anyone who finds it....the orbs/scales/items will only be one per reboot...and if there are two people trying to do the quest, they will not be able to finish the quest because they will not have all the items.  But I'm all for just having one person per reboot being allowed into the areaLet me know what you think...it still needs work, but I did promise I would have something in your mailbox before you came back :)Hep"
