__Letter "Yes thats correct. If your sitting and in combat wimpy doesn't kick in.It makes for a very very nasty bug against monsters with flying drop kick and a bad connection. I probably lose my connection once every 10 minutes or so due to my connection. with 2840 life there is no way a monster without special abilities could kill me without this bug. I lost close to 300 million exp to this and all my gear including several one of kind items and multiple diamonds.Please is it possible to have what I lost to the bug restored?Thanks,-- Vyce"
