__Letter "Daos has left because of 2 reasons, players and Wraith.  Theres several other things.  I will keep a log of all the shit that has happened tonight. Azire thinks we should all get together and talk about what should be done about Wraith.  The <admin> line is no longer protected.  He can just set his class or sub to admin and get the same line.  Perhaps on msn, away from mud distractions.Whit"
