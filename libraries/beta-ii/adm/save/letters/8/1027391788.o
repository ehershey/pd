__Letter "Just so you know, what Dagmar and I did wasn't personal.  If you want, I have a few friends that can help you get back some of your equipment.  I hope you don't think it was personal, either.  I realize you want to kill me and I won't be mad at you when you do.But just so you know, Dagmar and I will never try and go after you again."
