__Letter "i noticed the eternal rose back in my inventory .... was that your doing, or just a game glitch? ... if it was your doing.. *sigh* i miss you - and thanks for the gesture ... if it was a glitch - i miss you anyway ... ^_- I'm going up to the cities tomorrow (saturday) early in the day - and staying til Sunday ... but i'll be back after that. I doubt i'll be online much, though - things are getting REALLY busy around here what with moving coming up and me having .. oh ... roughly 10 days to finish my murals. @_@ .. heto heto!! (overwhelmed) anyway .. i'm thinkin' of you. ~Azzy/Jenna~"
