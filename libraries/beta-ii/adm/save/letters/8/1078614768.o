__Letter "Ok, would like the nunchaku to be able to trip the enemy, and would be sweet if the helmet could restore sps on a regular basisAlso if it's possible, a cloak that only raknids can wear that is somewhat like mage robes.. since we cant wear themmaybe like some kind of web theme to it <worn around body> \"A tightly wrapped cloak of webs\" or somethingif i assume correctly we must pay for these with guild cash right?another cool thing for the kabuto would be if it put you into a trance and while in the trance u could scry people, or if it has a built in whistle inside that either paralyzes the enemy or lowers it's stats"
