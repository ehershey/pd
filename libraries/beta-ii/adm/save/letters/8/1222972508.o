__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Uzamaki to Uzamaki Thu Oct  2 11:48:07 2008:-----I would like a room which wouldnt be a locker room, per se. Itwould be this communal area to leave things for each other toenhance the sense of community and promote more visiting tothe guild. Each day, you could log on like Christmas and say'ooo, what did folks leave for me to play with?' Of course, theitems would need to stay over reboot and not reset._______________________________________________________________Room Description:This is the repository of the Darksouls. Various weapons, itemsand armour used for causing the misery of all is strewn aroundfor the common bad. Skeletons in various corners of the roomclutch weapons, wear helmets and appear ready for combat. Hookshang from the ceiling upon which items are hung."
