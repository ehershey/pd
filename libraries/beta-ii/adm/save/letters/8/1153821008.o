__Letter "Hey Stormy, Well today Reso and I went into the arena to try out my BS since i raised dex and int a few.  I killed Reso and it started to spam that Reso died in the arena, and I was still stuck in there.  Neither he nor I could quit out then Arma tried to kill me in there so it would end and it started to spam that i was killed in the arena.  Then my hp went down to -300 or so and the I think Daos did a reboot cause of the spam.  When i signed in again under Tai i still had -300 hp and i instantly died in the square,  I lost 2 lvls skills dex int and some saved up xp.  I was wondering if i could be reimbursed for this loss.  Pls email me back when you get the chance. ThnxTai the novice mudder"
