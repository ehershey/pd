__Letter "%^RED%^f%^RESET%^er%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^rel%^RED%^f%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^n%^BOLD%^%^RED%^g %^BLACK%^ri%^RED%^n%^BLACK%^g%^RESET%^Fangs of a ferrel have been fused together to form this handsomeivory-like ring with flecks of blood and gingivitis. While it maynot look that special, you sense it is far more than meets the eye.___________________________________________________________________This ring would act similar to a ruby red belt. It would charge upduring battle and then allow its owner to maintain their current spvia a command depending on how much the ring has charged. This way,for a brief period the user can unload a couple highly priced attacksfor minimal pain. If that isn't possible, the ring could work likea cleric's vigor reducing costs greatly.Anubis of the Dead should sell this sweet thing for 16666 gold.(Also, if possible, it'd be great if dragons could use all of theitems I have pitched. Thanks either way!)"
