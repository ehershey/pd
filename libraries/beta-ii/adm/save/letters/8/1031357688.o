__Letter "Ok, first i'm sorry about my wording in yesterdays post ect, i had a shitty day, hit my finger with a sledge hammer towards the end of it.. came home put ice on my finger, then xp'd with aldur, got 110M xp lvl'd to 50, maxed melee and attack, tested massacre on seth, and it only did like 495 over 2 rounds, and gore did 270 a round, and gore is worse then slash so slash would end up doing a lot more once i max blade and double wielding. All i was saying was massacre like a lot of moves needs to be looked into.i really would rather not cide, since demons are 'best' off as a fighter, and i'll wait it out for that to be so."
