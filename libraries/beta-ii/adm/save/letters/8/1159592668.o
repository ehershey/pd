__Letter "i put your son on ignore a couple days ago b/c he was being rude and all, and i have been told that tonight he has just ungodfully rude, i cannot see what he's saying but if you check the newbie logs, i hear it's quite mean.  I do not wish to take him off of ignore b/c i do not wish to fight..that's why he was ignored in the first place.  I do, however, find it very childish and rude that he continues when he should just stop.  Thank you."
