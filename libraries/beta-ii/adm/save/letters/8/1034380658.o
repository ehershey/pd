__Letter "Pyro the dragonIt all started with the dragon with the color red,Which was made fun of by all, including archangels with bard of lead.Now Pyro was no ordinary dragon, just friends he wanted to make,But all hated and despised him for no reason, his trust they did break.now thou hast not the knowledge of dragons to comprehend,But these fools did hurt his trust more than normally one could mend.And on and on for many years did this go on,Until one day from the pits of hell an evil in his heart did spawn!in the day that all of thine and ours scrolls dost define,he swore vengance would be his, and suffering be thine!From the black clouds tore the red streak of hate and rage,And naught could be done, though try did a puny mage.All was doomed, and naught to be spared,Just as naught had liked him, or even really cared.But from the mountain of guilds and items to be sold,Took off a dragon in color of black, and with a heart full of gold.She took off like lightning, and his evil destruction she did put to end,With kind words, and even advice to lend!The people all over, they learned not to be mean,To the now happy dragon that had sent off so much steam.Suddenly he was gone, for quite a long while,And a new, kind boy, appeared in the villages with a happy little smile.What was his name? Thou shalt never find out,Lest thee destroy all that is good, thine evil, vile lout.note: i ment to use the old archaic form of language, that is.. onpourpose.this story was inpsired to my by... guess :)"
