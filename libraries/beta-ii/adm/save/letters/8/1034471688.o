__Letter "Well, Ryan got out of work early today, and Ephraim hasnt started yet, so it seems that we'll be playing DnD again today...  I'll leave MSN on \"busy\", but if you send me a message I'll hop right over to talk to you for a few before you have to leave.  *hugs you tightly and kisses you gently on the cheek*  I'll be thinking of you.                                  -Paul"
