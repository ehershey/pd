__Letter "Hey.I was bored so I figured I talk to your absent self... but you'd still be able to read it later. Hope you're having fun with your x best friend. Sorry you waited all day for me, and when I finaly could get on, you had to jet. My bad. Least I got a chance to say hi.I may be on later tomorrow... don't wait on me, but if I see you that'll be sweet. Do anything else cool today? What'd you do with your friend? Just catch back up or what? Doh, ok, I gotta end this random letter, got some stuff to chat about with some new fighters on the fighter line. Hey, if you get that sword done, I'm out of AoD. Wisp and Gob are kinda taking over it and doing all kinds of wierd stuff... and it's just not the same anymore. I need something different. Later M'lady!When you give a mouse a Cookie, he'll want a glass of milk."
