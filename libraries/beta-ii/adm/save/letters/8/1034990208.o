__Letter "Well, I'm keeping u pretty busy, lol. But, this time I want a house :). It'll be a lockable one, and I think you'll need the description for it. This is the one for the first room I want, rightn now.It's the one you enter at.You have entered the house of Mochaprincess. This is the living room, all around you, you see leather. In the corner is huge t.v screen, right in front of it is a enormous leather couch, and beside that are two big leather recliners. The carpet is pure Siberian tiger fur, better be careful not to get anything on that, she's liable to kill you! The walls are painted a shade of white, which goes very well with the black leather.I don't know how you charge for the other rooms, so mail me back with that and I'll give ya everything else.Mocha."
