__Letter "First of all. Can you copy /wizards/amarael/illuminati/ from PD to the builders port? The files here are more up to date and less buggy. There are also a whole bunch of changes there.All the additions and so on have been included in the the file \"notes\" in the /illuminati dir I believe. That should have everything in it."
