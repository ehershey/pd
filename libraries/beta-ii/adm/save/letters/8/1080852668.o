__Letter "So, maybe it was just a mistake. But i don't believe that bit about his triggers killed me. I was in the room already, he walked in about halfway through my fight, or near the end, adn my cw hit him. Then after that he followed me out of wimpy I'm pretty sure and killed me. Anyway, I'm not ready to let this rest just yet. I still don't quite believe it was a total accident, and I want to find out more info first."
