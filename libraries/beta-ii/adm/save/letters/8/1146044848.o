__Letter "I did the whole quest and in the end the girl does not give me time to \"ascend\" and become an archangel, if i try to ascend when the girl is talking or before it says \"You should wait for the girl to finish talking\", but after the girl is done talking it says \"You have already completed the quest...etc etc and just transports me to Tirun[]. I think I will become Archangel if the girl lets me \"ascend\", maybe im wrong but i think it is a bug.Yours truly,Agnidev."
