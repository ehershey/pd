__Letter "Greg9678: oi, ya know, i used to think that you, azzy, and everyone in the DW guild were really nice, polite, and tried their hardest at everything, and you know what else? i thought they were my friends. there are not many people that i call my friend, and i dont take that lighty, but you have all betrayed my trust, more than once, and then proved yourself not as nice as i once thought you were. and the members, whenever you say anything, anything at all, they all must go out of their way to report it. well, phooey on that, im glad you kicked me, because if i would have been there when all of you guys acted like this, the first thing i would have typed would be \"remort\" my one regret is that i didnt get to do that, leave. goodnight. i hope you dont treat your baby like this, oi, im going to bed. and, knowing you, you will probrably tell every single person you know.Greg9678: just as would have been done if i told the snitch A.K.A azire, well, have a good day, knowing you betrayed a childs trustGreg9678 signed off at 7:49:13 PM. "
