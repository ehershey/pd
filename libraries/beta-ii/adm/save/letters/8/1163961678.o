__Letter "I have tested the s-fun out extensively. It works like a charm.You will find a like to test the inputs in the following files;cp <item_1> <item_2>    CHecks item_1 for an ID from something                        in the room with the user.ed <object>             Checks the objects in contact with the                        editor for ID's and puts them in editmore <object>           Checks for ID's of the objects the                        person is in contact with for IDsIn all 3 cases, the insertion still uses the present securityscreens to weed out files a person shouldn't be seeing :PI still want to find a way to prevent a builder from callingthis s-fun. Unless of course you guys fell it's no big dealif they know WHERE the file is if they can't ACCESS it.Ironman"
