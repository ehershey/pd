Smite is a real good friend just looking out for me, so I'd appreciate it if you took this into consideration. You can watch me and watch me, Stormy, I don't script or exploit anything. Genocide backstabbed me, I survived and mocked him and he got all anal. From what I hear he exploits all sorts of stuff, Smite said he's suprised he hasn't been banned yet. But I'm not going to stoop to his level and make stuff up and I don't really want to cause drama. I just want to save my own ass before it gets burned. Thanks Stormy.Smokey"
