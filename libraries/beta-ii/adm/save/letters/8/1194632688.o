__Letter "Hi, I was thinking before I went to sleep that the reason he took me intothe arena and \"let me kill him\" is that he wanted to see how high my stats were from watching me.  And yes, you are probably right about joining the guild.  So, maybe I should quickly join your one?  Or should I just say thanks, and that I'vealready had an invitation somewhere else?Have a good nap, hope to talk to you soon."
