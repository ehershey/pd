__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Ironman to Daos Sun May  4 15:16:51 2008:-----I had a new idea come to me fellas.I'm thinking of developing a new storage system for guilds. Thesystem would also work as a storefront for the guild. Here arethe hi-lights i have in mind so far;   1) Members can put anything they wish into the storage system.   2) There will be two storefronts ;       a) Public ---           1) This storefront is what the general population would              be charged for the given item. The $ from the sale              would go directly to the guild's treasury.           2) I could easily set it up so the guild masters can give              the person who put the item in the store would gain a              % of the sale if you desire it.           3) I would set it so a minimal price for items is settable by              the staff. This would prevent a person from abusing the no              AL rules. It would make no sense to deposit a diamond if you              have to spend 2 million gold just to get it back out >:)        b) Guild-only -----            1) This storefront is for objects that they guild wants open               to it's membership only. Either that or at a different price               than what would be charged to the public.            2) Just like the public storefront, the staff would be able to               setup miminimal prices for items.     3) Once an item has been placed into the storage system, it is placed        up for sale at the last known pricing set. In the event that no price        has been set, the item will be LOCKED into the storage system until a        price HAS been set. If a default minimal price is set for the item by        the staff, it will be placed at that price. This is ment to prevent        a person from getting around the AL rules.=============================================================================Basically it works like this....   1) player gets item.   2) player deposits item into its guild storage system.   3) the object is then placed for sale in the guild store.      It would be priced at the staff's mimial setting if no price is      given. If not price is set, the object is unremovable until a price      is set.    4) If the guild master wishes for the item(s) to be sellable to the       public, then the item is also listed in the public storefront at       the public selling price.    5) if you wish the player to have a % of the sale, i can code that in.    6) if you wish for there to be a \"sales tax\" on the transaction, i can       code that in as well.============================================================================I would be making the object unremovable without a selling price so peoplecan NOT abuse the system to circumvent the AL rules. Like putting a goodweapon in the store and then taking it out later. They would have to BUYthe item back.It would make it pointless to try it when you would need to spend 50,000 goldjust to get your sword back :)=========================================================================Please get back to me on this new idea. I need a response so i can startto flesh out the new system. I'm going to have a central object controllingit so that there is one mapping that stores all the staff's pricing.The room that inherits that room would also carry a mapping to store theguild masters prices.===========================================================================Respond asap. I intend on getting to work on this by next weekend.I need feedback on anything that you would like to have changed inthis new idea im planning.Ironman"
