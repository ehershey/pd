__Letter "I have made some chages to the roster folks.Wisp and Lyssandra have not been around with us in awhile. As a result, i have placed them as Dragon Warriors. This is not a punishment of any sort and is not to be considered a lower rank.I consider us all equals here. They only difference in the ranks is the jobs that the people will be performing for us and not so much as a social standing.Dragon Masters --- Diplomatic relations both with other guilds                   and the immortals.Dragoons ------- Research and developement                This rank will design our future equipment                and any additions to our guild we wish to put                in place.Dragon Knights ---- Mapping and exploration                   (oviously i don't mean for QI info)                   This rank is to gain general directions to and from areas                   It will benifit all of us if we have to defend one of                   our ranks from an attack if we can get to them quickly.Dragon warriors --- Retires and Initiates                   This rank isn't expected to do much of anything                   cept keep us company :)If you wish for Cortoth or myself to change your rank via this model just tell usironman"
