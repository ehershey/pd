__Letter "Sorry I wasnt a little more active in the conversation earlier today...  I've just been a bit out of it lately.  Just wanted to mail you and let you know that I love you and look forward to talking to you again.  Or even just listening to you talk, as the case may be.  *winks*  *kisses you softly*  goodnight, Jenna.                                -Your Paul"
