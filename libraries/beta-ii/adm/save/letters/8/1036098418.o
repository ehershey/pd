__Letter "Yo, folks.It's getting to be about that time where I need to start to compile for our first newspaper.So far.  Sugarcandy has written a responce to a question by Wraith.  I would like you to get me the question, as well.  We will keep his name annoyomous.Mochaprincess has written in engaging article about PK and Vampira has provided an opinion on the same subject.  Which is nice... gives balanceAutema has written something... fitting for the first paper.I still need things from Daos, Levi, Stormy (Your ads), Nightshade, and Furion. But Furion is not required as he's freelancing it.Mail them to me soon, please.  As I still need to figure out how to compile this mess.-Love and cowsHermes"
