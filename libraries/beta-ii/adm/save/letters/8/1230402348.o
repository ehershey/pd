__Letter "Dearest Empyrean,How have you been doing lately? I sailed into the dark ocean again but could not find the small island I found before. I regret not paying attention to where I was going when I was there last time but it is just too late now... I may never be able to find the island again. I hope we will be able to venture out into the ocean together someday.Love, Arial =)"
