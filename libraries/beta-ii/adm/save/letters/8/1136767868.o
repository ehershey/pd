__Letter "Hey, sorry to bother ya...but the reason I am mudmailing you is b/c dabby said you were the one to talk to when I sked him if anything was coming on my areas I made.  The reason I am asking, is b/c they have been done for like 3 months now.  I wanted to know what you have done on it and if there is anything I have to do to change anything?  I know that some things need redone or changed a bit, but I have no idea what they are or what specific things need reworked.  I really worked hard on these areas and want to help the best i can by getting them in as soon as possible.  Thank you hun, and please let me know the status thus far and what I can do to change things and help move things faster"
