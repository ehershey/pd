__Letter "I really hate to bother you but i talked to daos and he said to mail an admin about this. Ok on the demon quest you go through a maze and enter a portal after that you read a tomb and it says embrace the light to leave and save your soul or forsake the light to go on i decided that i didn't want to go demon and tried to embrace the light and it gave me this message *call_other() couldn't find objectno immortal was unidle at the time so i went on with the quest hoping i could turn back later but when i went in i went to a wrong direction and got raped by demons i know its my fault for not knowing but i wanted to go back and i couldn't because of a bug... daos fixed the bug now i lost a few stats my armour but thats not so hard to get back but i was hoping you could replace the 3 levels i lost to get back to 50 because no ones in my range and the xp cuts make it so i can't level back up because im not strong enough to xp in forbidden forest alone... thanks for your time again sorry for bugging ya."
