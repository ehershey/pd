__Letter "hey, I'm heading to bed so i thought i would send you this really quick.  /wizards/amun/sky is the area that's done, and it's just the main town area, the 4 gats are to come, as well as a break in the clounds.  if there is anything you wish for me to add, take out, or change let me know and I will.As far as where this is going, I was thinking of something in lodos, the bell that normally is there for the angel quest, I was thinking maybe having a command there that will take you to the sky temple...idk, it's just an idea, what do you think about how it should go in?  stormy was oging to make up sky ships, but that never happened...so idk. anyway, I will be on more tomorrow b/c i don't have work or school...i'm just hella tired and my net is acting up..but the area is done and needs reviewed..Thanks Nul-Amun"
