__Letter "I've made a list of some races and stat costs to compare to the new costs I worked out for vampire, I wanted your input/suggestions/demands whatever for how much their stats actually cost.humanStrength:       *****                   Dexterity:      *****                   Constitution:   *****                   Charisma:       ******                  Intelligence:   *****                   Wisdom:         ****** This is an example of a weak non-quest race.  A human.It has balance but a poor total of 32.__________________________________________________________demonStrength:       ********               Dexterity:      ********               Constitution:   *******                Charisma:       **                     Intelligence:   ******                 Wisdom:         ***  Here is an example quest race, demon.  It is muchsuperior to the human, has special abilities and therift command which can save from a lot of death.  Avery well done quest race.__________________________________________________________vampireStrength:       *******               Dexterity:      *******                Constitution:   **************              Charisma:       *******                Intelligence:   *****                Wisdom:         *****This is how I think vampires should be.  Strong, fast and charismatic with the intelligence of a human andslightly lower wisdom.  They have the highest stat ingame of \"consitution\" because I felt that vampires wereeasily the healthiest race under immortals/gods.  Theircon doesn't mean size, it's all the health.  Their total is 45, which might seem high but it's the same as bastet.  They deserve a 45 because the arrangementof the stats is fair and the quest is very difficultregardless of your level.  _________________________________________________________ bastetStrength:       ********               Dexterity:      ***********             Constitution:   *****                  Charisma:       ************            Intelligence:   *****                  Wisdom:         ****    I just thought I'd include bastet, another quest racewith a 45 cost total.  I'm assuming they also have ahard quest.  I'm also thinking that no race shouldever exceed 45.    Well thanks for taking a peek.  Keep in mind for vampires, they have their own class \"deathless\" so they don't really use their str/dex whatever for slashing, or their int/wis for casting spells.  "
