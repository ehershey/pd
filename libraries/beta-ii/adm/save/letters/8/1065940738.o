__Letter "My character is still marked as being married to eilistraee, but the character doesn't exist. It gets a bit annoying because I still have the ring and I can't get rid of it. It also means I can't marry other chars, if I wanted.I've tried divorce but it won't work, even if eilistraee is remade, it checks to see if she is married and she isn't. Quite annoying.Are you able to call up my character and remove the 'married to:' marker?"
