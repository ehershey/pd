__Letter "Ok..i had to write this letter to get things off my chest.I had asked you earlier on the mud if you had dinner if not i would have cancelled the moviething right there, but you didnt respond.Then later you tell me you do, and we couldnt make the 2:00 show anyways, so whats the point of going?Other than that i hate always to be the one to ask you what you want to doyou make no initative to call me either.So im at my wits end already, and cant handle this ...so simple answeri wont.All i want are whatever things are left at your house.,"
