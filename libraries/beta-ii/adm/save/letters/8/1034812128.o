__Letter "*nod*  I would also agree.  If whit gets stuff all cleared up, I wouldnt object to him doing the admin thing.  Daos is a good guy and means well, but I just dont trust him with that position.  He's on a lot, but he's restricted so much now because of things he's done in the past, and I still think he'd be likely to do that sort of thing again."
