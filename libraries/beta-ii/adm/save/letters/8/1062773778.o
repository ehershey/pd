__Letter "I just had a not so nice conversation with Wraith, who was being slightly abusive about Prator, but didn't seem to know that was me, or something. Haha. That's not the point though. He said that characters that are cided have no backups, unless you specifically saved my character. So... did you make a save of my character, or would it have automatically been saved when cided?If it is saved, then you will restore? Once you get the backups?If it is not on the backups/not saved, can it be restored as close as possible just by using the admin 'call' command? I promise I'm not going to try and cheat and get stuff I didn't have. I saved all my stats and skills right before I died, and know what they should probably be. I had no eq either. I just really want to play the character.Just a little worried about it. Cided due to personal reasons that are no longer in effect (totally reversed, in fact).-Aziraphale- \"Hope springs eternal\""
