__Letter "Hey, can you make it so that we can do the quest more than once per reboot. Certain people are doing the quest over and over just so that others can't be dragons. I don't see how it could be fair when you bust your butt to figure out a quest and someone who knows it can just keep doing it so that noone else can have dragons."
