__Letter "I have boosted ALgren on builders today. He claimed to me thathe had Daos' permission to be on builders and knows Whit IRL.I'm willing to give him a shot .....but...... if either of theabove claims are false, then he WILL be banned. I dont like a liar.I hope you don't mind my boosting him. I would have perfered ifhe DID have Daos' or one of your permission to have had a mud-mailso i coulda boosted him and started to teach him tho folksIronman.Like i said if either of his claims about Daos or Whit are false,Please remove this builder or mail me and i will."
