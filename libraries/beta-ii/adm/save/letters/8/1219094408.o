__Letter "Hi,I know you meant well.  It just across to me that I should try to help them out, even though it was killing me to do so.  I'm sorry I wasn't on, I had an anxiety attack, because I thought I wasgoing to have to face them on here and talk to them, when I clearly didn't think I should.  Not because I wanted to be mean, because I'm not that wayat all.  I was going to leave it for awhile and when I was ready to forgive them,then maybe I could deal with it.I know you meant well, but I guess I felt I was being lectured about turning theother cheek and I'm not ready yet to do that.I saw Paul today and I told him and he told me that right now... I focuson my needs and whatever problems they have, they should help themselves.Maybe when I can sometime down the road, I will.  "
