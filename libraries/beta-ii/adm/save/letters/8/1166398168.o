__Letter "Ok...So here's my little problem that I'v run into, and I'm hoping very much that something can be done to help...Well i went through the whole angel quest, but I guess i forgot to do something as part of it...Cause i finished it, and im not an angel...And then I attempted to do it over again, and it just tells me that I'v already done it.  So i can't.Is there anything that I can do, so that I can still do it over and become an archangel?Thanks ahead for any help in this, and I'll ttyl hopefully.-Patriarch- Pauley Capone."
