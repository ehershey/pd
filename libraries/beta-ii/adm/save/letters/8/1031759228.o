__Letter "Glad you're back, hope ya had fun. Pity you couldn't swing by and visit me in Oklahoma =P  But it's arright..Anywho, the guild pretty much ran itself. Added a couple new members, I see Sreath was added (I don't really like him, but I won't be a prick to him or anything.) Not a whole hell of a lot happened. The treasury grew bigger, that's about it. That and I got bigger.. =P"
