__Letter "I tried to grab yer hubby or Whit but neither one has responded :(I have coded a system that will allow ALL objects to hold informationfor the following senses and commands;    _smell.c        Scents and aromas (like perhaps perfumes and such)    _taste.c        This would hold things like flavors and spices.    _feel.c         Textures and other feelings for objects.    _listen.c       Sounds that can be coded onto the objects.    _examine.c      This is ment for details on objects. I'm thinking                    like for emblems and symbols on a sword and the like.    _look.c         Basically the same as the current command.    _read.c         I have gutted the old cmd_read from the Object.c and                    coded this command to replace and upgrade the system                    to allow more information to be accessed by the read                    command.    _search.c       Same as read.All of the above commands read the information off of mappings i codedinto my iron_senses.c file. They will execute a function if one is storedin the mapping as well :) Please come check over my newest experiment.I want to know if this is something you and Stormbringer would like toinclude into Primal Darkness. I want a review from either you, stormbringeror Whit on this system. This way i can clean up anything you would wantchanged or modified. Providing of course that you would want the system.I feel it would add another whole dimention to the realm if builders couldadd this level of detail to their creations :)Ironman"
