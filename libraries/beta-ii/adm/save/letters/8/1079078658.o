__Letter "I forgot to say that I really respected you staying around for combat, and even going for the kill. All the forsaken people run away as soon as they see me (or Aldur). Even a few weeks ago Lac only went after me as a double team with lucifer. Eios did the same to Blits, who gets stuck in rage.Anyway, might not count for much but thought I should say."
