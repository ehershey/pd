__Letter " \"Hawaii is a unique state. It is a small state. It is a state that is  by itself. It is different from the other 49  states. Well, all states aredifferent, but it's got a particularly unique situation.\" --- Dan Quayle, VP [they made him swim home after that one]   \"Your food stamps will be stopped effective March 1992 because we received  notice that you passed away. May God bless you. You may reapply if there is achange in your circumstances.\" --- Department of Social Services, Greenville, South Carolina [right after youcall the New York Times]   \"We apologize for the error in last week's paper in which we stated  that Mr.Arnold Dogbody was a defective in the police force. We meant, of course, thatMr. Dogbody is a detective in the police farce.\" --- Correction Notice in the Ely Standard, a British newspaper   \"If somebody has a bad heart, they can plug this jack in at night as they goto bed and it will monitor their heart throughout the night. And the nextmorning, when they wake up dead, there'll be a record.\" --- Mark S. Fowler, FCC Chairman [and they'll cut off your food  stamps] "
