__Letter "azuma tells you: I love you because you are always there for me reguardless ifyou can talk to me or not, I mean I can feel your presense kinda (weird, Iknow), I love you because of how you make my heart flutter every time I talk toyou, I love you because you have such an awesome personality, you're funny,romantic, caring, and sincre.(not to mention I hear you don't look bad *winks*)I love you because if I'm mad I can always turn to you to calm me down and makeme happy again. I love you because you show me true happiness even though youare so far away. I love the way you act and how you can sometimes get a littleattitude (yes, I think it's cute when your mad/pissy) I love how you can takecare of your little sister whenever she wants or needs something, it shows alot (like you'll be a good mom :) ) I love how you always find the time for me,reguardless if you have something to work on or if you're grounded. Andfinally, I love you because you are you."
