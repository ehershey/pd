__Letter "I think I know a few of the circumstances reguarding my removal as part of your staff, i.e. Daos and nightshade leaving, but I would like to hear your end of it if I may ask that.I am sorry about nightshade, and slysar leaving, slysar was an accident and I think nightshade just got tired of me. Daos I really didnt believe was up to handling the players and their questions, but I am sorry that he has left the game. All of them were good people that appearantly I had run off by my actions and I am truly sorry for that.I would also like to apologize to you, personally, for failing in my duties to the game and to you as an employer. There are many things I could have done to prevent Daos and slysar from leaving your employ, and I regret for not trying everything in my power with daos. I did talk to slysar for an hour, convinced him to stay on a little bit longer, little did I know his intentions were to remove all his files, I thought that I had convinced him to stay on with builders and code for us.There is one thing that I would like to request from you: That you restore this character from the backup file that I had you make, and either force him to remort, or set him to lvl 1 like you have for most of the other immortals that have left you. I hope I have served you good enough in my past year of employ to merit that one request.It was fun working with you and the other immortals on the game port and builders, and I enjoyed being on the game port as an immortal for a little while. I hope to code for you in the future when I have more time on my hands and a little more imagination in my head.Thanks for being a good friend, Admin, and boss stormie.                       -=Wraith=-"
