__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Nightshade to Stormbringer Sun Jul 28 21:49:16 2002:-----Stormy...  I've lately found myself not wanting to code at all.  In fact, I cant even sleep because of it.  It's 3:30AM and I've got a job interview at 9 :P  Anyway...  I just had to tell ya a few things.  Kinda like before, when phase 2 was just getting off the ground, I've become pessimistic about the future of PD.  It seems like once again you and I are the only ones who care enough to put the effort into this game.  (hence you're the only one I'm bothering to email).  I think it's amazing that you're still goin with all the spells and stuff.  I would have been overwhelmed long ago.  I guess I'm a bit discouraged because the bug log doesnt go away.  It's always there.  And I'm the one that has to take care of all of it.  Even the parts where it's in so deep, I havent the slightest idea how to fix it (deaths not registering, for instance).  What little room PD seems to have for expansion seems to be left to unbalanced areas that only help to throw off item balance even more.  It's all so way off, it's near impossible to go through every item to keep balance.  I tried.  I couldnt hardly scrape the surface of merk.  It seems like that's always going to be embedded in this game, and it wont help the future growth.  I feel like I should move on to something where the base I'm working off of isnt full of bugs to begin with (NM mudlib) and where I can make sure things are set up from the start so that the final result will be a success.  Umm..  that about sums it up.  I'm taking a break for now.  I'll be available if you guys need help with anything specific, but I'm going to start making plans of my own.  You can forward this to whoever you want to hear it.  Anyway.  I'll be around.                              -Paul LeBlond (Nightshade)                               paul.leblond@student.oc.edu                               rich_beggar@hotmail.comStormy"
