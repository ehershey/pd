__Letter "Hiro tells you: first he was just annoying me, then he was talkin about me,then my friend died and he thought i wanted to loot his corpse cause iaccidently auto-saced his mobs as soon as i enter'd  the room and then wouldntshut up about it on the newbie line, then he started saying how much mycharecter sucked, and just now he walked in while i was killing a mob and hekilled it on purpose"
