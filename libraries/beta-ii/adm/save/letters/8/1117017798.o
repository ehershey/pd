__Letter "you wouldnt believe what i did. my winrar didnt realize it was extracting my xandros cds from the .iso (didnt realize they were iso) files so i was like why the fuck is this simple to install debian distribution god damn near impossible. i fuckin had to find floppies. 1 out of 3 i had didnt have bad sectors. so i made a boot1440 file after wiating for it to format..then switch rooms switch comps..come back..rawrite -d A: -f path boot2880.img -n whatever..fawkin error. floppy controller. it aint the disk. its the fuckin img file. so..i find the smallest debian installer i can rc3. kinda cool. it has 3 floppies required so i had to format the same floppy 3 times..only to get a red screen sayin my linux disk aint really a linux disk (duh i knew that)..so here i am wondering how the easiest linux out there is commercial..and impossible to install. fuckin dumbass..i just noticed the cd files were .iso's im diggin around tryin to find linux utils i can use on these cds..heh..was hilarious..i installed this shit on a laptop before in like 30 seconds..maybe its cuz its 4am and i been up for a few days. heh, later. had to share :P"
