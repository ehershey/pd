__Letter "Your way works fine, and is probably how most people would do it.I, being crazy about efuns, would do it more like this:string *output;object *who;who = filter(users(), (: in_edit($1) :) );output = map(who, (: $1->query_cap_name()+\" \"+in_edit($1) :) );if (sizeof(output))  message(\"info\", implode(output, \"\\n\"), tp);else  message(\"info\", \"No one is currently editing.\", tp);return 1;Might be slightly faster, but maybe not.Oh, your int cmd_code() func should take a string argument, even if you don't use it...aside from that yours looks just fine."
