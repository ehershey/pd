__Letter "Seems startmud is setting a umask that is causing all files touched by the driver to be set to u+rw only.  This weekend I managed to build a script that allows players to login to the web interface and upload their own player pics.  This requires read access to the user .o files since I need to get their password for authentication purposes.  But since the MUD is saving files with only u+rw it doesn't work.Is it possible for that to be changed?Whit"
