__Letter "The following are the components of the senses system i designed;    1) /cmds/iron_senses        This is the directory containing the actual senses        commands. Use a call to add this to your search        paths. call me;add_search_path;\"/cmds/iron_senses\"    2) /wizards/ironman/experimental_room.c        This is a room that is setup to use the senses system.        Go to it until you have a room coded of your own using         the system. The old system has been removed and not used        within this room or any other room that inherits things        from the DIR in #3     3) /std/IRON_OBJ_CHAIN        The files in this directory use my system. The Object.c is        the file that actually inherits my iron_senses.c file but        due to inheritance I had to make a mock version of the        mudlib for us to test it with. Inherit these files instead        of the standard ones to use my system.     4) /std/obj/iron_sense.c        This is the actual file that containes the functions to        store the senses information inside the objects. It is        inherited by everything else in the inheritance chain due        to the fact that it's being inherited into Object.c        Use the efun functions() on the file to get a listing of        the functions contained inside of it.==================================================================Thats pretty much it. Inherit the files from the Dir in #3. Addthe search path to your commands. Have fun :)The system is set up to take in both strings and function pointers.==================================================================Ironman"
