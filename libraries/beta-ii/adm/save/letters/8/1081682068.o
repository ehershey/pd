__Letter "\"Eloquently decorated with beautiful objects and colours, Princess Luti's bed chamber is a sight to behold. Objects kind to the eye and touch are here, either breathing or not. Seldom leaving this room, Princess Luti can always be found here, being fawned over by servants, and praised widely for her beauty by other mermaids who come here to simply praise her beauty.\""
