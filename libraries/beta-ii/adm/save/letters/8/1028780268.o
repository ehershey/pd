__Letter " Dude... Get a life. I said I fucking appologized. Get the hell over it. It was fucking months ago. And you just go up and grab my girlfriends \"tit\" and I swear I'll kick your ass. I know you're poor feelings for me, And I'm sorry. Seriously. I'll never do it again, I already talked with John about it and he said in the end it was ok so long as nothing like that happened again, and it hasn't, won't, and I don't appreciate the pointless and stupid abuse about the shit that's in the past. Honestly... let's just drop it and move on our seperate ways.cookie"
