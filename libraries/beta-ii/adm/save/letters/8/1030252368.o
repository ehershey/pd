__Letter "Jake,I thought you would be interested by a full report of what has been going on with PD while you were gone.  I have no doubt that you were delayed in returning somehow and will have lots of questions about what has been going on.Firstly, Faust has been angry with me lately and threatened to kill off my guild.  Well, our guild.  Nothing really happened though, he only seems interested in me and I haven't really been playing for a while.  I mostly idle, chat or code on PD these days.  Wildflower was demoted from co-leadership and then from council because her dragon character suddenly quit my guild and joined Dark Souls, after they were supposedly at war with us.  Enraged that she was demoted before she could explain herself, she quit the guild altogether.  Her excuse was that her dragon character, Hepualahole, was being attacked by Dark Souls--that they were declaringw ar on the dragon race because there was leaking going on in the quest--but this was a load of shit because no dragons died.Nightshade recently made changes to the combat system.  He was asking for some new attacks and I suggested a bunch of cool melee moves (which I know you'll like).  Hopefully they will go in.  I also suggested that we take the XP loss out of PvP deaths so that elite people wouldn't destroy weak people's characters (so far 3 people have quit because of this).  The idea had some support but met too much resistance from level 60s who did not want to give up power.  I know eventually, if we ever want a huge player base (like in the 3d MMORPGs that are pretty popular) we will have to make changes to death but PD is obviously not ready for this yet.Oh, also, it may have been changed since he told me, but according to Ashram, berserkers are the strongest characters!  He said all they really need is skills and constitution to survive raging and that at level 100, a berserker would do like 10k+ a round.  Of course, this is meaningless when a cleric can paralyze you for 10 rounds, but with that much power you could afford to start spending XP on wisdom.Vampires are coming quite nicely.  Nightshade is working on the race, Stormy is working on the class/abilities and I am working on the quest.  I have completed their history and while it is a bit short, I think it is effective.  They are being coded as monsters, so that it is not illegal to kill them and you don't get punnished under the law.  Inferno dumped the quest and quit as an immortal, so I was forced to rewrite it.  When he signed on and asked how it was doing and if it was still the same, I lied and said yes.  I knew he would leak it to his friends, so I'm going to code art of it to look like it's the old one.  Hopefully they'll spend hours searching for nothing.  It would serve them right.  I'm counting on you to keep this secret though.  The quest is going to be very hard but not weirdly hard and impossible like some of the ones on Merentha.  It WILL make sense.As far as the staff goes, they have kind of got a bit into RP and named themselves 'avatars'.  Here is what has changed/you should know:ADMINS------Stormbringer: Most active and authoritative admin.Seeker: Idle 24/7, busy with work.  He leaves Stormy in control.Nightshade: 3rd most powerful, he is nice but seems to be losing interest in PD.IMMORTALS---------  Daos: He is like the event avatar but never does anything.Wraith: Law.  He cybered Wildflower on builders.Detach: They actually let him back.  Haven't seen him in a while though.Whit: Never around.  Aparently he's really sick irl.That's about it for PD.  I heard from Karina last night for the first time in several months.  She was nice as ever.  She's going on a mission for her church though soon.  Got to admire her for that but she will be missed.You better get back soon or I might have to phone your house and tell your mom to go get you.  It's wierd.  I almost forgot about you for a while in July but then when it was August and you were supposed to be back, I realized how empty the net was without you.  Very...  incomplete.  And it's starting to bug me.  If something bad happened to you I would be really fucking mad and upset.  So uh...  come back in one piece, or else.Lev "
