__Letter "Main RoomAn overwhelming sense of comfort envelope the main room of Naktu's home. On first glimpse, it would appear that some sort of maid keeps up the house, as the surrounding furniture and dining table are remarkably well kept and clean. This is surprising, as Naktu hardly stays home. Except for a few framed portraits of his deceased family, the walls are pretty much bare, with little or no color. Naktu's bedroom is located through the adjacent door.Look Portraits = The following images depict various scenes from Naktu's past. One that stands out the most is a family portait comprising of himself, his mother, father, and younger sister. The portraits are partially burnt, most likely from the fire that destroyed Naktu's village...BedroomNaktu's bedroom is but a simple one: Bed in one corner, chair in the other. Naktu has no need for fancy or luxurious items to adorn his room. As expected, his bed is well made and clean."
