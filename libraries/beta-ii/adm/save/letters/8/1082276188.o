__Letter "I've heard about the killing agent has been doing, and I recently talked to him about it (about a day or two ago, after he had pk'd posenda) and told him that I considered what he was doing to be a \"spree\" and that he needed to stop pking people.  As far as I know, he hasnt killed anyone since (he acknowledged my request and said he'd stop).  So...  he *should* stop killing people.  If he does again, let me know and I'll see what's up.                   -Nightshade"
