__Letter "Hrmmm, a rogues Disguise ability would be fun if....When disguised, all the says/emotes came out as the thing/person they are disguised as. example:disguise as EiosYou poke Jaspen in the ribs!jaspen sees: Eios pokes you in the ribs!everyone else sees: Eios pokes Jaspen in the ribsnow it could be abused for says and startin fights, but i think disguised would be enhanced if it used that function on emotes, it would be just a few lines of code in the emote func.Thanks for the fun!"
