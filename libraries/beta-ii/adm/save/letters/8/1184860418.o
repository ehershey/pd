__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Ironman to Ironman Mon Jul 16 10:13:44 2007:-----I have the preliminary code in place on builders. I just need the nod fromyou folks to go ahead and try my little experiment out :)If this works, we will have a whole new dimention to our world opening uphere. I have coded in the following senses and commands for the new system;    smell     taste     feel     listen     look     examine    search    readAll of the above commands will take in the information from the new systemand respond accordingly. You can find the commands in the dir /cmds/iron_sensesand the code for the objects to take in the information in /std/obj/senses.cOnly thing that i will need to do to make this work completely is remove theold senses code from the rooms and the read code from the object.cDo not worry about these changes. The new system will accept the informationpresent in all the old rooms from set_listen() and set_smell(). It will justmake the system MUCH more flexable by allowing them to be coded into ANYobjects our builders desire and not just rooms :) The system has the functionsset_smell() and set_listen() to allow the retro-compatability.The only concern i have is places where builders had to code in add_action()to make a \"read\" command for objects. I would be willing to route out thesebugs to accomidate the new system if the administration wishes it. We couldalso scrape the read part of the system. I have also made it so the system can accept functions as well as strings.I felt it was a needed section of the code since there will be times thatwe want to test conditions to determine what messages are sent back to theplayers.Ironman"
