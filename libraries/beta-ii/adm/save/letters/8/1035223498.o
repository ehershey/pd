__Letter "hehheh, the colors were a bit off... but woo! cool!!!! *laughs* i still haven't gotten up the guts to attempt to color this.. so i printed a copy out, i'm going to do a test run. *smirk* her hair is black.. her eyes are grey, with silver outer rings. her lips are a very deep crimson.. and i doubt she'd be caught dead in purple and green. *snicker* her necklace is onyx.. with rubies inlaid. her skin is light, like porceline.. her dress is almost the color of the mist in the background. her scarf is colored like the night.. her draconic form is just like you colored it ... all misty.. only its eyes are silver, and its mouth/tounge is blue/grey. *wink* try those out!! muahahahaaaaaaaa..... I LOVE YOU ! i'll be online tonight.. (i'm leaving on Wednesday for Illinois..)"
