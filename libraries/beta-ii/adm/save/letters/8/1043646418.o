__Letter "Hey, honey. Are you feeling any better? I sure hope so because I'm feeling like crap. I got sick this weekend. Horrible cough, a sinus headache that hurts like hell every time i turn my head, a stuffy nose, chills, and my throat is so sore i can hardly talk. :/And all this 5 days before the homecoming dance. :(smack rejikSo basically i've been xping like a zombie today and the past few days. I'm finished with all my stats except for wis, which is coming along very quickly. Maybe another week and i'll have my stats all improved to where i want them, my skills maxed out, and level 22. Provided i don't die that is. Well, i guess that's about it for now. It's 10:30pm my time and i'm not feeling well at all, so I'm only going to be on another 30 mins or so. It's an early bedtime for me tonight. *Savannah kisses you sweetly on the cheek (so you won't catch her sickness) and smiles weakly at you before winking and vanishing to the shadows.*"
