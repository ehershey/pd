__Letter "I've  thought of that alreadyIt can find the files (bottlenose_dolphin.c), (great_white_shark.c), and (hammerhead_shark.c) just fine.  They're all in the same directory as (selection_lvl4.c)I'm already aware of the error the system gives me when it can't locate a file and have corrected that part of the problem. If it IS that im not sure what one it can't fine cause that error isn't the one im getting.I'm also sure that (template4.c) can locate (selection_lvl4.c)  its just that theyre giving me the error i told you about in the first mailing bud.If it was that they can't find eachother it gives me the error (cannot locate). I know cause I've gotten that one already and fixed it :PIronman"
