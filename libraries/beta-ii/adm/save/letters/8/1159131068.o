__Letter "I have heavily modified the help system on builder now.It has colors fully active in it's menus and has the topicsI mailed to you about in place. Most of the topics in *tutorialshave been completely revised by me to outline the current functionsand their uses. Please take the time to go review them and giveme some feedback. I need to know if i left anything out.The only one left that i must revise now is the rooms tutorial.Once that one is completed I will be moving into the *codingtutorials.Ironman"
