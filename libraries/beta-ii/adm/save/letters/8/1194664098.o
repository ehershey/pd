__Letter "I was not ignoring your question. I was in the middle of somthing else. I am wondering why you would think you need an admin character. Adminship on PD has to be earned, it is not given easily. Do you wish to apply to be a part of the staff? Do you have experience with lpc coding? I know you have a builder character, have you built a playable area for PD? If you were joking around, forget the questions, only answer them if you were serious about being part of the staff.Stormy"
