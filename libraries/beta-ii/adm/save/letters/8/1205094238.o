__Letter "hey, i've found my way out of the trouble i got myself into. i'm getting settled with my own place, computer and what not and wanna burn some spare time hereany chance i could get you to impliment -something- to help with my sp consumption? this character is bare bones and hasn't had many improvements in a long ass time. not whining, not at all, just stating. i know you're busy with other stuff and if it weren't for you, this game would be lightyears behind what it is. i noticed hep hasn't been on in a while, i know she's very busy in life, and that's totally understandable. thanks man, hope you put some consideration in it.!smokey!"
