__Letter "The new zone by drow has monsters that use AOE. Namely rage and inferno. This ends up with the others monsters in the room stealing my kills and I get no exp. I know the theory was that it would speed up killing the others that are weakened, but in practice it makes no difference. It takes the same number of hits to kill the others if they have recieved one infero or not. However I lose the exp of what I should have killed, and I still need to recover my hp/sp/mp from the battle. If possible can AOE please be removed from these monsters or replaced with single target abilities? Losing exp due to others monsters is a detraction from an otherwise great zone."
