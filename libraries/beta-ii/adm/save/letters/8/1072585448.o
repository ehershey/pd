__Letter "Here's some stuff I came up with just now that might helpout pyromancers... I also have one necro spell.for necros:putrefaction -  makes a putrid aura of death surround you that serves as a light  protective spell and also causes good body damage to anything that  touches you - either level 15 or 40 depends on how strong it isnow pyro spells:flamewall -  makes a wall of fire that surrounds you and causes extra damage  each round to everything you're in combat with, doesn't follow  between rooms - level 18 or soimbue -  gives fire element to a weapon or armour sort of how enchant works  but doesn't raise ac/wc - level 15melt -  causes random piece of worn/wielded eq on target to melt either  partially (lowering ac/wc) or completely (destroyed) and damage  the limb(s) it was on, maybe make this aimable like \"melt goblin helmet\"  - level 16 or 17cauterize -  heal body damage to a single limb but target loses hp and sp  equal to twice the percentage of body damage healed - level 8engulf -  fills area with fire that lasts several rounds burning EVERYTHING,  caster takes about 1/5 of damage to everything else, uses mp each  round it lasts, harder to cast outside - level 30 or 40Also I think it would be good if the weapons and armour we makewith create spell automatically had fire element strengths,and that we should have an automatic resistance to fire, likemaybe equal to our level, level 20 takes 20% less damage?? ormaybe like 2/3 of level.. something like that..Thanks and let me know if I wasn't too clear on something"
