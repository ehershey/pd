__Letter "I have a lot of things done but here is my list of things to do...  I'm hoping to finish a lot of this over christmas but school is really hurting the rest of my time.  I'm fairly confident with getting the actual body of the quest done at this point but I can't expect Nightshade to finish the race and the class before new years...  Anyway, here is a list of things I have to do:- An old monster infested rock town thing, wont be too big but I'm considering having a big random room outer area so when someone sails here they don't get too suspicious at one or two empty rooms.  (Basically you have to know what you're looking for to figure this part out.)- Some sort of heavenly area/Storm plains/whatever.  The name can be thrown around.  It's going to be big but random room with really buff monsters because this is pretty much the part where you are fighting your way to Stormbringer himself (or an avatar of...) to challenge him and become his enemy in body, spirit, mind, etc.- A pretty easy-to-do building that has magical walls preventing you from moving from room to room...  sounds hard but Drackmire already coded the item that disables these fields, so it's only a matter of describing the rooms and adding a couple lines of code.  - Umulos, the 'vampire' home on earth.  Going to be an island of jagged rock (possibly if your str/dex are too low, a random chance of you slipping and dying or receiving massive damage on the rocks if you aren't vampire) and this is the place where the quest is completed, so I want to make it really really nice.  Probably going to have some nasty creatures hiding outside of the gates, but only a deathless/enemy of stormbringer's power can enter...  in fact, I wanted to have it so any ghost who enters is bannished back outside. (because a ghost would be able to navigate any dangerous area)- Finish Aciri/go back and make some changes, so it has the illusion of being a vampire island but nothing actually tells you \"This is a vampire island.\" because there are no vampires before the quest starts...  they're just put there to deceive the unworthy.- Finishing touches to the palace of Seeker.  I REALLY REALLY REALLY want us to have a small event that opens this palace ASAP, because I don't want it to be the only totally obvious part of the vampire quest when it opens on new years.I may have forgot a few things but that's pretty much it.  In terms of play testing, if we run out of time and need to balance vampires, just let me start off as one anyway and play for a couple of months until we make a balance, then wipe me down to level 1...  it's the only fair way to test them without breaking the schedule.Levi"
