__Letter "There is a working version of that daemon on the builders port.  All i need to do is put 1 line in /std/user/save.c and add the line in /adm/db/privs.db  (/daemon/guild_d): UserSaveThe line in privs will give the daemon the uid of UserSave which is needed to read/write in the char dir..  The line in the /std/user/save.c which is seteuid(geteuid(previous_object()));  makes the euid of /std/user/save.c to UserSaveI think it should be totally working now..  Im gonna run further tests on it...  If you would like to try it out do this:on the builders port:finger testy  (notice it has a guild)eval return \"/daemon/guild_d\"->remove_member(\"testy\", \"test\");  (should return 1)finger testy (notice no guild):If you would like to see if anything was changed on testy...  testy's passwd is 55555Whit"
