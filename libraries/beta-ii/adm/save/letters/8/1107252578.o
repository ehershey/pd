__Letter "I love the new sky system. Here's my thoughts on improving it:Add some sort of \"location\" command like ships have.It's often hard to figure out where you are.Make all the places with names landable.I've seen it say I'm over \"desert\", \"citrin forest\", etc but can't land.Make it so we can land on all the small islands too.I checked them and it doesn't even say anything special for them.Arlon seems a bit too far away in the sky for being right next to tirun..Lodos seems like it's not far enough north, maybe the forest to thesouth of lodos just doesn't take up as much room as I thought though.I can't find Rhondale at all, it's (-6, -19) on the ocean, but Isearched the whole west chunk of that continent and can't find it.I think the sp cost should be more like 8 sp per move. As is it takes408 sp (12 sp * 34 spaces) to get from tirun to merk, that's a LOT.I know it's still in beta. But seriously I love flying around now.Great work."
