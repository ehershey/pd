__Letter "So, did u find out what happend... i am almost positive he used a glitch (whether on purpose or just what he was intending to do for his next round), but still a bug/glitch is a bug either way, i am sorry to be whineing about it again, but i really really am sick of ashram, i've reported him for harassment 2 times cause he has killed me 5 times in total, first 2 were within minutes of each other, the 3rd and 4th came about 30mins apart, and now this one. i know there is a holy war but i'm sure harassment still applies, i think the holy war gives a free pk not a constant smacking of the lower/lamer demons. i would be a lot happier if it was a legit death, but it wasn't and i still lost 3 lvls 2 stats and skills... but again... i was looted again.. but this time i had 150k gold on me, rare items, 5 diamonds, but worst of all the Armor of souls... the one off item u sold to me.Anyway, i feel really bad... especially to have to come to u and whine once more, i'm sure u have enough other shit going on, but really what can i dothanks dude."
