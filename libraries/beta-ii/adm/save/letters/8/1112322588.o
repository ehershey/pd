__Letter "I know you're probably not going to read this for a while, but I wanted to wish you luck in school, and I hope everything goes well for you. I'll be around here and there, and hopefully I'll be able to catch you one day you're on. Not sure if it matters too much to you, but don't worry, I'm not gonna divorce you! You're my Daos. <3 :D"
