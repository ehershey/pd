__Letter "Was talking to wraith about adding a tatoo parlor for the guild and wanted to run this idea by you.  Instead of boring plain tatoos that dont do anything, how about magical tatoos that raise a stat, or a skill.  Stat by one or two, skills by 5 or 10 points.  You can only have one of course of the same type.  They would be like runes, maybe not permanent, but if permanent they would be more expensive.  Lemme know whatcha think.Soulfly"
