__Letter "this isnt a mudmail to insult the change you made to flying. i have recently come back since the changes were made and my dex is rather low.so i no longer can fly at all.as you can probably figure out, i am stuck in a loop. i can not get to my class hall (unless there is a way i have not been told yet) and so i can not train my dex.i need some assistance to get out of this loop when ever you have time. i would appreciate it a lot. thanksdelphi"
