__Letter "We need to chat on the areas tom. Im patience just get back to me whenyou got time, Mail me a time/date with 48 hours notice and ill be on.Quite bluntly i would rather not deal with nulvect unless he has thedecency to apologize to me for disrespecting my work like he did.Not gonna rehash my reasons as you know them. There's no reason for younor the mud suffer for his indisgression. To this end, i WILL stay butwould deal with you or daos.Main issue i got is questions on revisions u asked for before i gorewiring the reef and ocean floor.,"
