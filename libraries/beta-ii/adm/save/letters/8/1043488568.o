__Letter "Omg Hermes, if we *both* know what my stats look like why don't you enlighten me? I didn't know you could scan my character profile to check my stats.Simple fact: You are wrong, you do not know what my stats are like. Unless of course you ahve used a bug to find out, in which case you will be reported for bug abuse. Or an imm has scanned me and told you, in which case they can be removed from imm status, since you cannot relay character information witht he player's consent."
