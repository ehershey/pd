__Letter "Eios Kendt's eyes glow a bright white, almost blinding, you get a small glimpseand they seem wolven like, calm yet interesting. He is about 2 and half meterstall with a neatly trimmed goatee, his body built like a brick. You notice manybattle scares from past brawls. On his chest you notice a big tattoo with thewords 'bestia abs natura' written around the face of Gaia and on his leftshoulder a tattoo of a wolf. Just from looking at him you can tell that thereis more to him then what you see, something deep and meaningful... Nature seemsto flow around him like he understands it and it understands him. What could bethis 'something more' you wonder. A glimpse of something hanging out of his aBlack Diamond looks foreign and gives you the impression that he has been tomany places and seen many things. The fresh smell of forest herbs comes alsofrom the Black Diamond, a wierd but nice calming smell. He stands proud withtwo Dragon Slayers sheathed seperatly on his shoulders. He is a confident manwho is known to take on anything or anyone that gets in his way of doing suchhe pleases."
