__Letter "Earlier today Frisky had his password stolen from Primal Darkness and theadministrators of that game used it here to log in and among other thingsempty the Orbis treasury.We don't have time for all you idiots who freely give out your passwords inone way or another.  Frisky is now banished for life, report all alts."
