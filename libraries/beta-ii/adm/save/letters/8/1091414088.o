__Letter "Well, I'm using iptables to deny syn and ack packets that arent on the allowed ports.  any attempts to any other port are logged, and that's the log that I've allowed stormy to download.  If you want a copy, I've got it, but it's about 144MB (lots of attempts at once).  Also, the tech support is being asses about telling me what options they used when they installed apache, and there's no configure.nice file (that stores the options used).  I dont know if I should actually know how to find that out, or if they're really just being jerks.  So, overall, nothing too serious, but admittidly, I'm not the most experienced linux guy out there, so yeah.  If you've got any advice, I'd be more than happy to take it.                    -Paul"
