I can understand if you don't believe me that I have something personal against you, because I know it seems that I do. But with me, I keep mud things separate from I suppose... real life things. Not that we've ever been \"real life acquaintances\". But, every time there's been a problem on pd, I've messaged you on MSN, as if we were \"friends\" or not enemies. I just have something against you as an immortal, and that's all. I have nothing against you in any other way. But from now on, I will not argue with you about anything. As for the pyro code thing, you can talk to Whit, Evolution, or even Pyro himself, Djerr...they'll all tell you that I had nothing to do with that. I would never write such a thing. Never.I don't want you to think that I have something against you personally. I've always liked you, and enjoyed talking to you. There were just times where I felt that you were sort of pushing your immortal status on me and not really having any valid points to make, and that's where I began to lose respect for you. But I was wrong to tell you to just completely leave me alone.I did that out of stress. I don't like drama, I don't like conflict. I just felt that every time we talked, it..it just really stressed me out. I'd rather just be friends with you than have you...never mind.Anyway whether you believe me or not, this is how it is.You go through things in real life, just the same that I do. And I know that sometimes things that you go through in real life affect your actions and... such...on the mud. I am the same way. We both suffer and have joy..and just.. have lives outside of pd. But it's when the bad things happen (for me anyway) in real life, that just bring me down here, and for some reason, I feel like I'm being targetted, and that's my own WRONG. I don't want you to think that I have something out for you, that's all I'm trying to get at here. I never have. -kumi"
