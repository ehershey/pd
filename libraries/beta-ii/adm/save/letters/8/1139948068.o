__Letter "I was told Sticky was arrested for his name. I don't see how that's fair to arrest him for having a name like that. I was trying to give him a gangster-type name. Back in the days a thief like me wouldnt have a name that everyone could get ahold of him with, just a name that he was known for. I think if Sticky is arrested for names, Resolution ought to be too for having a noun as a name. There are a ton others, also. I think it would probably be better to let me have Sticky back rather than arrest all characters with a questionable name."
