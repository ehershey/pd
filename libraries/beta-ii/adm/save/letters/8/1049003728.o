__Letter "Well, it's 10:30pm and you still have not made it back yet. Usually we'd be saying our goodbyes and you'd be headed to work by now. But I've waited for probably 2 hours now, hoping that you would return soon. I did other things online while i waited to keep me entertained. But...*sigh*...i must head to bed now. I can't think of why you weren't on tonight, except for maybe you thought that I wouldn't be able to get online (because of my dad working on the computers and stuff) or perhaps friends wanted you to do things or...*shrug* I don't know. But I suppose I shall do what i can to see you tomorrow. I will be on at my usual time at nights unless something happens. And in that case i will email you telling you so. It's possible i will be on during the day tomorrow, but that's so improbable that i wouldnt count on it. I dearly missed your company tonight, but I suppose i shall go ahead and conclude this mudmail. I love you. Until i see you again,Your princess, your wings, your love,Heather"
