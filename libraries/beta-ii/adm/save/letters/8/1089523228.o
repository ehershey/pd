__Letter "I have just spoken to Bellos and it seems. Bellos, Tchon and Belleqwaya..or some other unspellable name are all unable to connect to Pd.They all apparently live very close together somewhere in Canada and are able to connect to some other muds and not able here.This is the error msg bellos apparently got:MUSHclient!unable to connect to \"Primal Darkness\", code = 10060 (connection timed out)Error occurred during phase: Connecting to world: 217.160.254.143, port 5000..Bellos was also unable to connect to Builders either..\"Tchon said something about a 'gateway' preventing us from getting through\"Seems like an isp thing to me but yeah. They wanted to ask an admin about whats what etc.Ty"
