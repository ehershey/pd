__Letter "Hey Whit, this is me Warrick, I was having a hard time to get a hold of you so I decided to mail you. I was hoping that I could get my Warrick character restored, I know you might have your reasons and your probably sick of me, but I didnt do anything wrong and I know you asked me that day and said \"Why?\" and my answer was due to problems with the class I have been playin for quite a while now and all of a sudden changes were made to downgrade us further and I am pretty sure you dont give a rats ass but If you were still a player you'd kinda be ticked for a second downgrade on your main abil and speed of xping even when the class was doing fine and Nulvect did admit at the time (after i suicided) that there is something up with cripple but I put lots of work in that character I have been a player on this mud for 2 years and I dont want to just leave the MUD I have friends here too and I would like to still stick around. I dont want to get on anyones back or anything but you guys did let Tia come back even with her punishment by removing some of her stats she scripted and there was still some mercy shown on her. I am sure one of the reasons was because the players are what keeps the MUD running and I dont know if you care if you guys lose another player or not but if you really feel it necessary to not restore Warrick back by all means thats fine. You admins/immortals have your reasons and I understand I must be being a nuisance of some sort by pettying with stuff in admist of your own problems and I am sorry for bothering. But if you cannot please do me a favor and just block my IP because Its hard for me to not log on and say wassup to some ppl and I dont want to continue playing the MUD since I have wasted much time into that one character alone.Thank you for your time,Pal"
