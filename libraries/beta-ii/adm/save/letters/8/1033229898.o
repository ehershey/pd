__Letter "I have this idea.. and I'm really afraid you're gonna laugh.. so if you do.. don't tell me, ok?Gypsy's Curse: any one that offends the gypsy has a curse placed on them.. to teach them their mistake. the curse can be removed by that gypsy or a gypsy of higher power.now the actual attack of this would be like say someone kills me.. or offends me or something.. i have to find them in a non-safe zone and <curse> them.. the curse would SLOWLY start to build up their body damage.. I'm talking like.. 1.5% increase per minute/round.. something like that.. ya know? it can be cured down.. but it will just continue to increase from whatever it's cured from.. that way it's just REALLY annoying and bothersome.. but doesn't have to be deadly.. unless they don't realize it's increasing.if they want it removed they have to either come ask the gypsy that cast it to forgive them or find a gypsy higher than the gypsy that cast it and get them to remove it.it could also be cast on mobs and make xping a bit easierjust an idea for a cool attack.. I don't think it's too powered because it obviously won't cause an instant death (like backstab and the other wonderful attacks of the land) and it stays in character.don't laugh :)Sugarcandy"
