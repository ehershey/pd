__Letter "Whit,Darksoul, Unholy, and Forsaken will have struck a treaty soon.I will need a meeting hall soon after that is finalized so if you can have a room ready for us like you have with all the guilds that would be great.I will pay for the extra room out of my guild treasury. Make the toom glum and dreary since it is the meeting place of all the evil in PD.Thanks! I will let ya know when its ready!."
