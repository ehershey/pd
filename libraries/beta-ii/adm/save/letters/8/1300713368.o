__Letter "What happened was that Bellos promoted me to guild leader and I promoted Sopboo. He immediately kicked me and Bellos out of the guild, announced on newbie line that both Bellos and I were no longer unholy, but later readded me. I thought on it, slept on it, and decided that I couldn't shake the feeling of betrayal from how both Sopboo and Thaedrin acted when I was promoted, so I left. I just can't get betrayed like that and still be willing to be loyal. So, as much as it saddens me, I am no longer Unholy. I still like all of y'all and want to keep playing with you guys, but I just can't be part of a guild that does things like that. -Sugar"
