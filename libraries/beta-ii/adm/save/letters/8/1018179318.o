__Letter "I just want you to know how special today was to me.I really enjoyed spending most of the day partying, talking and doing other things *wink* with you.  Impreza marrying An'furnee was just the icing on the cake.Ever since i said i just want to be yours on the mud  i don't seem to have a problem about the marriage thing, but i needed you to ask without too much proding from me.  I don't  know why, i guess i alway let the age difference get to me, but you have alway shown me more care and affection than anyone my age has and i just stopped bringing that wall up and trying to push you away and most of the time that is what i was doing. Seeing you, just seems to make my day that little bit brighter, you can always make me smile and sleep always comes easier after i talk to you at night*hugs and kisses**hugs and kisses**hugs and kisses*WispPS hope you had fun at the party"
