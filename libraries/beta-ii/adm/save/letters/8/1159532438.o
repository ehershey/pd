__Letter "At that point, I knew nothing of a plot to kill you. I told you the truth.If I knew, you would've heard a far more cryptic answer from me like 'I really can't say'. Perhaps with a wink wink and nod nod thrown in foremphasis. I wouldn't set you up. If you don't believe me, though, that isentirely up to you. I still don't have any facts on who did what to you.I will check things out and see what I see. Still your friend even if you arent mine,James"
