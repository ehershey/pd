__Letter "I was wondering if I still get to play as the first vampire character, or if that idea is scrapped?All I can say is...  pretty please.  I am the best RPer ever and you would be proud of me.Ummmm...  lets talk about this!  If things have changed, I understand, but it would make me very happy.Leviathasp.s. I have a week more of hardcoreness and then two more exams and during Christmas break I can work with Daos on our area.  I'm pumped."
