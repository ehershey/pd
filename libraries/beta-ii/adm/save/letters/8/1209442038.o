__Letter "unfortunatly, you do need to stay on your character CB to serve your time, I was gagged on Carina and you can still emote to let people know you're gagged (type gag and people will know if they're in the same room as you).  I fully stand by nulvect because this is how the rules of gag have always been and I don't feel they should be changed just because you want to send tells.  It's punishment for having said/done things over public lines that should not have been.  The more you are on CB, the quicker your gagged punishment will come to an end.  That's just the way it is, and I do not feel that nulvect has anything \"up his ass\" as you so put it, he's doing his job.  I'm sorry, I know this is not what you want to hear, but it's the way it is.Amun"
