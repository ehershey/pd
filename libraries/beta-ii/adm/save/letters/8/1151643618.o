__Letter "Like the post says, I'm leaving... as an admin, anyway.I might still hang around as a player, though I would prefer that none of you told anyone else, especially certain players and imms who would go blabbing it to everyone else.If I do, it would be under the name Garret, which was the name that I used for Levi's RP thing, though he didn't do much. I already suicided that character a while ago, and I'd wait a bit before making him again, so as to not arouse suspicion.Thanks guys."
