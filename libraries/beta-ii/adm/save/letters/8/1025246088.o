__Letter "Just so you know, I put the list in SAB, for my desert.  I'm brain warped, and I hope that is enough.  Everyone was giving me sentences that was similar to the ones I already have.  Sorry, I had to borrow other people's brains to get it done  :P.  I'll be on 2:30 my time, which I belive is 5:30 your time..not sure, but I think I'm close.  And as far as your clog problem, when you clear it, and this is coming from my building manager when we had the same problem, you might want to get a drain strainer to catch hair...and buy bleach and pour it down twice a month and let it sit before rinsing it out with water.  Might want to check into this if your pipes aren't metal...cause I don't know what it will do to plastic.  We haven't had a problem since.... :)Hope to see ya on tomorrow  :)"
