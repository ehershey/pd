__Letter "I have been meaning to contact you guys for awhile..I work odd hours and haven't been able to get the opportunity to complain about my order.  I am VERY unhappy..First of all it was supposed to take 1-2 days delivery, I ordered on the 20th of November and did not receive my product until December 1st when the delivery I paid for was supposed to take 1-2 days and it took over 7 business days.  Secondly, I finally receive my Archos AV500 that I paid over $600 dollars for and it does not work out of the box.  What's up with that?   tried everything..I called Archos and walked through some test procedures and they declared it DEFECTIVE.  They told me to contact my vendor so I am finally doing so..I would like a new one shipped to me immediately I shelled out a lot of money for something brand new and it does not even work?  I feel that maybe I got a lemon..and this kind of thing happens from time to time..And that much I understand but I would like to take care of this as soon as possible before the holidays.  I do not know the procedure for this matter but I imagine you ship me a new one and I put the old one in the box that you sent with the new one and I send it back to you?  Please call me at 360-394-6360 and let me know what I have to do to get this situation fixed or email me back.Thank you.- Chris Branca."
