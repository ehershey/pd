__Letter "Hey, Stormy.  Here's the vampire history, if it can be incorperated into the story that has been written.  'The deathless' is the first vampire, so the end of this story actually takes place in the future.  For history purposes, the term 'vampire' was given to the deathless by mortals.    Before time, before the beginning, several things became aware.  Among these, third of many, darkness was born.  Darkness was the greatest of all things, conquered only by light.  A mother to the entire universe, she surrounded all.  Eons passed as darkness watched.  Unable to communicate with anything, she simply observed and repaired the damage done to the universe by the harsh light of the stars.  She was quite content.  She was complete.  But as time passed, her consciousness began to degrade.  She knew everything and was a part of all things, anticipating all, a maddening existence for any sentient life.It was at the end of darkness' awareness that death came to claim her mind.  In an indescribable moment, darkness and death created a new being.  The deathless.The deathless was a corporeal being, a new awareness that carried with it the vast knowledge of darkness.  As a descendant of death, it would exist until the end of reality.  This is the origin of the deathless.Leviathas"
