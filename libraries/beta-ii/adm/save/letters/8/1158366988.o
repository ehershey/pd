__Letter "Yes, a friend of mine named Escobar said that you were the cleric to come to if I needed to be resurrected into another race. I was wondering if sometime I could meet you online here and have you resurrect me into a giant. I've found out that strength is what makes a scout tick when it comes down to damage. I am a pretty good level so I don't really want to start over. So if you could possibly do that I would be highly greatful. I live in Tn, and the exact time here is 7:36 pm. I hear that you live in Australia, so I'm sure it's slightly off.Thank you for your time,Ulfric"
