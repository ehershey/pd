__Letter "here's what i wrote to kumiunfortunately, its my job to monitor lines and deal with players. Regardless of how you'd like it to be, that is how it is. I will continue to do what i have been doing no matter what your opinion of me is. I am sorry you think i have a personal vendetta against you, that is entirely unfounded. Any other immortal, admin, or player could tell you that. Nightshade backs me in this as does Stormy and the rest of the immortals."
