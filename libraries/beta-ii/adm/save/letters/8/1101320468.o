__Letter "Unholy was sold because all members were inactive for more than 60 days. Unholy was given to you and set because only the leadership was inactive.Since you were already a member of unholy, you got it for free. We make it a point to try and revive old guilds before selling new ones. Vlad was not included because vlad was over 60 days idle and had no real email address we could contact him at.Stormy"
