__Letter "My love, I am so sorry I have not been around, I too want to see your face. I have been on many adventures keeping me away from this place. If you must move on I would be saddened. Yet, I would understand. You will always be my love, and my best friend. I see you have grown in your levels. I am sorry I have not been around. Empyreanps. I am sorry, I have been trying to save as much money as I can (not doing that good at it) and have had to cut down on internet. Sorry I have not been around. I hope you have been good. I see you are in another guild. I am thinking of just giving in and paying for interent, 40+ bucks a month kinda kicks, when I am trying to save money. At work we have had pay cuts, and no new hires, stuff like that, internet is just another expense. *sigh I do miss mudding. "
