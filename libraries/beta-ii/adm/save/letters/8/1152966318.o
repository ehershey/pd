__Letter "hey stormy, luna - i have been going through a vicious time here at home, and was wondering if either of you had any advice for my situation. My parents are coming down on me very hard - for being 23, pursuing art, and struggling to find a part time job. They paint a picture of me that is lazy and inconsiderate , and very irresponsible. I feel as though I am coping as best I can with my fibromyalgia and painting while trying to find a job and work towards independence (obviously needed - get me out of this house!). I was close to panicking earlier in the week when i received an ultimatem from my father telling me that i was not allowed to go anywhere until i found a job. I recently attended a pain rehabilitation clinic, in which they stress the importance of balance in your life - balance of work, leisure, and play time. I am really confused and I am lost as to how to best approach my parents. I'm looking for an external view and opinions. any suggestions? -Azzy/Jenna"
