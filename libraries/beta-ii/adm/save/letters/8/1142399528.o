__Letter "after i left you said he logged off before he signed on...this is incorrect.  It celary states on the 2nd proof that Smite is no longer link dead, and then stats shadimar has gone link dead.  That is multiplaying, RIGHT AFTER he says \"fuck it I'm multi'n\" That is CLEARLY against the rules and it is clear to me that daboura is not going to do his damn job.  He arrested this dude micha for scription, but he isnt arresing smite for multiplaying? what about his harassment? what about him cussing in every damn thing he said? It is obvious to me, that the law is not being distributed fairly.  The proof is there, but it looks like it doesnt matter if we cheat..i will keep that in mind when i decide i want to test the whole multiplaying thing"
