__Letter "Venenum says: Azzy lead me to believe that my feelings were being reciprocated, when they really wern't. That surprised and hurt me. I wondered if the whole Dab' thing was just an effort to send me some kinda signal- but that was wrong, too. I realised she and he were for keeps and got over it. My priority now is to prevent it from happening again. However, my confusion and distress- words said when I was hurting- caused a whole lot of drama. Helena was just trying to protect me- she's only ever had my best interests at heart and I thank her for that- but she is a very emotional person and perhaps took what I said out of context. The end result is: Everyone in this room (except, maybe, NS) has pretty much been upset in some way by this whole series of events. There is no blameless party and no party which is entirely to blame."
