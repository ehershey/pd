__Letter "I have redone most of the ocean system.  You will be able to look at other ships inside of your little room.  I will show you and tell you all the details of the new system later.  Its on builders, but its really different internally of how the old one works.  The only code from the old one is the map, which I changed nothing on.  What I really have left to do is add beach and dock support.  Also, with this new code, im gonna make it where you can put monster ships, (ships like pirate ship on merentha), on the map so you can board them.Whit"
