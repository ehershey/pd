__Letter "Morgana has outright insulted you, me, piehl, and knuckle. I've asked nul if this is grounds for removal, as it should be.Frisky insulted piehl, called him a pawn and telling him he is just being used. He also stands behind morgana in everything he does. He really doesn't seem like the type of guy Forsaken needs. I didn't remove him cause I wanted to get your opinion."
