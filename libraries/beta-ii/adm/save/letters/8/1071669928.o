__Letter "I don't have much experience with songs or how they work, it will take me a little longer to get any done. Conventional spells and abilities will need to take priority somewhat, as I will be able to complete them faster, and thus get more 'work' done.Sorry. I'll get to them though, I just can't guarantee when."
