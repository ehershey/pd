__Letter "Hey, honey. I've only got a minute online so I'm gonna be quick. There's some real life stuff going on right now that's really important atm. So I don't know when I'll be on. Hopefully within the next week, but I can't guarantee anything. Until then, I love you and I'll talk to you when I get back.Savannah"
