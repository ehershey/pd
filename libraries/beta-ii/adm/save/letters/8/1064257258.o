__Letter "not fun. The evening itself went off without a hitch, but i'm spiralling down nostalgia lane. Not that i have any feelings for the boy .. Its more of a 'why in the heck was i ever with that jerk' trip ... and feeling somehow belittled for ever having been involved with him. *puff* i'm very introspective right now... probably will be in a strange mood until the end of the week - to warn you. "
