__Letter "\"Beautiful\"So beautiful is this perfect hourWhich hath roused our blood through time. Now this moment in union ardorShall see our heart-enjoinment's primeSo pure is this matched affectionWhich hat run its course abreast.Now this congress gains directionAs our souls join in one flesh.So priceless is this veiled purityWhich hath tempered our courtship thus far. Now this pearl saved for matrimoneyShall be giv'n o'er to the love you are.Such a time as this as ne'er beforeAnd in this time beautiful."
