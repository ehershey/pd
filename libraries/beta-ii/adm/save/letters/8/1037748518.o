__Letter "I'm sorry I couldn't get on yesterday.  Faust took me to a dinner and a movie, and before I knew it I was shopping for my sisters and brother for christmas.  I needed to get it done before next monday cause my grandparents is gonna be in the area, and this will save me money for shipping.  We'll have to get together another time."
