__Letter "Now that I have more time, even though it was a joke, a favor, whatever, some of the players, as you have seen, griped about changing the title thing. Personally, I know you ment nothing about it other than a joke. And really, I don't much care though it causes a big scene as you saw when a staff member breaks the rules, even something small and stupid. Next time, if you would please, just let em know it was a prank and not something you were doing for someone else. I know my mail was short, but I had little time and 5 players all sending me constant tells. I did not mean to be abrupt or mean or anything. Running this place is a real pain sometimes is all and players can really put it over on anyone. Anyhow, just a mail to let you know I will get any link up on the website you want and one in the credits as well if you will let me know what you want on it.Also, I need to know where to send the money for the domain renewal and I am wondering if you are gonna keep it in your name.Hope to see you on this evening ;)StormyStormy"
