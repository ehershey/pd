__Letter "You were gagged for swearing on the newbie line repeatedly, so what I'm going to do is release you from your gag tomorrow.  That will be three days without the lines.  When I do this, I don't want to see you talking on any lines other than your guild line for 30 days.  You may use says.  If I catch you talking on any lines, the gag will be put back on til daos decides to remove it.  Do you agree to these terms?  If I remeber correctly, I remove the gag the last time and told you to be good...there will be no third chance with me.Hep"
