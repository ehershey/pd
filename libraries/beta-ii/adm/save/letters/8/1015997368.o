__Letter "I bugged boost a few times, but lemme elaborate cause its a pretty serious balance issue and i didnt talk about it well before.Boost is a very serious balance issue for fighters in general, especially raknids... one of the fighter balance things i noticed was that slash cost too much sp to be very useful in combat. Rush or whirl was the main move which was good for damage when combined with normal attacks. Slash was nice for arenaHowever with boost a paladin can slash non-stop and only have to boost himself every few rounds (I contantly rub stones so i always have mana and boost 120 gives me about 1k sp). This means it makes fighters overpowered in generalCombined with raknid slash its insane... my slash does up to 1k (i insta-kill knights in lodos) and cause of boost i can use slash as my main exp move instead of whirl.My recommendation would probably be to remove slash from paladins all together and give them a weak spell in its place..And btw cripple damage is kinda high... i can do over 300 with it lol-- Ashram"
