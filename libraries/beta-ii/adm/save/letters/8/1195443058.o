__Letter "I think it would be better if each guild had a seperate ahll in the guild town. I know it is extra work but it would flush out the town quite a bit and make much more sense. I am hoping to turn this town into a trophy to be won in monthly guild wars in a new arena for just such purposes, which will be conected to the guild town when it gets done.Stormy"
