__Letter "A large cavern overhead is covered in crystals.Thick crystal pieces stick up from the floor at every angle.The walls are all bare rock.Hundreds of grooves run the height of the wall, etched by centuries of dripping water.One especially bright crystal seems almost to glow.A lone mushroom grows out from the side of a stalagmite.Crystalline stalactites glitter dangerously overhead.A large rounded area has formed in the rocky ground.Tiny pools of water dot the floor....just meant as lines to be used wherever, hope they help."
