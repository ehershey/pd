__Letter " have heard from several of you that the connectivity issues are gettingunbearable ever since the move to a new provider. I just wanted to let youall know you're not the only one hurting as it also hurts my daily businessfor supporting remote server sites for my commercial customers.The original connectivity problem I had -- my old provider (Waycross Cable)was no longer going to offer minimum of 135k for upload speed. It also seemsthat their hardware \"upgrade\" really fubar'd a lot of residential andcommercial account systems, including VPN tunnels. Right now, nearly 2/3rdof the city cannot use the Internet via Waycross cable as a provider -- andthat's not good. As a result, I was forced to find a new provider.These are the changes that are taking place from the migration from my oldprovider to Bellsouth Business DSL Xtreme 3.0 service:Old provider: 1.5 MB down (server to inet); 450k up (inet to server)New provider: 3.0 MB down (server to inet); 315k up (inet to server)With the changes, the following will most likely happen: Speed to the serverwill drop a little bit (i.e. connecting, ftp/sftp of files to the server).The download speed from the server to the Internet increased, which mightprovide a bit faster response from the server back to your game clients andplayers -- once everything is ironed out.Bellsouth and I discovered this morning that I have a faulty DSL filter thatwas shipped with my installation package, thus I am having ALOT of static inthe line inside the house (both voice and data) -- thus a lot of connectiondrops at this time. Bellsouth is shipping a replacement filter (UPSOvernight) to replace it. Once I get it in place, then I will test it out tosee if it improves connectivity.Do note, my old provider was strictly a plug-n-play setup, while for DSL youhave to setup bridging on the modem then PPPoE inside the router for theconnection to be established correctly for routing TCP/UDP ports, etc. Imight also have to tweak the MTU (Maximum Transmission Units) forconnectivity, so it's going to be a bit of trial and error for the next fewdays."
