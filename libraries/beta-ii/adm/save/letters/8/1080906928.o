__Letter "i tried to exhaust every option before coming to you about this one, because i know you don't really have a lot of time to muck around with my crappy code, so i'll just get on with it.the guard mob in \"/wizards/helena/nushae/mon/guard.c\" seems to be fine. he's wielding his spear, but he just won't wear his bracers. i don't know why.i changed the this_object()->force_me(\"wear bracers\"); to wear all, wear armour. i changed the whole line to command(\"wear bracers\") and it didn't work. command(\"wear all\") and wear armour didn't work either.i have no clue why it won't work :-\\btw, thanks for helping me last time :P"
