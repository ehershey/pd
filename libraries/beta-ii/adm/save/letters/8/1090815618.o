__Letter "I don't want to pk anyone, and im not about to pk anyone. just the last time i got called a traitor, i was pk'ed :P. i was just saying that if did come under attack, i would either fight back, or run. I realise that by leaving the Illuminati, i have become a potential pk target to the illuminati guild, but i had to do what i felt was right.  -Ka Wo Tsuke TekudasaiP.S. i didn't leave illuminati because of you ;) :P i left because of the actions of some of the other players."
