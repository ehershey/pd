__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Jynteral to Empyrean Sun Sep 28 19:32:30 2008:-----The times of Darkness are heavySomething inside of me, stirs knowing the Jesus loves meThe darkness dissappears.How I thought I was always aloneHow can I be with Jesus on the throne.How my fears easily consume meand make me run awayBut Jesus is always watching and running by my side.Because I was never alone, never aloneAnd He is always with meWhen I am falling down, he picks me up and holds me in his armsWipes away my tears and takes away my fearsLets me know I am his son.You are never aloneYou are never aloneYou are never aloneYou are nev ev ev ever alone With Jesus."
