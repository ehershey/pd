__Letter "I've got nulvect set up with ftp access, and consequently made a few permissions changes in the primal dir.  The primal user is now a member of the \"pdlib\" group.  Nulvect is in this group as well, and you can adjust his security appropriately (he isnt a member of primal, so you can adjust it as needed).  For now, I've given him read/write to beta-ii and nbuilders.  His root is the library directory.  I've also taken away write from the /adm dirs of each port.  Any questions let me know."
