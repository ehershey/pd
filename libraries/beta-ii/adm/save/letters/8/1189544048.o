__Letter "Mr. Fred Rothert,	My name is Samantha Smith and I am an IPFW student in the F300 Invitation to Teaching class.  I am writing to inform you that I have signed up to complete my 15-hour field experience during your 10th grade English classes.  	Please allow me to tell you a bit about myself and my background; I have worked in elementary and high schools in Mesa, Arizona.  At the high school I had the pleasure to work with the Special Education department (specifically with the Hearing Impaired); this is where I was first introduced to the inclusion program.  I have always been interested in becoming a teacher, my only dilemma was subject matter: English or Mathematics.  As it stands, I have decided to major in English and minor in Math.	When it comes to the observation, I know that you have I-STEP testing throughout the coming week, but I thought I would inform you on the days I am available: anytime on Tuesday's, Thursday's, and Friday's.  Please let me know what times work for best for you on these days. 	I look forward to meeting you and observing your class.  I hope that I hear from you soon and that all goes well.Thank you,Samantha S. Smith"
