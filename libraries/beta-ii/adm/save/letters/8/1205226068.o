__Letter "From what I hear, sleep is a good thing. :) Least, someone I know,not naming anyrayna names, tells me. :) I pray that justice isserved, no more, no less. Community service sounds waaay less. So,we will see what we will see. I hope you slept well as you can't read this til ya wake up. (See, I'm smert!) Work is approachingits end. I fasted tonight. Wasn't so bad. :) Tomorrow is my superlong day with the two classes. If I am blessed, maybe I will getto see you. If not, I am still blessed anyway and we will speakwhenever the opportunity arises. Be well, love.Completely yours,James"
