__Letter "Hey there. Found out late last night that I have to fly to Cincinnati on Thursday morning, returning 2/20 (getting home around midnight).I'll probably have SOME internet access, but I'll be on the company's dial-up, which means it'll be painfully slow.If you have the opportunity, email is best (the bobug@yahoo.com address). If I'm in the office, I'll be on MSN/AIM when I can be. Just remember that they monitor everything.Just wanted to you know where I'm vanishing to. Going to be pretty jam-packed week, doing testing. It'll be nice to get work done, and not be pulled onto my other project for the week.However, that's a long, boring story I doubt you want to hear. :)How are you? What's going on? How are things doing? How's work? Is the situation resolved with the lady? How's the weather been? (almost hot here... in the 40s!!)Hope to talk to you soon-H"
