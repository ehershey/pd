__Letter "Well, my name means inhospitable. Your name means the opposite. Kinda reminds me of the yin and the yang, fire and ice. Aquaand Velva. The two parts coming together to making somethingfreakin' awesome. I will have a cap for you for next time Isee you. And maybe something else?Take care, sweet lady.Ax"
