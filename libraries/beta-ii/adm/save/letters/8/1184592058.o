__Letter "Im normally around during the following times;   Mon - Fri  ... 9am -> noon  EST   sundays    ... 9am -> 8pm   ESTI work as a manager for a homeless outreach in NYC in the evenings.I leave home roughly around noon each day. Sometimes i can squeezesome time in during my lunch hours tho (7pm -> 8pm). I just need toknow ahead of time when you can come around.BTW. I have a project im working on for PD. What would you think ifi could design a system that would allow ALL objects to hold info forALL the senses ?? I'm not talking the half-baked way that the roomscurrently allow sounds and smells. I'm saying a system by which wecan have our builders defining smells, tastes, textures, sounds andsights on ALL objects. Think of it like the set_items() coding forrooms but one for each sense. I would also have corrosponding commandswritten up to access this information.Do not worry. It will be able to accept retro coding from the set_smell()and set_listen() coded into the rooms already :)I can easily extend this technique to include a system for \"read\" and\"search\" for objects too :)If you like the concept, I'll start coding it into builders. You,Daboura/Daos and I can run it thru it's paces once i have it in place.Ironman"
