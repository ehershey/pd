__Letter "I have rewired some items on builders to allow better control overcertain issues. These changes are ment to allow builders bettercontrol over their files and grant access to there objects forother builders.I have designed a WORKROOM inherit with functions that controlthe security system. Those functions allow the builders to definewho will have what level of access to their directory.The tests will be done by the four security screens in the file/adm/simu_efun/security_screen.cI want approval from either Whit or Stormbringer before i fullyimpliment these modifications. They're all ready to go and onlyneed to be wired into master.c and BuildSecure.c for them to takeroot. I can handle doing it myself but i wish for the OK fromone of them before i do something so drastic to the builder's port.The two files that control the system are the security_screen.c andthe /std/room/wizard_room.cIf you wish for a more detailed explination just mail back to me.You will find that my new system will allow builders to lock theirobjects from other coders and/or allow scan/read/write access tothem. Please reply Whit or Stormbringer.I don't want to play with master.c or BuildSecure.c without someonewho has server access being handy in case something unforseen happensIronman"
