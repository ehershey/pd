__Letter "Cool!  Good to hear that they will finally be done at some point.I am toying with ideas for new class or race for the area, and I was wondering if the person who is doing vampires used my design, or if they started from scratch.  I thought of a cool race for the big HP thing in my vampire design, but if that's incorporated into the ones that are being done now, I'll think of something else.ThanksLevi"
