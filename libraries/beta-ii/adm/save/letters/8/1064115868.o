__Letter "the only times i ran accross blind were in the sewers and lodos :/ although i was psistorming :P. i don't actually recall him being in the room _ever_ when i was psistorming, so i wouldn't have even initiated combat. It seems to me that Blind just wants a war, and well who are we to deny him ;). rest asured, if i get the chance, i will smite him good. :) - Tsuke."
