__Letter "I know and trust him.Cortoth, Nesoo and Nulvect were the three that taught me LPCwhen i started with you guys. Granted i moved on rapidly fromthere but i know Cortoth has a firm grasp on the LPC language.I just want him as an arch so that he and I can get the projectsany builders are working on up to speed. I'm not talking rootaccess. Root should be limited to the handful that have it nowand no more ( You, stormbringer, daos, daboura and myself) Noothers really need root access on builders.Quite honestly him and i design some wicked things when webrainstorm together >:) Ya seen what i was able to do on myown for the builders. With him working there two, I know wecan get builders working like a well oiled machine for youguys.While im mailing you, i got a few questions for you ;     1) Is there any way that i can get a listing of available        efuns ?? I was able to get the sfuns mearly by doing        functions(\"/adm/obj/simulefun.c\") but i need a listing        of available efuns so i can write up those tutorials.     2) There are a number of sfuns tutorials in /adm/doc i        need you to write for me. They are in regard to the        mud's linking procedures. I think it's a good idea        to document these (in the /adm dirs) for any future        admins that need this kind of information. Anything        in the /adm/doc dirs will not show for _man.c or        _coding.c if the person is not an arch or higher.      3) Is there any way we can get the mudlib updated on         builders ?? I want an updated /std dir before i         start doing the lfuns. It would make no sense         for me to write tutorials and the functions work         differently over here. I'd be willing to move them         over personally if i had the ability to FTP them over.         I of course dont, so im requesting help from someone         who does :)      4) I would also like the /cmds updated with the new         stuff from nulvect. The builders can not setup their         monsters to use them if we dont HAVE them to set on         the monsters and use in trials and p-testing.One final issue i want your input on, P-testing. I can easily setupa position for p-testing. I want permission from you and stormybefore i do it tho. The system would be as follows;       1) Position only gets scan access to the files. The only          commands they would have beyond mortals would be the          following;               summary     objcmds     stat     commands       2) The postions would be by invitation only from Daos,          myself and cortoth (if you let me add him as arch).       3) A LAW review is done on the person. Make sure theyre          not a habitual troublemaker.       4) Once they pass the LAW review and get p-tester status,          they would go into the p-tester pool. From this pool,          a builder may grant them access to go testing their          projects.        5) THey would not have access under my security grid if           the builder doesnt grant access.I think its a good idea to have a p-tester stage in the reviewingprocess so we can weed out the no-brainer bugs that keep poppingup in older projects. It would help us cut down on having tobacktrack later.Ironman"
