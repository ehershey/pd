__Letter "things for you to look in on;   1) Micky's got a partial area he wants us to look over.      Please take a look at his directory. I've been teaching      him the LPC language and he seems to be picking it up.   2) Sensory system is complete. Do the following to check      it out;           a) goto /wizards/cortoth/iron_senses           b) enter the room stored there. It has the room's              senses stripped off it so my system will work.           c) call daos;add_search_path;\"/cmds/iron_senses\"           d) clone the objects in the directory    3) TUtorials for coding are done. Tutorials for sfuns are done.       Please go check them out.    4) Talked to Stormbringer. He told me he will be supplying us       with an up-to-date copy of the mudlib. Once he does, I will       replace the builder port's mudlib one file at a time. This       way i can control any security changes we need inserted.       It will also let me setup the functions for _summary.c into the new       mudlib.Mail me back with you input on these items.Ironman"
