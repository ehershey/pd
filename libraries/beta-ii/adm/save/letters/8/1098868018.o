__Letter "Note that the last mail was solely regarding your mail.I feel I have to say this, since nobody seems capable of keeping things in context lately.As for making suggestions.. I do. All the time. I post on boards.I report bugs with the bug command. I report typos with the typo command.Nothing, not even obvious and detailed and important bug reports, hasever been accomplished by way of those three channels.Occaisonally, when I talk to someone on a line and already have thespell written up (if that's the case), something gets done.The next part of your mail is about how I don't respect people whovolunteer their time. Maybe you should have read my posts a littlecloser. The whole point was this: How am I supposed to know theyare volunteering their time if they never say that they are??Don't tell me that being an imm implies that they are, becausewe both know that that is not necessarily the case.As to \"announcing regularly\"... I can recall a single time before thelast few days that I said anything about any of the imms. If I'm notmistaken, it was about you. Maybe that's why you're so fired up.To close, I never really expected the imms to care about my opinions.It seems they surprised me and cared way too much about the wrong one."
