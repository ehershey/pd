__Letter "Now again i'll say i don't know the ins and outs of how things work, i don'tunderstand how to make cool spell or abilities.  I'm an ideas sort of personand basically that is that.1.  Ointments could be changed so that they ooze like stone.  Which would helpthe classes that can only use sp abilities.2.  As Red Dragon's aren't stupid (i have nearly more mp than hp and i've notspent alot on wis/int) after level 50 and with 50 plus int and wis, maybe 75they could gain the ability to boost not huge amounts like a cleric but enoughto sustain like paladins.  This would have to be trained as a skill from 0.3.  After level 50 and with int/wis 50+ they have enough nouse to sustain theirflow of sp, halving the amount of sp used.4.  After level 50 and with int/wis 50+ they could have the ability to 'Sap'their mp into sp therefore being able to use the useless mp.I did have another one, but it's late and i can't remember what it was.Thank you for your time.Wisp"
