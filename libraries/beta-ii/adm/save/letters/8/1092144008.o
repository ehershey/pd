__Letter "I spoke with crem on MSN. He said he got the information (rumor) over an IRC chat channel. He wont tell me who it is who he got the info. from to protect that person. They are a PD player, however. I told him that protecting that person will only get him into trouble, etc. etc. He also knows that you are unhappy about it as well.  -,-* we'll see if anything turns up."
