__Letter "Hey sweet lady. Today, I stayed up late playing video games, heh. Then, I slept and when I woke, I went to see a movie with Russell.I saw Walk Hard. I thought it was pretty funny. Would've ratherseen the Rayna Paisley story, but ah well. :) I hope you had anexcellent day! Maybe we'll talk soon. Take care.Love,James"
