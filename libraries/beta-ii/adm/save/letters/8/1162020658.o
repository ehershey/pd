__Letter "I have been really busy with school, law, theatre, yearbook, and a relationship on top of it... but I am still hoping to finish coding my area.  My builder is Vian and although I haven't been playing Primal Darkness, I still do plan and hope to code and finish my area.  I've been trying to find a good mac client too :/  since it's hard to mud on a mac with all the crap clients.  Thanks!"
