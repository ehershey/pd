__Letter "Hi, one thing I was going to say is, please don't wait up for me.You know you have me and I'm not going anywhere.What time we would have together would be quality time anyway.So, please make sure you keep your routine and get your sleep.I'd rather you sleep than wait up for me or listen for my music whenI get on here.  If you go to sleep, you can always mail me and that willhold me over until we can be on together.I'd be happier knowing you had sleep.  Hugs,LoveMe"
