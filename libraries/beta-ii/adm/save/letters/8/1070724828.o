__Letter "uhm, don't get mad at me, but i did \"members\" and i noticed faust was still listed as an overlord.he no longer has his char here, so i created \"faust\", went to the guild hall... i promoted myself to sadist..(i demoted myself, don't worry)uhm.. i was just trying to figure out if since he is still listed as an overlord, if that will mean he still has all hisprivaleges.. and indeed he does, which creates sort of a.. security hole for darksouls.  please remove him as an overlord, or ask him to remake his char, i'm gonna leave it for now, you may log in to it yourself. the password is hohohoho.sorry, i just don't want other people getting in and fucking shit up.-jen"
