__Letter "Well, I broke down and went into paintshop and tried to paste together your proof, the problem is your 3rd proof is missing vital information of where it is to be placed.  If it went at the bottom of the previous two pages then it is missing 14 lines of the last 25 hm lines.  If it went at the top of the previous two pages, then there are stuff added to the last page that doesn't exist in the first page.  You do see my dilema in this matter.I am happy that you want to help out in this matter, and if this problem shall rise again, I would very much appriciate that you have over-lapping shots so there is no question of the offense, and would be better qualified to back up your defense.I am only an immortal as to which daboura is my boss, I did bring it to his attention, and although smite \"may have\" gotten away with it this time, we would more the wiser the next time he tries it.  I need to point out, we are only human, and we will make mistakes.Hepualahaole"
