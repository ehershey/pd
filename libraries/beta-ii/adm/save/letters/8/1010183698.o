__Letter "Whit,Here are two guild ideas I had.  I better win the contest.Name: The UnholyDescription: The organized collective force of all unholy and evil peoplewho wish to join, the Unholy are a formidable force bent ontipping the balance in evil's favor.  The unholy worship thegod Asmodeus and paying tribute to another is considered a great sin among their ranks.  It is said that the founder ofthe Unholy is the reincarnation of a demon from the past.  They are also incredibly loyal to the demons.-------------------------------------------------------------Other idea...-------------------------------------------------------------Name:The FatesDescription:The fates, understanding a great deal of the history of thegods, are a very exclusive group.  They use their knowledge to shape the future of the world and only add people to their ranks that are potentially useful in this.  To becomeone, you must be chosen.  Asking to become a fate is futile.It is said that the location of the fates' guild is not ofthis world.             Your Favorite Player,                           Leviathas."
