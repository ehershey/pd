__Letter "I just finished talking with spade, and his brother plague. Someone spammed their ip and, and i know plague has caused a a few problems, and if it was his fault i understand that part. But Dab has banned BOTH of them, saying something along the lines of both are banned since he doesn't know which is which and can't tell. I can't see how that is fair to spade if it was plagues fault. Just thought id throw my opinion out there. thanks for taking the time to read thisresolution"
