__Letter "I reveled in your revelry of battle. :) I have no qualms with youwishing to be the best you can. That's my goal as well and I amsure it's achievable with you by my side. Whatever I do, I wouldwant it to be with you. Grow strong with you, grow old with you,just be yours and love you right. Anyhow, I think I'm ramblingand if so, excuse me. I shall ever by there for you.Love,Uza"
