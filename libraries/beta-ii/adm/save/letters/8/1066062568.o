__Letter "How was your weekend?  You get that training all done with and everything?  I was hanging out with heath all day yesterday, so I wasnt around much.  He broke up with his girlfriend because she said he cared too much.  He was a bit upset about that, but we talked about it, and I think he's feeling a little better about it now.  I also wanted to thank you for taking the time to talk to me for a few minutes on saturday.  It really brightened my day.  *smooch*                 -Paul"
