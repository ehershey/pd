__Letter "ok, i doubt your even gonna read this, or read a little bit and just delete it, but i feel like saying it anyway, even though i know you have heard it before, and im not trying to complain or irritate you by it.why is it pyromancers dont get gate at 34? if at all, they should get it BEFORE the other mages, they should be the ones getting more conjuring, seeing is how EVERY SINGLE attack spell they have to conjure fire out of nothing to use, whereas sorcerors dont conjure anything for virtually any of their attacks, same with wizard, and necromancer.i just feel that we pyromancers should get it at 34, there is no reason why they should get it later than everybody else"
