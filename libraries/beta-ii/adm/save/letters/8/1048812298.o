__Letter "It's ok, it was mainly because i wasn't expecting it from him, even though we had our difference of opinions, i just took it as that and moved on, and actually started to respect him, i guess he doesn't have the maturity to do that. I actually feel sorry for him, paranoia is a scary thing i guess, and nothing has really happened to my character, she's lost all the junk she use to carry, there were some sentimental things in that, i'm still 2 diamonds down, Faust and Sugarcandy gave me one of theirs, but i can buy more, i have my special rings back and just have to regain a level.  I'm really not sure what the cleric in Lodos is suppose to do, but Faust rezzed me and i lost levels but not stats i don't think.Hermes was really good, he's pretty much the only reason i came back.  You and the other Admins and Imm's work really hard, and i really appreciate that, even though i do whine about dragons sometimes.  When Hermes was trying to calm me down, i came up with a wonderful idea for a pk island.  An area of about 50 rooms, thought there are only 5 actual visable mobs, each with massive Con but only worth 5 experience points, the mobs never repop in the same room, there would be another 5 hidden mobs they would have to search for but they would never be in the same place either and 2 wandering mobs that autoed.  There would be no oils or stones, no halls to improve and to get off the island you would have to make 100 mil (not sure if that is enough) and when you get off the island you lose it, it should be a punishment island, not a wooohoo now i have all this xp to myself island and get mega buff so i can do it again.Pk is never fair, i know that, but not even having the chance to move and the fact that even after the Skull in the death scene i was spammed numerous times with that message before finally getting down to -3000+, that is what i find really strange.Thanks again Stormy, it was really amazing how quiet it was without pk, and now it solves everythingWisp"
