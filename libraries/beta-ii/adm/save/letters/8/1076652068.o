__Letter "Ive added the command <loadup>.  It works decently for now.  There are still a few bugs, but what it does is loadups up an offline player and makes them linkdead.  Its not made for fun, but if you need to see something about an offline player, its possible.  If you do loadup a player, I suggest you use <call [player];remove_living> so it doesnt save the changes that you do to the player.  I still need to test it more, but your welcome to try it with test characters.Whit"
