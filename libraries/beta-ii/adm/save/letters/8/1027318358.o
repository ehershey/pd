__Letter "When you enter the master bedroom, if you close the door... you get an error message, and you can't lock or close the door again after that. It's like the door halfway doesn't exist until you try and open it. Now, on to colors!In the master bedroom - Make \"fantasy\" alternate in light to regular blues.make \"candles\" alternate yellow and bold yellow.Make \"shadows\" all grey.Make the master bedroom description read as follows...\"As You enter, an aura of fantasy seeps deeply into your very soul. The room is lit by hundreds and hundreds of long, un-dieing candles that cause shadows to dance over the large canopy bed, red-oak cabnit, and a tall floor mirror. The serinity makes goosebumps rise all over your body.\"Make any mention of \"Red\" in the master bedroom the dark-red color.In the description of the mirror, make \"magic\" multi-colored, and \"aura\" a light blue. Make \"Love\" bold, bright red.In the description of the bed, make \"white\" bold white. And make the description read...\"Dark red oak spires seem to stretch to the sky above the spansive head and foot boards. Pooling white silk flows like waterfalls down from the mystical canopy, pulled back at the moment by black silk ropes.\"~ON second though... make the white simply bold... and make the \"black\" whatever color is closest to black... like grey or whatever.In the decription of the cabinit, make red like I mentioned before, as with all the things in the room, and \"golden\" the bold yellow color. And \"Love\" a bright red. (Note that bright red isn't like the \"red oak\" color. Love is bright red, \"red\" is a dark red, as used in fire gauntlets.OK, and last little things... make the lines around the heart etching on the door bright red, or if it's possible, make it just like rejiks valentines, only keep my inscription on it. That would be real cool. Oh, and space the \"~\" away from \"Dedicated forever. MMSS\" on the picture on the wall on the bottom floor. Last but not least... spice up the living room by making the \"elves\" word all bold green, make a description for the cards on the table reading \"An un-openned deck of playing cards\". (Is that how you spell unoppened? Check that for me if possible. Anyways, that should be all. Thank you man.Cookie"
