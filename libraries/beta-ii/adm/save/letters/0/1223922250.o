__Letter "Dearest Husband, I have been away on many journey's, I will be back soon, to return to your arms, awaiting my warmth. Love, as you know, I have been away to many different realms. Mountainous landscapes, dotted with bottomless clear lakes, where the sun just kisses the waves. I wish you could have been along with me, but these were trips I had to take alone, to complete my state of Highness.  kill monsterkill monster 2kill monster 3kill monster 4I am finding my talents have grown, and I am becoming stronger in this life. Hopefully, in time strong enough to venture out with you, Love.  ~Empyean"
