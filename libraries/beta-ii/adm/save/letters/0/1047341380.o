__Letter "I was wondering if i could put this code im my workroom:int home() {if(this_player()->query_name()!=\"pyro\" && \"azuriel\")  {write(\"How did you get in here? You must get authorization from Pyro to get in here. For the time being, GET OUT!\");     this_player()->move(\"/wizards/\"+ this_player()->query_name() +\"/workroom.c\");}    else {if(this_player()->query_name()!=\"pyro\") { write(\"Welcome to pyro's workroom, you have been authorized. Enjoy your stay.\");    }   elsewrite(\"Welcome home pyro!\");}}If not, i was wonding if i could put it in another room.If not, i would wlike a detailed explanation why not, as when i would like to not be bothered, moved to someone, or talked to, i would like a retret, also, if the explanation does not make sense, or seems stupid, like \"because i said so\", i may have to do otherwise, like appeal to another."
