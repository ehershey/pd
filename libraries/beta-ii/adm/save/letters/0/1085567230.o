__Letter "Draft of Dragon Quest.An event would start this quest. Illithid Dragon slavers come to the mud, working on behalf of Asmodeus, setting up a small camp to the east and taking prisoner all weak dragons (I was thinking under level 30). Said dragons are instantly gone from the MUD, although their characters can be seen in various cages about the dragon slavers camp. However- it would appear the dragons have also taken three very valuble prizes as well... Azire, Venenum and Hepualahaole! Said immortals shall actually be on the rooms, chained with magical chains. The event is to free the three main dragons, who can be set all set free once the magical power behind the three half-demon-half-illithid ringleaders is broken. Once the three ringleaders are dead, most of the NPC slavers take their remaining prizes and teleport out, leaving a skeleton crew of mobs behind to remain as an outpost should they ever return. The players however cannot be saved. This cuts down or removes the problem of people having 'stored' alts- old dragons createdback when the quest was leaked something chronic and just leaving them at low levels, waiting for upgrades. It also provides a nice plot device for the background of the new dragon quest.The quest itself begins with the deed to get the endless torch. Then, in the forest to the east of Tirun, if the torch is on, it is night, and past a certain point in the reboot the torch will reveal a passage into the ground for a few seconds. After the passage is closed it will be impossible to open again that reboot- it can be exited, but to do so means that the player cannot return back to the cave, even with the torch. The torch itself would require no editing- all this code can be done in the room. Alternatively, the code for the torch can be edited and not the room- but one has to be. This fine point can be decided later.The player will progress down a maze of tunnels, deep into the earth. Every so often will be glyphs recorded on the walls of the cavern- ASCII shapes. These would be randomly generated from a list. Right down the bottom of the cave will be a dragon nest with several green dragon eggs. Two have hatched, but one is still yet to- the two green hatchlings will explain (responding to caught player speach) that in order for their sibling to be born successfully their mother must be rescued from the hands of an insane dragonslaver so she can bathe the egg with her breath weapon and break the egg. One dragon will mention the name of their mother, 'Ki'tzziopeala the Compassionate' The slaver will be in a randomly generated part of the cavern, with the green mother dragon caught under ropes. The slaver will refuse to let the dragon go free, but when asked for the price of the dragon he responds that he would consider a mental duel- the player must answer a series of increasingly hard riddles and mathmatics questions, at the completion of which the slaver releases the mother, who thanks the player with a gift. If the player is a dragon, the gift is a wearable green jade bracelet which can summon 1-3 jade-stone elementals once a reboot to assist in combat. If the player is not a dragon, the gift is of one her scales. The riddles themselves will have to be kept track of by a daemon, which wouldn't store the information over reboot- so that one player cannot answer all but one of the questions and have another player answer the last, rather that the number of questions each player has answered will be stored.The scale bears a strange rune mark on the outside. It doesn't autoload, but when given to the magic store owner in the city he gives it back, telling the player he can sense draconic magic in the scale. The rune mark is random, depending on the rune marks in the cave- laying the scale at the appropriate rune opens a portal to an underground cavern under the mountians to the west of tirun. The cavern contains a large statue of every one of the type of dragon, along with an appropriate orb, all contained within a maze. A ruby stone is set into the chest of a shrine there- it may be removed. There is a clear and obvious portal in the room which leads out into the mountians somewhere. When all the orbs are laid at the base of the correct dragon, that statue comes to life and warns the player they are the guardians of dragon isle and will test his or her worth before being allowed to proceed. Placing the orb at the claws of the wrong dragon results in the quest being unable to be finished that reboot and the player kicked out of the chamber. The testing is accomplished by a series of spoken riddles and tests, with each dragon asking one question each. The player is rewarded with a scale from each dragon he or she successfully answers. Leaving with any of the orbs causes them to self-destruct, harming the player. When the player has all the scales from all the dragons, he or she may pass through the portal onto dragon isle.Dragon isle is a small isle with jungles, an occasional dragon footprint, nothing particularly special apart from an old sacrificial knife hidden in some rocks, a clay pit and a scroll of some description. The scroll, upon examination, appears to be a once-off spell used to animate golems and bring them to life. It is found on the body of a dead wizard, along with two potions of healing and a book of spells. The book of spells has a contents page of spells in it, each of which can be activated by typing in the correct command word- most are reasonably useless, but two spells are necessary here- enlarge and stone to flesh. The last page is a note- instructions how to build a golem, except that the last  The instructions read:The best way to construct a golem is to build the body in miniture and have the body enlarged magically.

They can be found scattered about the island in random places- under rocks, in the den of small animals, etc. When the pieces have been assembled they read:The best way to construct a golem is to build the body in miniture and have the body enlarged magically. Although this can cause problems if the body is not perfect, by now you should have mastered the art of creating a simple clay body. The details do not need to be exact initially, but you must 'shapeshift' the body into the desired form once enough clay has been assembled. Once the form is perfect, you must cast the 'stone to flesh' spell I have so thoughtfully researched. Once stone to flesh has been cast, the body must be grafted with a piece of the creature you wish it to resemble- then, simply cast 'animate' then hit it with a lightning spell ('zap' is included in the spell list) to start it's heart. The creature now resembles the form of the thing which was grafted into it in every way- but beware! Even a magnificant spellcaster like myself is baffled at this creature's behaviour. They often die only minutes after creation. The cause would, initially, appear to be a lack of a soul- the creature is not undead nor demonic so cannot survive without a soul. In an effort to counter this defect I crafted a sacrificial dagger which I used to steal the soul of an orc and place it within the body of my large humaniod golem. As gory as this sounds, it would appear that this works! The humanoid golem seemed in every way to act like an orc, as though his mind was transplated between the two bodies. Amazing!The player must craft the body, preform the steps described above. The dagger has a command 'thrust', which takes an argument. The argument is a monster or player not in combat with the wielder- the command initializes combat, paralyzes the player, stealing some of the target's MP and SP. However, another valid argument is 'me' or the player's name- at which point the player has their soul sucked out. They have a minute or two to 'thrust statue'- If they do not do this they die. If they do, they still die, but are transported to an ethereal void similar to the one in current dragon quest- players must overcome a series of physical difficulties and syntax problems to finally find the exit. The type of scale which was put into the clay dragon statue dictates which class of dragon the player becomes. -- Thoughts? Please- feedback is needed! :D If you have any suggestions let me know and I'll change it!"
