__Letter "Hey man. Hehe set yourself me and try and exp. Kataans suck balls right now.Vortex does low damage (something like 900) for a 3 round para. Its pretty useless. Maybe if it had only a 1 round para.But anyways... you think it would be possible to code a spell taht does damage every round for a certain number of rounds? Lemme know if you could code something like that cause it would be tight for kataans and necros and maybe some other classes"
