__Letter "ThanksI was working on an inheritable file for ointment, almost done with it, just need to add some bug catchers (don't have any \"if(!variable)\" checks in there), test the elite numbers, and a few other things, and it'll be ready. You can check them out if you want, /wizards/nesoo/test/oint_base.c is the inheritable file, /wizards/nesoo/test/oint_shop.c is code one would use to make their ointment.If you have any suggestions, let me know."
