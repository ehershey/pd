__Letter "ok Cortoth has not been on in over 2 months and yet he still has his guild... an to be honest i stop playing once they took the guild i prolly would still be around and playing more if i still had mine an i was only gone for a week... i payed the guild dues i did everything they wanted me to do... so it just seems to me they (stormbringer) had a problem with me because i won't take any of there shit and i can see why people leave this game now. he's only fair to people that brown nose up his ass all the time sorry i'm not going to do that but i'll can tell him where to stick things though.. i'm not mad at you hon don't think i am i'm still shity that they are not fair on here i'll talk to you later hon"
