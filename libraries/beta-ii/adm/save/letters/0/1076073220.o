__Letter "hey azira, when you get a chance, go to the tirun board in the bar (the only one i guess) and read post 84. Eios seems to have rigged up a clock on the board, and i think its your coded clock for the autosaving time, you know, so that the time comes up instead of 'autosaving.' ?we think he may have got it off david at the forsaken boys' lan, and i know its darn easy to code a clock (i think lac prolly did it not eios), but i'd wanna make sure if i was you. it looks very similar to yours.Carmen."
