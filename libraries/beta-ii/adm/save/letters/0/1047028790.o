__Letter "Abils we need:- Tame: Can tame up to 4 animals and lasts untill they die. Based of Nature and Charisma.- Camouflage: Makes the Ranger invis. Can only be done in forests. Level 30-35 abil.- Silentstep: When the Ranger is walking in a forest they cannot be seen walking around unless the other persons Perception is higher then the Rangers Perception. Level 40 abil.Upgrades we need:- Shoot: Damage needs to be upgraded serverially to make it actually useable.- Mudarmour: Although it is only mud protecting you since i've been level 25 mudarmour has only ever raised my AC by 1 and lasted for 2min. So I was thinking this. After every 100 Nature the armour it gives is raised by 1 and lasts about 20 seconds longer.- Brew: The healing potions we make only heal about 40hp.- Forage: It's bugged majorly and needs to be fixed. Also it would be good for when we forage for herbs to be able to forage for a certain type like: forage herbs <herb type:healing/poison/antidote>Well that's it if i can think of anything else i'll tell ya.  --Eios."
