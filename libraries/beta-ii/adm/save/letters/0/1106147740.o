__Letter "Good to hear from ya.  As far as things go here, I'm generally retired.  I do some server admin stuff but only hop on here to keep up with any news that might pertain to me.  There isnt really an easy way to get a list of existing dragons, so I can't really help you.  If I see you on while I'm checking news I'll give you a holler.                 -Paul"
