__Letter "I just wanted to write to you and tell you how much I miss u...I hope that this doesn't startle u?What I mean is that I miss you..all the time, when we xp and when we just talk. I was looking over the lastletter that you wrote to me, and I started to think about something, I don't want to leave this game....but,if I dont come on as often its not because I'm going to be intimidated by someone. I may not come on as oftenbecause of my work....and I have to focus on that...because I need money right now...everyone does right?I also need to focus on other things, but one of my priorities is you....and I just wanted you to know that. I domiss playing this game with you, but.....I also want to learn this game....I may never be an expert on this, butat least I know something...and I have you to be greatful for....for helping me with this and everyhing else.I just wanted u to know that hun.....Froggie:)"
