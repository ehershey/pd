__Letter "This small statue was lovingly hand carved from river stone by the dragon Venenum. It depicts a female dragon curled up in sleep, her muzzle resting on her front paws as she slumbers. It is incredibly well detailed, down to each individual scale on her back, reflecting the dedication and passion placed into such an item. It is warm to the touch and, strangely, soft."
