__Letter "Well, besnell was suicided by a player who had gotten your password, and said he knows you. I have re arrested besnell and I would like to know if you have given any of your passwords out to any person, or if you think any person might have been using besnell with or without your consent. Let me know and give me a time frame on when we can meet with stormbringer to settle this whole matter."
