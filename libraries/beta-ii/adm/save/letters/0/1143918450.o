__Letter "I see in your heartbeat on the signet itself that you have 'tp = query_worn();' immediately followed by 'tp_mhp = tp->query_max_hp();' This is going to cause problems, because tp very well could be 0 (or UNDEFINED) if the ring is not being worn, basically meaning it's trying to call a function from an object that doesn't exist. You need to have an 'if( !tp ) { return;}' immediately following that, or the shorthand version that we were using before, 'if( tp = query_worn() )'.And, as far as I can tell, the signet isn't using the function thing, so, couldn't tell ya what problems there may be with that."
