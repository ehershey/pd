__Letter "Pyro was arrested on Primal Darkness, first Wraith said that Pyrowas Cenn, now he says that Cenn hacked Pyro's character and changedthe password on his own.  There was never no proof that Cenn is Pyro, as Pyro has had the char for over 8 months.  I think it is a little quick of him to make this move.  Next, Slysar was removed on Builders.  The only line I got on Builders was Slysar <cre> jerks... This is what he told me on game though.Slys tells you:since they couldn't stop fucking with me, I suicided onbuilders. guess I\"ll code somewhere elseI just want you to look into this, and tell me what is going on."
