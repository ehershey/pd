__Letter "Anne...  I'm really very sorry.  Talking about my marrying Azire, she was on my mind, and I accidently typed her name instead of yours.  I feel really bad about it.  I wish there was something I could do to make it up to you.  I would understand if you didnt want to talk to me anymore...  Anne, I'm sorry.                        -Paul"
