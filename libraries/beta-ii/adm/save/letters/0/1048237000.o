__Letter "The removal of rhondale really helps a ton with balance for Exping. It allowed for people to make over 2x their normal rates there.The one other thing really needed for exp balance is a second level of exp cuts. At high levels players can flatten areas like tenebrae/merk/lodos/sewers ect. As a lvl 83 i can clear all the mid areas on the mud in about 10 minutes. Its pretty good exp even with the cut because the mobs die so fast. In fact its as much exp as i get from killing drows with none of the risk.What is needed is a second level of exp cuts starting at lvl 50. At lvl 50 a 25k mob shouldnt give 16.6k anymore. It shuold give about 8k. This will keep high level players out of mid areas and where they belong.Break down of areas for levelsbelow 37 you can kill anywhere without cuts on 25k mobs which are the majority37-50 Sewers lvl 3, start roston and temple. hermes's area, and helgrath plains. Lvl 50 (where most people stop) - Perfect lvl for Roston and temple. No cuts here. Also FF is killable along with Purgatory graveyard and cavernsLvl 51-75   Purgatory graveyard, lodos temple (up till lvl 55 no cuts), FF (perfect spot), CavernsLvl 75+   Drows (great exp zone)There is perfectly balanced areas on the mud for all types of classes. The problem is that little mobs can be killed extreemly fast at higher levels so players never leave mid areas. I recommend a 3/4 cut for mob's exp after certain levels. Here's the breakdownLvl 50 -   25k and under lose 3/4Lvl 60 - 30k and under lose 3/4Lvl 70 - 35k and under lose 50%err not 50% but 3/4lvl 80 - 40k and under lose 3/4lvl 90 - 50k and under lose 3/4And so on.This will finish off balance, and also serve to keep players in areas that are more suitable (and thus challenging and exciting) for their levels"
