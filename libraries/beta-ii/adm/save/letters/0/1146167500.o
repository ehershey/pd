__Letter "It may seem a bit biased, but on a game dealing with friends. Aren't most thoughts and affiliations biased? But, to wrap up all in all a long letter, to a short one. I would like to nominate Carina to be an Immortal. She's been working hard on areas, and all her guilds. She already helps all newbies and anyone else she can without bias. And funny enough, most people she helps, don't like her. But she still helps them. I think she would make a good Immortal for the players.Thanks for your time Whit my brothah!Cyan"
