__Letter "Love is a symbol of eternity.  It wipes out all sense of time, destroying all memory of a beginning and all fear of an end. Will you love me in December as you do in May,Will you love me in the good old fashioned way?When my hair has all turned gray,Will you kiss me then and say,That you love me in December as you do in May?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Love is being stupid together                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Love is like a friendship caught on fire.  In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering.  As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable."
