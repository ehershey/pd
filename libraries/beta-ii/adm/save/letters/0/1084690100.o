__Letter "um....i'm not sure what you wanted me to explain as to what happened, but yeah...if you're angry at me because i had a go at the admins, well, the reason things like the ethereal upgrade go in is because whit didn't check it, and instead of giving david the authority to check it for bugs and balance, it just went in. David even offered kumi to check it, but she said it was just to go in.then we had a conference with kumi, me david daos, djerr and kumi, except she asked that i not be allowed to say anything the entire time because i had no valid argument. so i made daos gag me for the duration because i know i have a tendancy to say things when i know i shouldn;t even though it is the right thing to say.anyway, maybe me giving up on this whole fiasco is not the right thing to do, but when kumi gets her way, as she always will, and everything is unbalanced because immortals who Are here all the time advise Admins what should be done, and then admins think the better and allow unbalanced and flawed updates in, this is what happens. Daboura was already complaining about who hackless the virtuoso blades were, and fair enough kumi has requested the virtuoso blades and blood knives be removed, but there is so much more than just those two items.but kumi thinks i have no valid argument to contribute, and daos took offence when i questioned the items and updates to the first ethereal updates, because he put them in, so i really have nothing further to say about guild problems. david and daos and whit are more than capable to handle it, and they are the people players trust anyway.hope thats what you wanted to know"
