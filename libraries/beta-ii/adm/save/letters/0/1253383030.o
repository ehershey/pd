__Letter "I saw on the board you guys are looking for more code help. I can help you out with areas, mudlib, and any other thing you feel needs updated. Me and Ironman studied under the same person before he immed here. I've worked on armour (ive managed to balance armour through config files using material, type, limbs, enchanments) and made it so it is possible to remove parts or armour and then reattach that piece using material that is similar to that piece. I am currently working on allowing players to make their own armour. I've worked on weapon balancing in the same way as armour.I've done area work and put in class commands on a delay system with damage balanced off of daemon.I've taken a MUD that has no limbs and intergrated another lib to make them have limbs...not hard but time draining.I've set up guilds, made special items for holidays ...like costumes for players over halloween. you can find me on shadowmudii.genesismuds.com 1030 and mail me there or mail me here.I do not like being restricted to only /domains. So if you do think I could help out I would need at least  /std/ access.I'm an easy going guy and if you want to ask Ironman whether or not I'm an ass just tell him \"Kataro\" is applying. I have no probs helping out.%^RED%^K"
