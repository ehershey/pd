__Letter "just was exploring your 3rd level (after answering the appropriate riddle).  i don't know what all killed vyce (i suspect it might have been the room of 3 with the banshee), but wanted to let you know that i can consistantly take on 2 of those at a time, and can occasionally take on the 3 at a time with cortoth right now (Lich, She Raknid, Werewolf), though run rather low on both sp and hp.  from arena, i was able to break even with vyce when he was approx level 85, just to give a equiv level my stats put me at.  hope that helps you with balancing higher levels."
