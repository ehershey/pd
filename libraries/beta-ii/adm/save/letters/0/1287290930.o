__Letter "Overall: looks good. Would recommend more room descs for roads and houses,it seemed like there was a lot of repetition there. Also recommend a few moremobs to populate the roads with, right now it seems like it's a city ofjust teenagers. Lastly, I don't know how else to say this, but this areais very.... gay. You describe a lot of men in detail (and as being \"toned\"),there aren't very many women around town (mostly cause all the teens andyoungsters are male), and the women are mostly not described in the samelevel of detail. I'm fine with that really, just wanted to let you knowthe impression I got. I liked the naked guys whistling at the naked girlson the beach too, very comical.Rooms:15 (a road):\"lamp post\" in long desc but item is \"lamppost\"107 (a house):look bookcase -> \"...has 5 shelves on it...\" this makes me think there is somesignificance here when there isn'tlook duster -> \"...Perhaps the maid was murdered...\" kind of comes out ofnowhere, also implies a quest/deed that doesn't seem to exist88 (docks):look dinghy -> \"... hasn't been sailed...\" s/sailed/used/, you don't sail arowboat101 (beach):look flags -> missing a . on the enddock:Should probably have a unique descriptionMobs:All mobs have too much gold - make it appropriate to what they would carrymore like 4+random(30) on teens, merchants can have even 25+random(200) thoughToo many mobs are warriorsnot much diff between 'youngsters' and 'teenagers', perhaps give teensa higher level, like 3+random(4)arlonyoungster3:arlonteenager3:would probably not make it known that he is \"training\" to become a rogue,also you need two daggers to use slicecityguard:\"The guard is a police officer... and it would not be wise to mess with them\"horse:use horsefixed.c (and saddlefixed.c) so horse and centaurs can wear the saddlezatrick:\"Cauldrons\" shouldn't be capitalizedarlonhusband:why is he wearing chainmail??should be a level difference between him and teenagersshoppers:should be higher level too, basically adults' levels > teens' levelsfloppingfish:should probably be a very low level... since it's not even in waterItems:diamondbracelet:ac == 0 or 1legwraps:ac == 1 or 2mageweaveshirt:nowhere is it described what 'mageweave' is...saddle:use saddlefixed instead, ac == 1silkshirt:\"...it is very fancing looking...\"sharpsword:\"...in a very unspecial way..\" gotta be a better way to say thatthornedspear:should probably make this two-handed since it has a special AND 3 WCthe weapon special is done wrong, see/d/freepk/merkkerri/mob/merkkirri/ivorydagger.c for an examplethe write() and say() in the special should say the same basic thing,not different things like it doeswoodenstaff:wc == 3 max"
