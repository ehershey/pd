__Letter "You know, it is funny, you only gripe about this once every week to two weeks. You are not around the rest of the time. The rest of the time you idle or are not even here. Hel, I do not even know if you are the same Seeker who started PD. That Seeker cided then you show up wanting access. You can gripe, complain, and whatever all you want, be glad you have imm access for now. I know nothing about you. I do not know who has access to your comp and character, what you plan on doing with the admin access, etc. I think if you are the real Seeker and want admin back you should be around a little more often than every 10 days or so and be an active part of the mud. After all that has gone on I have no trust in hardly anyone and I have every right to be that way. You quit, even when you came back you wanted nothing to do with PD and now after all this time you suddenly want admin access to a mud you hardly even know anymore. PD does not belong to you, me, or any one person. PD belongs to the players and the staff as a whole. Everyone here has earned their spot here. I know Seeker started this mud, I would not be here without that but that does not mean once you quit you can return nearly 2 years later to reclaim anything. You want to work on the mud, then work on the mud as you are, do what you can. You want to idle as game master go elswhere. I understand real life getting the upper hand and taking someone offline, if you would have returned a year ago with all this once you got back online I would have been fine with it. The mud and staff have moved on, things are much different and you have not been a part of anything in the past two years. You want to be a part now, you have to earn it.Stormy"
