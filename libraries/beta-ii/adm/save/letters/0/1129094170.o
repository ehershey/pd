__Letter "hey, ok to answer your question.  The way that I did my area is on Microsoft word I puts down a list of monsters, and a list of weapons and armour.  With the monsters I put how much each one was going to be worth and then I made a list with the weapons and armour that each mob was going to be getting.  Then I wrote the descriptions for each armour, weapon, and monster.  Then I coded all of the weapons and armour first.  The reason I did that, is b/c you have to move that item to the monster, so it needs to be coded before the monster.  Then I coded all the monsters with thier weapons and armour on them.  Now I am doing the rooms..and you move the monster into the room in which you want.That is the way I did it, I have been doing room descriptions as i go b/c it moves things fasterIf you need any clarifications or any help, I am here.Carina"
