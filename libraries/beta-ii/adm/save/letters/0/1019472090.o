__Letter "Hmmm, well you helped out making the guild so I guess I'll send this to you.At the moment I am writing some new guild rooms, but I am going to ask you to add them all at once later for ease. However, there is one room that members have been bugging me to get in soon - The locker room.I've got the description and other normal stuff down, but I don't know the locker code. So if you could add that bit (or tell me, whatever) and then move the file into normal PD, would be good.Hmmm, the exit has to be changed. Since it is just one room and one exit I didn't think it would need the header. That and the fact that I can't get the header to work for some reason.	- Aziraphale"
