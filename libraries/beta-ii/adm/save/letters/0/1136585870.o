__Letter "One ability that is worth thinking about possibly redoing is cloak.Permanetly being invisible to all players is a very very powerful ability and this is easily abused. No other class has anything that is permanant. Even temporary cloaks such as dance in the shadows or darkshift are very powerful.I used to have an elite assassin and cloak made PK very unbalanced. I would cloak and idle for hours and no one had the chance to know to avoid zones like merk/rhon. I suggest that cloak drain stamina every tick while used. Perhaps 15 sp per tick or something there abouts. That way it is still useable to be sure, but you cannot cloak and idle for hours at a time.Just my thoughts,-- Vyce"
