__Letter "Frozen breath exhaled as she walked the planehere she paced the goddess without nameapostles gathered at her dark cloak trailcorpses strewn around cold and paleand so begins the night of the damneda dark goddess rises offering deaths lich handmaybe some day we shall all be forgiventill that time she scorn our landtragic lies behind dark green eyesfutile tries all our lives wastedyet still we try to hide from ourselveswe are death rampant we're the tears you cry.hide from the shadows that flicker in your roomwhen the moon comes ill serenade your life awaythe living dead feel nothing, tears we never cry"
__Undeleted ({"scourge",})
