__Letter "Had a thought for a new spell.Am very happy with druid atm, love the support roll and aiding the partyThe only thing thats kinda got me going \"umm...\" Is that I am wating to do morefor the party while am in it. The buffs are great, but after that...well..thatsit. Am eliteand I have moprh but am really more intersted in the party side of things thensolo xping.As it is at elite there is no elite spell, but we getmoprh, which is very good,but not really helpful when it comes to partying.What I was thinking about was, Totems. They could be bought into play in theway a paladin makes his sword and once in the game you can only have one of any typeout at a  time.The druid could wield(or plant it down at the start of combat) and then whilefighing the druid could \"channel\" the totems power (kinda like plague.. i think).druid could \"channel\" the totems power (kinda like plague.. i think).This wouldnt put the druid in combat, but it also wouldnt allow the druid toperfom anything else wwhile channeling(again, i think like plague)The totmes could have many differnt effects, like...Lower mob(s) defense, slow mob(s) down, drain mob(s) mp or hp or sp.There could even be a totem(s) that slowly regenrate party hp or sp or mp.Or increase party attack speed, if its possable draw monster agro to the atotem so that it attacks the totem more then the party.The possablitys are endless. The only thing that I guess i would say is withtotems try and avoid the effects on players and buffs all ready do.I personly think this would be a great addition to the druids repertoire ofparty orientated spells.Whats ya thoughts?Bonnie.
