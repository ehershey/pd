__Letter ">Bubba died in a fire and his body was burned pretty>badly. The morgue needed someone to identify the body,>so they sent for his two best friends, Daryl and Gomer.>The three men had always done everything together.>>>Daryl arrived first, and when the mortician pulled back the>sheet, Daryl said, \"Yup, his face is burnt up pretty bad. You better>roll him over.\" The mortician rolled him over, and Daryl said, \"Nope,>ain't Bubba.\" The mortician thought that was rather strange.>>Then he brought Gomer in to identify the body. Gomer took>a look at the body and said, \"Yup, he's pretty well burnt up. Roll>him over.\" The mortician rolled him over and Gomer said, \"No,>it ain't Bubba.\" The mortician asked, \"How can you tell?\">>>Gomer said, \"Well, Bubba had two assholes.\">\"What? He had two assholes?!\" said the mortician.>Yup, everyone knew he had two assholes.>Every time we went to town, folks would say,>\"Here comes Bubba with them two assholes.\">>"
