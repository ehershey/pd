__Letter "i have been active i posted on my guild board where i was and what has been going on so i have no clue where you guys are saying i have been inactiveand plus if you just give away peoples guilds that were bought in an auction then they should have all there money given back because that is not fair and i even was paying dues up till amun told me i didn't have to pay them any more and that was just before i left for florida or a week and i haven't even been back from florida for a week so i know darn well i have not been inactive i was even on when your wife was on and i even said hello to her as well on the guild line not illuminati lineso i wasn't on for almost 24 hours that seems real fair. furiae"
