__Letter "Hi love, well i'll be moving my computer today and all my other stuff,so I am not sure when I'll be on.  I have to do it today, because I can'tdo it on the weekend.  Will come on as soon as I can and will miss you.I'll email you as soon as I'm online again.  If I can get a computer atsomeone else's place in the meantime, I'll do that.  The internet connection is there, but I'm not sure how long it takes toactivate it.Hugs,your Rayna"
