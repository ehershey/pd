__Letter "Swipe is kinda nuts. 3 hits kills a 28k mob for a lvl 35 dragon. Weimic fighters are even more nuts. i saw one do tenebrae at lvl 20 with base stats. 5 hits for a 25k at lvl 20 with no stats and low skills.Plus its a low sp cost move. pretty nuts.Cut is still strong for my gypsy too. he's very very fast"
