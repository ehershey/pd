__Letter "I tried to remort thief and it wouldn't let me so i figured maybe it was spelled theif. And well.... it was and now i'm a 'theif' with no thief skills or abils, cant enter the thief hall and so on. other than this, the remort system seems awesome :) but now i'm kinda trapped with all my crystal armor unless i ditch it on someone"
