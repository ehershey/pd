__Letter "Can you please explain the fact that heartbeats are perfered over call_outs to Carina. She stated to me that stormy and Hep said to use call_outs but i read the same as you taht call_outs lag the mud. Now i understand why.  Mappings run slower then arrays anyways, take up more processor time.I tried to explain to her that coding call_outs into a room file and then inheriting it god only knows how many times into dozens or hundreds of rooms would just be....... ugly.... I'm going to wire something of my own design to perform what she and Hep were striving for anyways. So i hope that will solve the issue. Only thing i am concerned with is IF Hep and Sotrmy did tell her that then they need to be explained the differances in call_outs and heart_beats.Ironman"
