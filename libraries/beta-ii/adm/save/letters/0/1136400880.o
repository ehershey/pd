__Letter "Basically. I wouldn't want any of the wizard folders, nor most of the /d/ stuff (just Tirun and the wizlounge area, kinda like the builder port). I have a spare PC laying here that I plan on putting Linux on.I wouldn't even connect the thing to the net so I don't have to worry about anyone somehow finding it and connecting, hehe.It would allow me to more easily look at files and see how things work, and make changes to them without fucking up one of the ports we have running here, and maybe bring some of those changes over.Again, thanks for the help."
