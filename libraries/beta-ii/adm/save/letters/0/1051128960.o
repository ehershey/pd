__Letter "I have chosen to retire for some time now.  I wish my character to remain because I will be able to come online sometimes of a weekend.My moms fiancee, my future step dad, committed suicide on sunday (easter).  I just now got to a computer.  I wanted to tell you guys the reason why this came up.Whit."
