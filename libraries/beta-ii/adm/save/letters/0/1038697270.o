__Letter "Ummmm bubba, what happened to your telling the guilds that we could not have a transporting ring back to our guild halls.....and then I find out that you let the forsaken have one when you originally told me No on that subject while I was leading darksouls.If you have the time, id like an explaniation, this is like the second or third time that ive seen something happen in the game that you told one player \"No that will not happen in my game\" and then you let another player either do it or have it. Come on man, if you are going to decide something then stick with it and dont gyp players like that.Im sorry if im going off on a rant, but something like that really gets under my skin."
