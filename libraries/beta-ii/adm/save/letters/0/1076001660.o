__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Wraith to Whit Wed Feb  4 19:26:24 2004:-----hey, the guild in purgatory needs to be removed. One of the conditions of purg was that you HAD to go through the forest to get to it. Can you please remove the forsakens guild in purg? They can have the guild in there, but no portal to get to it. No portals were to be allowed. Sorry bud, I'll refund their money myself if I have to."
