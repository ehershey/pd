__Letter "i noticed that you are cracking down on rule breakers and stuff :) this is good and all, i really don't like cheating. but anyway, to get on with things, Helana and I (Tsuke) play over a LAN, is there a way that we can prove that we are on a LAN and that it isn't just me multi-playing? i mean, i use the apply command when i remember, and i have helena's and my name on there, and we use seperate computers and everything, but according to what you've said, i can't help her by giving her money (for oils, etc.). so presumeably, this also means that i can't give her a mheal if she needs it or anything for that matter (and visa versa).I'm not asking to be exempt from the rules, no-one deserves exemption, I am just wondering to what extent may i interact with helena over the MUD. If it can be undeniably proven that we are using a LAN setup, can we interact? The reason i am asking all this is because i don't want Helena or myself to be dested. we have both put a fair amount of time into our characters and to see it all taken away because some-one thought we were multi-playing, when we aren't, would be hard to take.Thank you for your time.       - Templar Tsuke."
