__Letter "Pk will be opening within the next reboot, not the reboot on March 24, but the next one.The uid thing I do not really see a problem with, I have scoured the mud looking for any problems from it and have found none unless the tell problem and follow problem are caused by the uid.Speaking of the tell problem, I will forward you an email from wisp about a problem she is having from tells, please look into it and see if you can find anything, I looked and saw nothing.Also, follow is kindof bugged, sometimes it will dump a follower for no reason, it could be a uid problem, it does happne in tirun, but it also happens in lodos, tene, etc and those areas did not change uid so I think it might be something else.If you would, when you have time, look into these things.I finally found a job so I will not be on during the mornings much during the week. I work part time, so I will be on after lunch. I am also working on getting my comp graphics skills honed so though I may be idle on the mud, you should be able to reach me on msn or aim or whatever. Let me know if you need anything mudwise or irl wise, I will be happy to help out.Stormy"
