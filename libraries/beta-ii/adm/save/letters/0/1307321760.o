__Letter "Hey Nul. Quick balance suggestion:On any char that can wield a knife or sword by far the best items in the game are dark knife and dark blades. Unbelievably better than anything else. With the blades in particular you never have to heal because of the amount of life their specials give. On my rogue i get sp back twice as fast because i use idle rounds while using ointments. Frankly it's too much sp and too much hp for often they special. No other weapons even come close. I'm sure you'll think of a good way to balance them, but if it was me I would remove their specials entirely. Let some of the harder to get swords like dragonsfury give a little bit of sp or hp (not both) once every 20 hits or something. No need for easy to get items like dark blade to be so insane.Cheers-- Ozzy"
