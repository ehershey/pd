__Letter "Get Off your high horse Nightshade.Now that i have your attention, i wish to talk to you about a couple of things, both envolving harrassemnt. Firstly i wish to bring to your attention that Helena was once again harrassed, this time by Seth (Eios' alt) but has also been previously harrassed by Galdur (She was told to \"get over it\" by you (Nightshade) i believe), the point is, she takes harrassment seriously, and on each occasion she has been brought to tears by these players. She has been told to use the harass log, this is all well and good, but is she usually in tears and dosn't remember to log it. what other solution is there? perhaps she should just turn it on when she logs on and log everything, but that's no good because you won't want to go through 100000 lines of nothing on the chance that she may have been harassed while she is on. Use the ignore command, this is all well and good, but emotes can still be seen, and it is usually the emotes that upset her the most. what is left? not playing. that is it. which is not a good option, because except for a couple of people, helena really enjoys this game.now, what are you going to do nightshade? the answer is probably nothing, why? i'm not sure, your _First_ rule in the rules (\"help rules\") is \"You may not harass anyone. If they ask you to stop, just apologize and be nice. This is supposed to be a fun experience. There is a harass log. The punishment for harassment varies but is never taken lightly.\" It would seem from your last response that you do infact take harassment lightly. this is unfortunate as it allows people like galdur and eios to get away with just about anything they want.I know that by sending you this mail i am in danger of being dested, but what the hell, I don't particualrly want to be apart of a mud that upsets my girlfriend nearly every time we log on, we play to have \"fun\" tell me nightshade, where is the fun in being reduced to tears, or being made so angry that you want to kill something. i'll tell you, there isn't any fun in it. i personally hate the feeling.If your still reading this, then thank you for at least hearing me out. I apologise for any grammar or spelling error that may have given you a headache.     - Templar Tsuke the Honeycomb Lord."
