__Letter "Hey love, I was stuck in a dorm tonight and unable to get away until late. I wish you got to bed a little earlier as rest isgood for you. :) The easy half of the night is done. Now comesthe stay awake challenge! I found out 4 of my guys are gonnaget written up for congregating for 2 hrs on camera instead ofproperly doing their jobs. My work will be cut out for me thistime. I am not looking forward to it. Tomorrow, I will probablybe in the office for an hour at least handling all these write-upsunless they do them en masse as one big thingee. (<-- technical term)No matter what, though, I will try my best. I miss you, not a surprise, right? :) And I know I will see you soon. Gonna leave nowas Rogre on SM is killing mosuitoes every pop and raking inscads of xp, muhuhahaha! in his dragonscale armour! I hope you sleep well. I will be thinking about you and be very happydoing so. :) But not -that- happy, I have some dignity! LOL.Take care of my Rayna as she is very special ta me, k? :)Love,James"
