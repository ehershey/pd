__Letter "Ok well here goes. When I first started xping  my bladedance (which does weak dmg on a full hit) was averaging 0-1 extra hits. Now it got a little better later on but to me, a lvl 37 swashie with max blade, 80 str and 90 dex...this shouldnt be. There should be a minumun as well as a maximun to the move. I've worked hard on this char and have nothing to show for it. Now thats not to say i dont still like the class but with this lvl and 350+stats a lvl 19 rogue with 30 and who didnt get a bs off beat me in the arena, its just not right ven. I agree that i should be as buff as a fighter to start, but if I work at it(which I have) then my str should equal that work. :PNow on to my other idea. Trip, a neato move but I think it needs a little tweaking. Maybe it can parra one rouynd and knock them down so they cant special or anything while 'tripped'. Also maybe at higher levels and higher Dex it can do more, like a chance for a 2 round parra before they can stand up? I dunno just asking. Well tats it thanks for listening.Davyn."
