__Letter "I've been messing around with bear form against various players and mobs and here are a few changes I think that need to be implimented1. Swipe is almost worthless as it stands. You need to buff it up as it does about as much as jab would.2. Make it so you max out attack when you turn bear and your melee raises based on nature.  Why, you might ask?  Simple.  Like I said, in the forties it costs around 2 million to raise attack up by one.  And since Druids are a spell casting class, we use our spells pretty much alone. Thusly, no one will spent what is most likely to be around 600 million xp to max out attack at level 50.  However, melee is a bit more reasonable.costWoops, heh3. Since we go druid, wouldn't it be safe to assume we would sacrifice intelligence/wisdom for strength/dexterity?  Bears are hella strong, and hella fast, so I would assume we give up spell protection for that extra strengthIt still needs to be worked on a bitI beat Hep, but Scarface wailed on me badly and he's a level 30 something gypsy.In any case, get back to me man.  Let's see what we can work out, eh?"
