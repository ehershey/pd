__Letter "Great idea, yet it is a little easy to work around. A suggestion perhaps is to extend all command lengths to 2 or for some even 3 rounds. And to make it so more skill is needed, put in a starting message, for example if I go to stab, a message appears such as \"Resolution grips his knives tightly\" or some such. By learning the messages you can learn what length they are, and how to counter them. Also putting in more gimping commands, or commands to hinder your opponent, and aid you would make it harder. Commands to dirt your opponent or some such, making it so they have a harder time seeing you, and reacting to your attack perhaps? Also elemental effects, if a mage has a ice shield up, they take less damage from ice based spells and weapons. just an idea"
