__Letter "Hey love, I have completed day one of my vacation. :) I am sounbelievably tired but I wanted to tell you about my day. :) Wehad a good drive for 9 hours or s. Russ drove 1st like a bat outof heck. :) Then Myra dove pretty fast. I took little naps hereand there. We were well received and they said they missed usgreatly. I need to get some sleep soon. :( I plan on popping on here and there nights to try to see you. I hope things are goingwell and I also have some Josh-relatede news if you choose to hearit. But, baturally, you can choose not to. :) Maybe I see you tomorrow? :) I love you immensely, lady. :)Love,JamesP.S. - On the way here, I saw a sign for Xenia, Ohio. How cool isthat? :)"
