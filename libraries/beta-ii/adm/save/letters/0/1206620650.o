__Letter "The number one thing to me is you feeling better. So, my ferventwish, (using a $5 word here. :)) is for you to feel better, wellrested and of course, in less discomfort. So, I can wait, believeyou me. :) And wait, I shall, for you are worth it, as I haveenumerated before (see, I coulda just said said!) :) I am workingon a paper I was supposed to hand in 2 days ago. Yes, I was bad.But now, I gotta pour my heart into it and try to impress theteacher to counteract any drop in grade I woulda had normally!Sleep will come when it comes. Until then, I will be burningthe noon-night (would be midnight if I werent a vampire, hss!) oil.Feel free to say hi if ya see me. Dunno how long I be up. Feelbetter, have some fun, laugh a lot and just be you. :) You arealways in my prayers. :)Loooooooooove with many o's,James"
