__Letter "Hi, it was nice talking to you again. Sorry for dumping on you, just seemsso much weight to carry.  I guess that's what grief does to a person.I do miss James, and I know now that I was being unfair to both of us,because I should have gotten over the past situations before I starteda new one. I guess I'll let time heal and take it one day at a time. HugsRayna"
