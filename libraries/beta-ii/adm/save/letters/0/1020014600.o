__Letter "I know you got irl things going on, so I won't even talk about how often you are logged on. I will however tell you, you need to work on your area and guilds while you are here. Nothing else. Do not worry about quests, commands, bugs, typos, or anything else. You were hired to do duilds and do your area, I allowed you to stay with good faith you would finish your area. It hase been four months and you are no further with finishing your area than when we opened that I can tell. Do not start anything new until it is done. This is very important to me, it is a contract between you and I and you have not completed it. Until it is complete you are under review and if work is not shown within a reasonable amount of time, you will be demoted. I like you guy, you learn fast and have good ideas, but you need to finish what you started, you need to work out the bugs that are still plaguing the guild system, and you need to get it done soon.Stormy"
