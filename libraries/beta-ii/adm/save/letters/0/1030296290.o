__Letter "I shouldn't freakin' have to spend hours doing nothing but exping so that I don't have to worry about people wasting my time.Time == Time.  That should make sense even to Faust.  Any time lost on either side of the equation should not be made up with time on the other.  It doesn't matter if your exping to get stronger, or dying and losing weeks of exp; you're just wasting time, one is just more constructive than the other.  If I don't want to exp and say, roleplay, I shouldn't have to exp to stay where I am. "
