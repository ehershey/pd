__Letter "I wasnt going to suicide OrhcaIt was a comment. If some one told you I was going tosuicide my char they were causeing shit.I'll undestand if you are pissed off at me for what I did onthat Gor thing, but I didnt know that Sending some one anIM would cause so much trouble.I tryed to explain that I was new and that only caused more trouble.I was told that i shouldnt be on there if i didnt know what iwas doing and that I should leave untill i have learnt how to act on the thing.Am pretty cut up at the moment because I think that I have upset you and dissapointed you.I want to say that am sorry, and that i hopei havent made things hard for you on there.Orcha."
