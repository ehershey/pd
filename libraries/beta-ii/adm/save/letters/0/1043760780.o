__Letter "About what turns me on and stuff, i really don't know anymore, being pleasing turns me on, knowing i'm turning someone on turns me on, different things at different times of the month turns me on.  My arousel comes more so from the person i'm with, if what they are doing to me is arousing them, generally i'm pretty aroused myself. i really haven't been all that sexual during the past few months.  Joshua has taught me a lot about myself and D/s, it's not all about sex.  Some of the best times have been just smooching and cuddling, in fact i crave that but it's been taken from me until i can prove myself.  He knows i'm a good slave, he knows others think i'm a good slave and wish to take me off his hands"
