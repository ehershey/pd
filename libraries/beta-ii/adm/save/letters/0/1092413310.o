__Letter "we (the immortals and nightshade) met last night and talked it out. Basically - NS told ven and helena to drop it and not bring this crap to the mud anymore. That night, i received an MSN message from Helena asking to talk. I told her to leave me alone, that I wanted to be alone. Not to talk to me. I get online today and there is this:Letter 242:Fri Aug 13 10:53:46 2004 from VenenumTo: Tsuke Azire Subject: Re; StuffTsuke, read the following in their entirety.http://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/niceguys.shtmlhttp://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/datejerk.shtmlhttp://seattlepi.nwsource.com/lifestyle/68913_niceguy03.shtmlhttp://www.nomoremrniceguy.com/ngs.phphttp://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/predicate.shtmlhttp://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/realniceguys.shtmlThese describe the person I am and the opposite of the person I want to be. Ido not want to be a whiny, winging, clingy, self serving slime. You come to me saying you willbreak off your friendship with me if I cease being the Nice Guy. All I can say is, if youwould condemn me to this life of misery and servitude, then you are not my friend.You can deal with that or you can leave my life and not come back.-------which comes in response to this: --------Fri Aug 13 03:12:06 2004 from TsukeTo: Azire Subject: Read Me PleaseHi, I am sending the mail as I would like to get a message across to the bothof you. After you have read it, then you can take whatever action you deemnessercary, in terms of the game, or real life.Firstly I would like to say Grow Up to the both of you. You are both behavinglike 16 year old (Or perhaps younger) spoilt brats.Secondly I would like to add some points directed at Venenum. David, you needto stop thinking with your dick. You have got a possibly bright future in frontof you, but only if you start using you head. Also, if you wish to become abastard, cunt, arsehole, whatever; then fine, it's your life, thats yourdecision, but consider this, if you wish to pursue this line, then consider ourfriendship ended. I Will Not Associate myself with those types of people, asthey only get themselves and the ones around them into trouble.Thirdly I would like to direct some points to Azire. You, as mentioned before,need to grow up as well. Yes you have problems in your life, who dosn't. Butyour problems are NOTHING compared to some of the things david has gone throughin his life. If You really wanted to end this, then you should have acted likean adult and fixed it yourself and not brought someone who had NOTHING TO DOWITH THE SITUATION into it. Are David and Carmen so hard to talk to now? Are wenot allowed to act as good friends should and stand up for David? I think youneed to have a good long hard look at yourself and your actions Azire, and howit affects the others around you, Ones Who Cared about you.Lastly, as I am guessing about what will come of this mail, If Either of youhave any problems, or want to discuss this mail, then come and talk to me.These are My Words, My Opinion.  -- Dane Thomas. Severing more friendships.----------- i mailed it all to NS.. after i had a 'talk' with venenum. Basically he sent me tells telling me to goto him to talk to him. I didn't want to, but finally aquiesced. He said he wanted to 'thank me for helping him realize the problem' as you can guess by now, this was a set up. He went on to further expound on those websites, and barf up what he read on them. I told him that I didn't care anymore, and that if he felt that way, he needed to get up, get out , and work on himself. I told him I was done - not to bother me anymore. He sent me more tells after I went home. I told him to stop talking to me.So."
