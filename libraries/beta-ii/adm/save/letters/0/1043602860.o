__Letter "Your area needs alot of work, Alot of the rooms have sentances that need to be capitalized, alot of the room descriptions are not usable, such as the bar. You need to describe what is there, not what has transpired there: The bartender was killed and the centaurs were unable to find anyone else, so it was closed down. This is not acceptable to the quality we want from our areas. Alot of the landmarks you chose to use are no availible in the forest where the village of centaures is going, such as the mountain. It needs a bit of work before I can put it in. Please go through and read through the room descriptions and decide how better to describe the things in the room. It is a good first draft, just needs some finishing work.Stormy"
