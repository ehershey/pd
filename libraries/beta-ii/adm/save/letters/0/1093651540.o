__Letter "Raknids deal far too much dmg for them to be fair, especially for zerkers.My solution would be to make there limbs take a LOT more dmg then other races.This would force them to have to stop, and mend thier limbs, or face them falling off mid combat.This would help slow down the large raknids, and the small ones."
