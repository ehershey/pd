__Letter "Ok...I pitched this idea over the Hm line while i was active earlier...and i was told to mail you...Ok..so i was flying around, and i was getting the feeling that...'Gee...this map does help...but its so small...'And...then i got to thinking...\"It'd be awesome if the map size was customizable...If we could set it at 20x20, or 15x15...Or even keep it at a standard 9x9 too!'See...my reasoning on this is...Well...seeing 4 rooms in each direction, while it does help a little...It really doesnt help much to determine your position.  And i just think that if you could set the map size up to say a max of 25x25, it'd create a much greater 'Ease of Use' feature to it.  I know i personally would LOVE if it was custimizable...Or even just pre-set larger at or around 20x20.anyway...any questions about what the hell im blitherin on about...send me a tell if ye see im active, or pester Daos to ping me over msn or something to get me on here.  Danke"
