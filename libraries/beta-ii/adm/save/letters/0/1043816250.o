__Letter "01/28/03I want to begin by thanking both of you for yoursupport and help last night.  Knowing how I am.. andhow I react to shit.. that would have gotten reallyugly really fast.  I realise last night just howamasingly awesome it is to have someone you trustoutside of the situation to, if nothing else, givesupport and advice.  I was reading over one of thesites (I can't remember which it was) and I waslooking through some of the various details of thislifestyle.  Some of them I know I could enjoy, whileothers.. well no.  I think I want to try and stay asfar away from the masochistic style of submission as Ican for the time being.  I'm not a very um.. I don'tknow the word for it.. but I know I more then likelycouldn't stop someone from doing something I don'twant.  Everything that has happened keeps running through myhead and everytime I think about it, I smile becauseI'm so lucky to have found people like you.  It's niceknowing that I can talk to Wisp and find out I'm notjust crazy and it's ok to be happy about the thingsthat make me happy.  It's like.. exploring a newarea.. and being so damn afraid you're going to dosomething wrong.. or say the wrong thing.. and thenfinding out.. that what you're feeling.. and what youwant to say.. isn't wrong at all.  I don't know how todescribe it.. I think my mind's too hectic.One thing I have noticed in myself in the past twodays is that I have more confidence.  I think that thepossibility of me being prized, loved, cherished, anddesired by someone is beginning to complete what I'vebeen missing in myself.  It's like.. even if I don'thave someone right now.. the fact that someday.. I'llbe able to make that one person.. so happy.. to beable to give them all of me.. it makes me almost giddyinside.  It's odd.. I keep feeling like.. I don'tknow.. I think I still have some sort of fear.. thatI'm going to screw something up.  I can't trust myselfto not mess this up.. and that scares me.. I've beenhappier in the past two days.. then I've been in thepast year.. I don't want to lose that.  Today has beenthe worst day.. the kind that would normally havecrushed my mind and my emotions to pieces and some howI still feel whole.. I called Hadley (big mistake Iknow) and things that he said.. I realized.. he wantedme to feel like complete shit.. and it almost worked. Then I remembered Wisp telling me \"YOU ARE NOT ADOORMAT\" and I had the power to hang up.. I normallywould have been crushed.. called him back.. apologizedfor something I didn't do and play to his ego a bitmore.. for some reason.. I didn't need to do that thistime.  I guess all those sites about finding the rightmaster.. and how being a submissive to someone is agift just clicked.  My love was a gift to him.. i waswilling to do anything he asked.. and he never eventried to love me.. I guess I know now that if I wantto serve someone like that.. I have to find a personresponsible enough to be able to handle it.  *shrugs*my thoughts are so jumbled right now.. part of whatwas said last night.. still stings.. guess I can'tignore it.. I almost feel like shit for not seeing itcoming.. Oh well.. this isn't a bitch session.. sorryit turned into that..Yours,Heather"
