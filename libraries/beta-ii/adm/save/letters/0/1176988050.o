__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Uzamaki to Rohl Wed Apr 18 19:59:32 2007:-----Hey Rohl, yesterday I talked to Edge about possibly becoming a member of Daksoul.he sounded like a very good character, one who values loyalty, skills and statting. He says he isn't much of a pk kinda guy but he backs up his people which is good. He used to play a lot waaaaaay back as Tarent. I think he'd be a good addition. Whatcha think? Holler back!EscUza"
