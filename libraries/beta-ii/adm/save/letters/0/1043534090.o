__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Mochaprincess to Hepualahaole Sat Sep 14 08:40:57 2002:-----    Guild treaty-  I'm only 13 so this is not gonna be that proffessional or whateverso, any wayz. 1. No member of my guild will pk anyone in you guildso for this reason no one from your guild will pk anyone in my guild.If this is violated then the treaty is broken. I know that Aximili canget really annoying sometimes (believe me I live with him) but, if hegets too bad that you just really wanna pk him, please talk to me firstand I will talk to him about it. I would like to be a peace will all guilds cause I don't really like pk unless there's a really good reasonfor it. I also don't allow members of my guild to pk unless they talkto me or Rethlan first. Anywayz, I would really apriciate it if you would agree to this treaty, thanx :).     Luv ya,   Mocha "
