__Letter "I believe that the reasons people kill is simply no more than:#1 They want to tell all their friends they were stronger or more cunning than someone and killed them.#2 They want the exhilaration of the hunt.#3 They want experiance, and MOBS no longer hold any excitement for them.#4 They want money or items that the person has.Or, The most common:#5 They deeply and intensly hate someone, so they want to kill them over and over untill the person loses heart and quits."
