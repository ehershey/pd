__Letter "the assignment was to do a small village I could put in the existing forest. all you needed to do was around 30-50 room, all inside a small centaur village, no board, store, etc. well maybe one general store. just quick and easy high quality areas. Just the village, no surrounding areas. I am sorry if I did not make this clear at first but it is what I need done.Stormy"
