__Letter "The attacks_shark.c is working but i wish to modify it guys.I want to remove the limb by causing the persons body[\"limb\"][\"damage\"] to be greater then their body[\"limb\"][\"max_dam\"] so the system will remove it.The problem im seeing looking at the do_damage() func is it cuts the damamge down SEVERLY. To the point that you would have to pass a number so large that you would be flat out killing the person to remove the limb.What i want help on is to design my own function similar to do_damage but would load the players body mapping, read the target limb's max_dam and then pass that value to the limb's damage....hence removing it The way %^RED%^tear%^RESET%^ works now is it deletes the limb and dishs out some damamge. but then we gotta remove all attacked limbs, equip, weaponds, etc, etc, etcI would rather make the limb fall off and let the system do all that :)IronmanP.S. -- Theres no rush on this guys. I have 60 rooms left to put in for level 3 and then all of level 4 to finish :) so we have time to iron this out."
