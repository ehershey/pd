__Letter "hey dood. draven here..me and tyste been talkin'daos said that vampire will be based on playing time. not birthday age..i think..that it should be the other way aroundfor many reasons:1) any mook can idle 24/7 with a dsl connection or cable. which would mean just sittin there all day all night getting buffer..doesnt add up manif it was birthday..the older the vampire the stronger..which makes sense like in all the movies n stuffwell..peace=P"
