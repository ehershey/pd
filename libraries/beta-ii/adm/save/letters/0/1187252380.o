__Letter "hey there, glad to see youre back :) i wanted to see if you'd look into something for me... a while back i disrespected nulvect on chronicus and got arrested, thats not the problem, when i logged back on as spade, my main, he arrested him as well, you can look in the arrest log for a reason, i bet its a bs reason. the thing is, i dont see how warrick can get a character back that wasnt even his to begin with (it was given to him by another player) and all my attempts have been futile at getting spade back, a character that didnt break any rules in the first place. thanks for the time. :)"
