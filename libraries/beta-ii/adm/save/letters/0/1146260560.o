__Letter "Hi Whit,I still haven't ever been told I broke a law (this is Vyce btw). I notice charechters that have suicided have been allowed to get their charechter back (cyan). However I who have not broken a single rule am BANNED. Can you please let me know if I can get my charechter back? This is extreemly unfair and improper treatment by Nesoo. My email is Msstaves@hotmail.com.Thanks Whit. Hope all is well with you,-- Vyce"
