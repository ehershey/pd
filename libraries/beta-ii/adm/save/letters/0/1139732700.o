__Letter "I have no idea, lol.  As for the calendar command, awesome!  I moved it over to here from the mudlib I created from scratch.  I never felt like getting it to work though.  As for peopleg, its been there since I created the guild system.  You just seemed excited when you made listguilds so I didnt say anything.  Sorry man.Whit"
