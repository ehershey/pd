__Letter "That would kinda be redundant. Just go type \"lines\" on the buildersport. I have it installed over there. The whole idea was to give amore compact readout for the command. People can still see easilyif they have the line turned on or off. IMO its easier with minethan the older command.Only question mark is if we want a player to be able to tell whatlines a person is listening to or not using this command. Currentlyit is coded to only alow archwizards to do this.Please peek at it when you got a sec. It's fairly streight foward."
