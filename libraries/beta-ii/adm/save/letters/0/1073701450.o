__Letter "First of all, it doesn't state anywhere in rules that I've been able to find, that it is not okay to have more than one locker in a guild hall. elp guild addons> just says how much a locker costs and doesn't say that you can't have more than one.  Furthermore, I want to know how the hell forsaken knew that I posted that they had two lockers on the Ethereal board. There are no one in Ethereal who would backstab like that, and Eios claims that you told him that I posted it, and now he's sending all of forsaken after Ethereal. You wanna explain how he knows?  -jen"
