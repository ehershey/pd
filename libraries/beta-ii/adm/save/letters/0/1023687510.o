__Letter "It's me, your favorite dragon :P, anyhoo, I need to talk to you about my spells.  for magic attack, I have one kataan spell (darkmist), one cleric spell, I think, (annihilate) and one necromancer spell (disease), now these are fine spells, but not one of them works with wizardry, which is one of the magic skills I have.  They hit, but they don't hit, if that makes any sense.  I propose that if you want to use these spells, maybe clone it and change the name on the spells, and tailor the magic skills to reflect the change.  I don't want serious damage, but it would be nice if it hits once in awhile with a little bit more punch then my regular level one ability *bite*I want I want I want, kinda sounds selfish of me...sorry.  I'm mad, not at you, I should have never talked to joey and compared skills with him, I thought I was doing a killer job, and now I know I'm not *sigh*  (funny thing is, I rather play this one then my kataan, cause it does do a killer job in xping)..sorry, I'm still rambling.  well, in either way you decide, can you let me know of the outcome?  ThanksYour, (maybe not so much now) favorite dragon:P"
