__Letter "Hey lady. :) I hope you're doing better than you were the other daywhen you heard about your friend and all. I was giving some thoughtto the whole guild stuff dilemma. I would like coded a mask whichcould perform the function of mage robes. I think I would call it:%^BOLD%^D%^RESET%^ea%^BOLD%^th%^RESET%^'%^BOLD%^s %^RESET%^He%^BOLD%^ad m%^RESET%^as%^BOLD%^k%^RESET%^This way, it wouldnt need a great amount of armour valueand could be appreciated by everyone in the guild. Pardon any odd spacing. Looked at a help file mid message.If that isn't possible, please let me know and I will think of a substitution. Or if you have any suggestions that could lead me in the right direction? Thanks!Esco"
