__Letter "Hey honey. I got online tonight and found out you were watching anime. I didn't know how long you would be, but I stayed on for about an hour and a half to two hours waiting for you and chatting with prator. With my luck you'll log on as soon as i leave, but i'm very tired tonight and it's 11:45. Bedtime calls. So sorry i didn't stay up to wait for you. As always, I'll see you when i see you. *Savannah kisses you sweetly. \"Get better soon,\" she says before she winks at you and vanishes to the shadows.*"
