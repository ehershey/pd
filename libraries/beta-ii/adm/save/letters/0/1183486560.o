__Letter "i have a few ideas for vampires if you don't understand ask carina i was discusing it with her earlier on the phonevampires have sensitive hearing, expand sense of smell, especially the smell of blood. with the hearng part if there is another player in the same area like two rooms away a line would pop up to you that will alert you in knowing to get out or prepare to fight, and the sense of smell they can learn an other person sent and can help you out in tracking them it could be call sent or blood sent. just a few things i came up with an if you don't understand what i'm saying i told carina everything just have a hard time explaining it in a mud mailsorry it this is all running together i sent it to nulvect on accidentsorry another thing that just came to mind is that i think humans and weaker vampires are more vulnerable to become control but i also think there contol should be based on charis. but i think there should be something that can counter that with another stat which ever you see fit "
