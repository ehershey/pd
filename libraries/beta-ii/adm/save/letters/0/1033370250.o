__Letter "Well, the main thing in the letter i sent you wasn't so much about Ashram, that part i wanted you to know that as a player/ex-imm/friend i did understand and actually agreed with you desting him, that part was actually ment to try and make you feel like not everyone out there shoots first then ask's questions. My main concern was for the item that allowed them to teleport into their guild, and since seeker did say he wanted no such item in the game, are they keeping theirs? If they are, I would like to know so i can get the hook up and get my butt into coding somethign like it for our guild!-Faust"
