__Letter "Well, I am all about the 3 Stooges type stuff myself.  I do love a goodjoke, especially if it is aimed at me.  I can take a joke, I love practicaljokes.I relish the idea of being the Xen to your Axe, however, I do get a kickout of putting x-lax in place of someone's chocolate bar.  I am in love with you as well as saying \"I loe you\", that makesit more intense.  (\"I love you\") up there, the v got left out.I will sign this off, I do love you,xoxoYour Xeniaxoxo"
