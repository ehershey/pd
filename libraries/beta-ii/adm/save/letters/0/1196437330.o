__Letter "That is my nickname for my niece. The one that's getting marriedtoday in NYC. I suppose I have to drive there like...very soon.Dont really wanna be there, because I may convey the wrongemotions but I'll go and stay strong and pray for the rightspirit about all this. I am off. NYC, here I come. :) No sleepjust yet, it'll have to wait a bit. But I will get some soon, Ipromise. :) Missing you already. I hope you have a good sleep.I hope you had good dreams or even no dreams. Anyhow, we willtalk another time. Not sure when I be back online but when Iget the chance, I will mail you. :) Take care, sweet lady. :)Love,Me"
