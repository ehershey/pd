__Letter "Hiya,yes I know sleep is important.  It seems I have something strange calledfibromyalgia, which is caused from stress and can affect your body.Doc said I had it before and it's a flare-up.  I'm extremely tired and hadbody aches, like the flu.So, it's possible that bringing up all this stuff in sessions is causing mybody to react again.  I had done some serious discussions about Nick and what he did to meand it was extremely difficult.I forgot something too.... when I was talking to you about the thing with Jand douching, it wasn't that so much as the treatment for infections.The \"d\" word is not good for women to do at all and I know that and Itold J that I knew that and he had said that he didn't allow me to dothat.  The treatment of infections is okay to do every day, that is whatdoc meant. lolSo, I will try to get on and off, right now I'm so tired and I slept 9 or sohours last night.  Hugs and hope to talk to you soon, miss you.Moving on March 1 (Saturday) and internet won't be installed until the4th, so I will have to figure out something in between times.xoxo"
