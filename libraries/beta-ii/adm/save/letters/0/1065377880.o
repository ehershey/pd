__Letter "Ive installed the new banishment system.  Heres the specs:2 types of banishment.1: Regular.  This is only used to prevent an ip from making new characters.  Good for stopping Cenn from playing, but allowing old AOL users to still play.2: Total.  This will disconnect any user trying to connect to the mud.  Good for stopping pricks from playing.To regular ban someone, use <banish>/<unbanish> and to total ban someone, use <totalban>/<untotalban>Whit"
