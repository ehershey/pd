__Letter "I've noticed that the items can store and execute a (: :) pointer.The smell, listen and search ones can not. HOWEVER i have experimenteda little and if you do a set_listen( (: BOO :) ); as opposed to a set_listen( (: \"BOO\" :) );it will execute the function i have on my workroom called BOO() for the first one but NOT for the second one......I'm not sure but it seems that /std/room/senses.c might have a bug in it fellas..Ironman"
