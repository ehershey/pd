__Letter "yeah, I know kabaal.  He was removed from his imm position at pd1 because of setting characters up, but as far as multiplaying, etc, I dont think he'd do that.  And about cenn...  it'd be pretty pointless to let someone play only if they're going to be constantly harassed.  Annoying as he may be, if everyone ignored him instead of goading him on, he'd be a whole lot quieter.                          -Nightshade"
