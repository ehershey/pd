__Letter "It's just a game, what are you getting so worked up about? What is with all these unbalanced people who want to beat up people in real life because that person's character is not nice to your own? You guys have some serious issues.Oh yeah, if no one cares, then why have you made such an issue out of it all? You've said you don't exp, so all you would be doing here is what? Talking? Or pk'ing people to be an asshole? Or perhaps you pk people to make yourself feel better.Why should I look in the mirror and re-think my life, just because I am being a prick to people who keep abusing me? You guys started *all* of this by not shutting up about the scripting. Kumi actually managed to settle things, but you guys have the broad-mindedness of fascist fanatic."
