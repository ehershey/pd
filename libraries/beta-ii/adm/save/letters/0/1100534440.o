__Letter "I'm game if you are...9 orbs or 4?  Also that would have to be last in putting in....the world will be different right?  But that won't affect the rest of the quest.  Also autoloadable or no?  AND  will other people have dragon-related statues or idea on thier areas?see...lots of questions...I also have statues that the orbs were suppose to orignally go to start the quest... you want that spread across...instead of finding orbs for the statues, you find the statues for the orbs?Or, I can keep it as orignally planned, look all over for the 9 orbs that would reveal a secret entrance to a cave where the statues are located.....in the mean time I will work backwards and do the last part of the quest since that is all in one area  :)P.S. You don't have to make excuses for you lazy un-employed ass....it wasn't the part I wanted to talk to in the first place ;PHep"
