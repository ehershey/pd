__Letter "I know... you're still pissed at me. But, on the flip side, I still don't have anything against you. Hope you can understand buisness is buisness. I have 3 of your diamonds... but someone else saced your corpse. I'll give you 30K gold to buy things back. And, as a personal favor, I'll get you 3 items, any of your choosing, that you don't think you can get right now. Even 60 oils to help you xp. I think that should be a fair showing of my good faith and lack of bad feelings. If you don't want it, that's cool to.Cookie"
