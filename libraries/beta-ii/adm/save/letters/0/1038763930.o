__Letter "The start zone is the town square of Rhondale at \"/wizards/aziraphale/keep/rooms/zvillage/[].c\"Hopefully there can be a proper dock to teh west rather than just a beach to land on.The main exp area is to the north through the gate. The guards keep you from leaving to not have players get themselves killed.I hope the area is ok, and that it gets put in.Mail me for changes needed, or perhaps change them yourself and please notify so I don't for the woo myself because I am wrong. %^RESET%^CYAN%^*** %^BOLD%^WHITE%^Prator %^RESET%^CYAN%^***"
