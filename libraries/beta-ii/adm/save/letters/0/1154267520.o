__Letter "Hey Rohl, it's me Vayne/Warrick. I'm tired of everyone knowing me on those characters so this is my new main one. If you could could you just tell everyone in the guild that Warrick/Vayne is more than likely going on a vacation from Primal for a while? (kick them out if you want) And induce this guy? I promise stats will be up there and everything. I won't fail darksoul. I'm just tired of the hustle and bustle around my two other chars.thansk"
