__Letter "Um, one of the codes I need a little bit more tweaking to it, what I need is some sort of paralyze code that will keep the player in the action....meaningRight now if I type climb rock and after I type that I go south, the messages will still call out, and even though I'm in another room, I will end up climbing the rocks to the top, so what I want to do is if they type climb rocks and the message calls are going through, they would be unable to go another direction.I hope this made sense...if not I'll show you it"
