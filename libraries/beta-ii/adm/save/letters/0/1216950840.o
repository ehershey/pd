__Letter "Ok, so Cenn approached me the other day...I think it was Friday or Saturday this last week here..But anyway, he's seeking admittance into Unholy.  I'v pretty much sworn off recruiting myself, im not around often enough to see the fresh talent and all...But yea, I suggested that he seek you out and try finding a way to enter into Unholy that way.Personally...Im kinda 'iffy' about admitting him into our fold.  However, he 'could' be useful for some things.  He's usually around the MUD at least.However, if you feel he can be a good addition to our army of darkness...Perhaps we should brainstorm a task that he needs complete to gain admittance...Something challenging, or...perhaps a kill.  But we'll figure out what the task will be at a later time, if its deemed that he will be useful to the Guild.So uhh...Yea...Meant to send this last week, just been busy all weekend and week so far.  really the first chance I got online for any amount of time.  But again, and im blabbering, we should talk this out next time we're both unidle around here.. Or on msn if I ever login to that again."
