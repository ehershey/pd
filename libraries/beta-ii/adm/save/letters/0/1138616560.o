No problem it seemed likeHowever this morning when I logged on it put me in tirun square... which normally isnt a big deal at the time except that I was an outlaw (which is why i set myself to start in the fighter hall).I lost a ton of irreplacable items and 22 black diamonds. Please can you replace what I lost due to this bug? I would have served my time while my stuff was safe in lastsaints hall like i always due.Please.-- Vyce"
