__Letter "Hello, sweet love. :) The super long day is officially over! I amfinally home again, entering bed roughly 26 hrs. after leaving itand I hardly fell asleep at work much. :D I was in a dormitorywitha  portable DVD player and watched a lot of MASH. :) That waspretty much the highlight of the night. I got lunch late and wasunable to find you. :( Well, today should be muuuuuuch better. :DSee you later, my love.Love,Your James"
