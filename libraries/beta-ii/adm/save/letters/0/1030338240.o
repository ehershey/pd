__Letter "It's not like you have taken him from me, you haven't.  Paul and I have been friends for along time.  He cares for me no less then before, just as i care no less for him.  Yes i might have less time with him, but that is all that has changed, over the last couple month there has been alot of things that have taken his time from me, i work around them. He has promised he will make time and that is all i need.Wisp"
