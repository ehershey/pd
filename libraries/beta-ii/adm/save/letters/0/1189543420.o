__Letter "Please allow me to tell you a bit about myself and my background. I haveworked in elementary and high schools in Mesa, Arizona. At the high school,I had the pleasure of working with the Special Education in the HearingImpaired department. This was my first experience with the inclusion program.I have always been interested in teaching. My only dilemma was subject matter:english or mathematics. As it stands, I have decided to major in english with a minor in math.          When it comes to observation, I know that you have I-STEP testing9throughout the coming week, so I hope we may find a convenient time to speak.I am available anytime on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. Please let me knowwhat times work best for you. I look forward to meeting with you and observingyour class. I hope to hear from you soon and that all goes well.Thank you,Triple S!"
