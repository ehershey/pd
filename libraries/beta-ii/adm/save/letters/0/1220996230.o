__Letter "I am glad you enjoyed your time. Necron can be quite reckless and I am sure he laughed when he was felled. I am glad you were able to escaped unharmed. I hear also that our fellow guildmate Cyan gave a helping hand. I look forward to our journeys together and I assure you our time will be of adventurer and not rampant killings. I see you are close to become a high mortal of this land. This is most pleasing.Till we speak againYours Always Jynteral"
