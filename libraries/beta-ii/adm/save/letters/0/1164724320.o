__Letter "Yah... I don't know what you want from ME.. But i told your mom that i never cheated on you and everything else.. and aparently Kat was talking to you for a while too... and Nothing she told you, the TRUTH btw.. never seemed to get across to you. But i'd just like to set some things straight. #1 - You're going to have a Son. #2 - I never cheated on you. And #3 - I didn't write that on my myspace, and now that i have a laptop and internet, i'm going to take it off.   That's the jist of it.  The next move is yours.Bye James.          - Fate."
