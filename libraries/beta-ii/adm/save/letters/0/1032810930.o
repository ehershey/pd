__Letter "I never thought for a moment that you would kill me, bro.  You, Faust, and Cookie are the people I would absolutly refuse to kill for whatever reason.  So it's all good around here.  Oh, and Soulfly, too.As far as Gabriel goes? I really don't know him that well, I *do* know he bitches alot but we're indifferent of each other so I didn't care when you offed him, I just wanted confrimation.As far as Forsaken goes? I'm gonna smack Seth when he hits HM. But Lucifer bugs me.  He's elite and an assassin so he could probably kill me with a backstab.  I buddy listed him, though and will just have to watch my step.In any case, try not to get ambushed, eh? I would hate for five people to gang up on you 'cause that would mean I would have to spend days finding and killing those punks individually. Hehe.Later!"
