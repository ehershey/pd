__Letter "His 2-person \"kill spree\" over 4 days is far less than Sopboohas done on whims. Just because he buries items that don't autoloadfor him, you call him an animal. It isnt right. We dontsteal each other's humanity. Stuff can be replaced. People cant.And in the end, stuff is just stuff.You miss that."
