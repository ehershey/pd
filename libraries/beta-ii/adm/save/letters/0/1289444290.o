__Letter "I have a charge for $8.10 on 10-26, tracking #405938435647,and another charge for $12.92 on 10-29, tracking #873580628946.The first one ($8.10) was sent express saver (3 day), the second one ($12.92)was sent priority overnight. If I look at the original prices itcomes out to a total of $54.46 which is pretty close to what yourinvoice says. Check the tracking numbers, it's probably already paid."
