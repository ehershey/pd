__Letter "unfortunately, i'll be in rochester then - i wont be around much for awhile, actually. I'm moving back to rochester at the end of May, so my computer is going to be packed up fairly soon. After then, i doubt i'll be around much at all. preparations for moving to Japan will be taking up most of my time.This is why i haven't wanted to get into anything with anyone - this time was always on the horizon. I hope I do get a chance to talk to you again soon, though. I miss you."
