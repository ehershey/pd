__Letter "I am not actively out to PK you as of right now. I will let the past slide for now because you werent a dick as an Imm. The last 2 months have been fine and that is enough for peace in my mind.But know this. You walk a thin line. You wrong me or a darksoul or AoD member then you best watch your back. I pked you 3 months ago. If i kill you now it is not harassment and you have been warned. I will not pk without reason tho and i have no urge to pk in general. Hopefully things will be fine. I'll stay out of your way and you stay out of mine.-- Ash"
