__Letter "Sorry I poofed, love. I needed to talk to a supervisor regardinga grievance I need to handle for a fellow employee who was sleeping on duty even though it was during his break. We get intoa sketchy kinda gray area. Hopefully, I will see you on Mondayeven though I have class that day. Oooh, you're back! Bye and hi. :)Love,Your James"
