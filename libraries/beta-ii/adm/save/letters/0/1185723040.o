__Letter "I have coded a mortal holding pen on builders. If a mortal is created,they will now be dumped into that room instead of the Tirun square.The room instructs them to come here instead of there if they are nota builder. Any builder or higher can trans the mortal out of the room.I did this to keep prying eyes from looking around when not invited.Ironman"
