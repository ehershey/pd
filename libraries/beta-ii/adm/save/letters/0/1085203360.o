__Letter "Hi. First of all welcome back. It is good to see a voice of reason and fairness again.The issues I have to bring up relate to balance. I know that you are concerned with law, however many of the others are friends with certain players or even RL friends with players. Simply put I only have confidence in you, and thus you are the only one I really trust to be fair in issues. That said I have noticed some serious balance issues and I wanted to let you know them.First off zerkers. Not just raknid but zerkers in general are overpowered. Fighter are overpowered on the whole due to normal rounds + abilities but rage makes a huge difference. I'm sure you know this one already from the number around.Secondly the guild gear has gotten out of hand. I noticed a lot of players using guild eq lately, in praticular guild weapons over dragon slayers and wolf claws (the best fighter/rogue weapons in game from monsters). I recently joined Ethereal and now I see that it is infact an enormous balance issue. Here are a couple examples:1) My ethereal badge: It instantly put me to fully armored all over and now elite players slashes barely even scratch me (tauran does less than 20 with slash to me).Special armors: They are essentially mage robes but have very high AC along with specials that grant SP in large ammounts. This does away with the one drawback of fighters/rogues which is SP costs of abilities. This makes fighters/rogues overpowered compared to magic classes.Eidolon blade: Every special does damage, paralyzes, gives sp, and gives hp. THe ammounts are huge too. I get up to 200 hp/sp back per special and it specials around 1 in 4 hits. I can use kill all in tenebrae throne room and never die and i can attack 4 monsters in forbidden forest and never die there either. This is obsene. I assume many other guild weapons are this way as well.The guild weapons/armor/ect make fighters/rogues way too strong in comparisson to mages, and take out of the game the excitement of hunting for new gear. The old limits of gear from when PD opened were much better... essentially the guild gear could not be better than that which is found from killing the hardest monsters.Another issue that isn't exactly balance but it something I noticed. Nightshade did a nice job balancing the power of area attacks in his rebalance. However all abilities/spells now are near copies of one another. My slash/rush/headbutt/jab/whirl are all the same move (same damage same sp). This makes for a little less interest and variety in the game.I just wanted to let you know, as I regard you as the most trustworthy member of the staff. Once again its good to have you back.-- Vyce"
