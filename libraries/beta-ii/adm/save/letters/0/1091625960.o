__Letter "The guild has pk'd people simply for joining other guilds - Simply to say thatyou don't betray your chosen guild.It is extremely wrong to post something for a person in another guild. Wedidn't just come here to chat, we were playing the game with this guild.You may want to inform Tsuke that Illuminati was never about killing the evilplayers, especially since the orignal leader was a demon necromancer, thendemon kataan. We've always had demons and evil players in the guild. Also tellhim that the guild was originally set up to be 'elitist' - the very premise ofthe Illuminati is to be the driving force behind the world. We did what we setout to do, and that is to be the most powerful guild in the mud.On the subject of cheating - that is in the hands of the admins. I am not surewhere he got that getting off lightly thing, but Nightshade did remove that 600million experience. Also, why didn't Tsuke ever actually say something in allthat time?I don't understand what he means by the guild being full of power hungryplayers, as there are only a few that really play now.Oh, while we are voicing all our grievances, maybe you could also pass this onto Tsuke/Helena - Why didn't I ever get my character Prator back afterStormbringer siad to me that he would re-instate it. Or get my proper immstatus, before I played Aziraphale, when I completed my area. He isn't the onlyone that has been 'let-down' by others here.Oh yeah, removed for posting for a character in another guild, and leakinginfo."
