__Letter "this is from his explination of the money onIronman says: take the 3 prices..... staff_price, guild-price, seller_priceIronman says: perhaps we can have the staff_price be a \"tariff\" or \"tax\" on the sale of the items.... subtracting that from the sale priceIronman says: something like thisYou say: i know what you mean by tariff  You say: you don't ahve to explain it  Ironman says: AP - SP - GP == final priceIronman says: guild getting their asking part of the transactionsIronman says: im thinking of this more for guilds honestly....... give people a REAL incentive for being in guildsYou say: but these would not be inside guilds, they would be owned by guilds  Ironman says: the other option is the 2 storefront option.... if the guild wants to offer their membership a discountYou say: so any player could use them, it all depends on what treasures you can provide for the public  Ironman nods solemnly.Ironman says: basically yesIronman smiles happily.Ironman says: ya got the general ideaYou say: yeah..i'm not stupid  Ironman says: never thought ya was :)You say: here's the thing about membership discounts  You say: that i'm not sure about, b/c they are getting profit as a guild anyway  Ironman says: well there would be a limiting range there..... can only cut it down to the guilds asking priceYou say: yet it is obvious that they should  You say: so idk  Ironman says: thinking of it this wayYou say: as long as it's not like a huge discount or anything  You say: i'd say like 1-5% discount  Ironman says: lets say staff askes 90k, guild asks 150k, person askes 200k...... well the guild can cut back up to 60k..... the difference between staff and guild pricingYou say: hmm  Ironman says: the 90k >> 150k is what would go into the guild ........ over the guild price is what the person getsYou say: i understand iron  You say: i'm thinking  Ironman says: the staff's price is the rockbottom, barebones price we will allow on the given itemYou say: i know  Ironman says: im saying that the guildmaster can have the option of cutting down the guilds markup for members is allYou say: ok question  Ironman nods solemnly.Ironman says: sorry... ya know i repeat myself at times :(Ironman sighs deeply.You ask: you said they would get up to 60k, then you said it would be over the guild price that is what the person gets...that would man 50k (if they used the prices shown), and that the 90 - 150k is what would go into the guild so which one is it?  Ironman says: ok lets do it this wayYou say: i dont need it explained  You say: just tell me which it is  Ironman says: ok person asks 200k ...... 50 is the persons, 150 is the guilds ..... now if the staff wishes they can cut their portion down as low as 90k ( the staff's min pricing) ..... so members would get it for 140k not 200kYou say: like i said  You say: don't explain it to me  You say: just tell me  Ironman says: its split is what im sayingIronman says: part to guild, part to personYou ask: so here's the question, how are you going to split things, is it going to be what the staff memebrs asks goes to the guild, and then what's left over goes to the person that sold the item?  Ironman says: or we could have it that guild_price + person_price has to be >= the staff_priceYou say: bc if so, then that will be abused big time  Ironman says: hrmYou say: i don't think that people should get any money from the profits  Ironman asks: let it all go into the guild ??You say: i think it should all go to the guild, and they money they get is like normal when they sell it to the stores  Ironman ponders the situation.Ironman says: people wouldnt bother using it then.... they would just use auctionYou say: which that's all this is, an auction both pretty much..only prices are set  You say: people should not get money for the amount they chose to sell it for, split between guild and them or not  Ironman says: diff is that the store inventory is there for brousingYou say: and i definitly do not think they should have a store inventory  You say: here's my decision, don't start on anything because there are too many things I don't agree with  Ironman says: well talk it over with nulvect and/or stormbringer than before i startIronman says: nulvect liked the idea when him and i was talking .... so well sort it outIronman just needs to know what everyone wants it doing is allYou say: i will talk to him about it, and i'm the one that runs guilds  You say: and since it's a guild thing, it's up to me  You say: and that's what nul and storm will say  Ironman shrugs helplessly.You say: so things will need to be reworked if it goes in  You say: but i will talk to nul about it  Ironman says: perhaps we should have a 3 way talk with himYou say: maybe after i talk to him  You say: but i willt alk to him alone"
