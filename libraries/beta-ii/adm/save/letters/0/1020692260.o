__Letter "I'm not usre how many times I have said this at the beginning of an email, but you seem to be the guy that is around the most and that is why send these things to you.Looking over the fighter board I see alot of talk about fighters not being powerful enough.godspeed aziraphaleI have a bit of free time at the moment and I thought that to help out I could make a couple of plain damage abilities, one for each fighter class, so that the fighters can do a bit more damage. This presents an opportunity for the fighter classes to use their new skills...Anyway, if say 'yea' then I'll just come up with random stuff for approval. If you say 'nay' then I'll go do other stuff.	- Aziraphale"
