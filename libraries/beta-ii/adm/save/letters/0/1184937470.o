__Letter "That was the general idea stormy. I wanted to have like 3-5 dedicatedplayers that would be willing to put areas thru their paces from aplayer's perspective. I do agree with you about the secrecy issue.It was the whole reason i drove a truck thru the BuildSecure.c andput my own system in place. There were major holes that builders and/ora player could go onto builders and start walking around in a builder'sfiles. My system would prevent that from happening. THe builder wouldneed to concent to the p-tester having access to their files and givethem \"guest\" access to their area. Also, it would be a seperate postfrom builders or players. The p-tester would need an archwizard oradministrator to xmote them into the p-tester post. General playercharacters would have NO ACCESS at all to a players files. The exceptionwill be those contained in a seperate function i will add to theworkroom inherit so the builder can name his/her personal characters.In summary, The p-tester position would require an arch to turn theplayer character into a p-tester with xmote. The builder would thenneed to grant them access to their files with my security system.There will be no way for a general player just to log onto the buildersport and just start walking around boss. You know im down-right rabidwhen it comes to protecting quest information... they WILL NOT learnof quests unless the builder WANTS them knowing.Ironman"
