__Letter "Hi babe......Im writing to tell you....I want to stay in the game. I know I already told you this..but by writing it down on PD makes me feel better. I want to stay..and I'll wait till your exams are done. I want to learn howto play the game....and I want to be an assassin like you. I want to be like my 'husband'..if thats ok.I want to be the same level as you.....and I want you to help me. I don't want to push you away, from the gameor from my life. Please....except my apology, and lets just have fun with this game. Lets think of it as a fresh start.I don't care whose on.....as long as you're on with me....I feel safe. I just want to be with you. I will see you later ok....I love you.....Froggie\""
