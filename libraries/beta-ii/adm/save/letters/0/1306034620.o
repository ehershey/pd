__Letter "well, i plan on becoming more active if given leadership. as you can tell from before, i was the one donating money to purchase things for the guild, and the only one submitting ideas for guild items, which skunk never acted on.i plan on building the guild population back up, it was me alone last time that got the guild going again. with the pregnancy of my girlfriend my playing time fell and when i went inactive everyone fell apart without ol baine here to bind it together."
