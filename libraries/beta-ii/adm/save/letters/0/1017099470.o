__Letter "Hey khale, Wuz ^??? N*M*H j*c. You said to mail you so I am. I'll probably mail you everday this week, but n*e wayz, You'll never guess what I found out. Leviathas just told me he was jealous cause he had always thought of me as his wife. That's sweet, but hey don't think i'm backing out of our wedding, believe me I'd NEVER do that. You know when I told you about the lock-in and how my ex was going with his new girlfriend and how I was all upset. Well, she went but he didn't and she was all over this one guy she even started making out with him. When her best friend asked her about Jason she goes what about him so now everyone one is telling him about how I would treat him better than that and he should go with me. I seriously think he's gonna ask me out to!!!!!!!!!!!! N*e wayz, I g2g so I'll see ya Saturday!!!!!!!!! Luv Ya,Angel"
