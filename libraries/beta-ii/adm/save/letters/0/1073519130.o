__Letter "I do not recall authorizing Bellos to PK you. Furthermore, not only would I not allow a member of Ethereal to PK another member of Ethereal, but it is also against PD rules to PK a member of the same guild. As for his custom item, have him come talk to me, and I'll have it readded to his inventory. Also, you should have him talk to me about PKing or stealing from yousHarming other members of Ethereal is not tolerated in this guild. -Kumi"
