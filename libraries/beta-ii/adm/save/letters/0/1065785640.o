__Letter "ok... once again half of my stuff has just miraculously disappeared, for the second time. this time im am sure that i didnt sell em/ drop em/ bury em/ give em away etc, cause i checked before i logged off and i was in the square, carrying everything. im missing pretty much exactly the same stuff as last time: drow general eq(spider armour, boots), nightstalker stuff(belt, 3 skullrings), darkmail, bloody leather dress and skeleton gloves... thats all so far. i dont mean to bitch but seriously, this is ridiculous... second time its happened and i cant keep gettin it back, especially the drow stuff. see what u can do bout it... and if at all possible do u think u can replace some of my stuff? thx"
