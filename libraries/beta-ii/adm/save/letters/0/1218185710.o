__Letter "The darkness in this room is overwhelming, yet light somehow emerges through.  Most of the stones seem to be made of the darkest onyx possible, battling the few white crystals trying to create light.  Brightness and dimness changes with every footstep, overpowering visual senses with confusion.  A dusty skeleton of some sort of creature leans against a rock, something left to die.  Bats soar above to different surfaces they can hang from, screeching occasionally."
