__Letter "I've spoken with another guild leader and have decided you need to be watched a little more before we let you in. I'm sorry if you lost any equipment, I'm willing to go grab whatever you lost. If you wanna be in the guild, the best thing I think for now is just to chat with me and other guild members so we get to know you a bit. That is all"
