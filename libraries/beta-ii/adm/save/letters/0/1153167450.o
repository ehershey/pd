__Letter "If you dont mind me asking, what is approximately the average age ofplayers here. Just from the newbie line, and admittingly still in highschoolor have just finished, is it safe to say under 21? Or is it just thetime of day that is making the average age seem skewed?Also, checked the website for PD. Which is you? Holding the sword, or theone kneeling with the sword to his neck?Anyway, I only asked about the age thing because I'm on the olderside of most mudders these days.Myr"
