__Letter "Ok, here it is. :D%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Minori and Minori area%^RESET%^:  %^CYAN%^Complete or Almost Complete%^RESET%^:    Rice fields - The rice fields code is complete, it's basically a matter                   of copying out the virtual rooms. The total amount of work                  left to do is probably only four hours or so. 95% complete.    Sakura Forest - 100% complete. This (small) area is ready to be checked.    Trade District - 95% complete. Only a few rooms are missing here, and                      what's there is complete. Minor touchups in some places                      perhaps.    Commercial District - 85% complete. One or two stores are missing, and                           one or two are missing storekeepers. This is minor                           copy/paste work however and should only be an hour                           or twoto finish the last bits.    Orc Fields - 85% complete. Mobs need tweaking, but the bugs associated                  with them have been solved. Probably needs five hours work                  to finish.    Quex'trilixil's Lair - Quex'trilixil's Lair is 100% complete, which                            includes underwater code and the mountain ranges                            to the east of the city. Also includes the deed                            to get the spell Bereavement, which in turn is                            also complete.        Road to the City - The road to the city from the forest is 100% complete,                       up to where the forest is complete.    Bastion of Hope - 95% complete. This massive tower (originally designed                       to be an area on it's own) is nearly complete. It                       simply needs to have the last few rooms ironed out and                       some mob-spawning problems dealt with.    Player <-> Mob interaction - This code is 100% complete and functional                                  on all mobs to which it's applied.    Forgable weapons - This vast coding project is 95% complete. The weapons                        need specials, but this code should be easily                        completed and is only a minor task. (freaking finally)  %^CYAN%^Incomplete or Uncommenced%^RESET%^:    Residential District - 30% complete. This is probably the least developed                           part of the city, although the framework has been                           laid for the player-housing daemon. In that                            respect, it is complete- except the NPC's need                            houses. This is of course optional. So it's either                            30% or 90%. I'd like to have NPC housing but it's                            not required.    Slums - This area has not yet been commenced but a fair portion of it is            formed by the player-housing daemon. The amount of work to finish             it is probably only three or four hours worth.    Forest south of the city - This forest is about 40% complete. It needs                                more mobs and rooms. This is a slightly larger                                job, taking up probably five or six hours to                                finish.    Seven Isles - This island chain off the coast of Minori is mostly                   incomplete with scattered rooms about and a few bugs. This                   area is completely optional but gives me a chance to fully                   experiment with my underwater code. Really only about 25%                   complete, but can be finished as a module and added at any                  time.  %^CYAN%^Current bugs%^RESET%^:    -- Mobs speak to each other sometimes, or react to their own speach. The        source of this is not clear. It could be a problem with the driver or        a problem more deeply routed in the way the MUD works.    -- Storekeepers are non-functional, but this is simply a matter of        copying the code from existing storekeepers.    -- Some quests arn't complete (but can be added as modules later).      %^CYAN%^Potential bugs/abuses%^RESET%^:    -- Players could somehow force-respawn the ricefields to create infinate        mobs (but not infinate mobs in a single room) if they somehow had the        power to do so.  %^CYAN%^Comments%^RESET%^:    The city itself is about 80% complete. The work that remains is not     mentally taxing and simply requires one to copy/paste out virtual rooms,     fix minor bugs or complete small features. The surrounding area is more     complete- it is almost ready to be added. One potential way the city     could be added is to finish off the ricefields virtual rooms (and other     potential bugs), then simply add the area as is, with the areas not yet     complete sealed off and opened whenever they're ready. Areas which would     need to be sealed off would be sections of the forest (although it could     be simply added as is, and expanded upon later) and the underwater parts     (including the seven isles). This will get a large amount of the code     into the game immediately, and could open up possibilities with events     to open each subarea and such. %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Abilities%^RESET%^:  %^CYAN%^Combat%^RESET%^:    Confuse, a Wanderer abilitity, is 90% complete, but a bug with the size     of the array of silly things the victim may say causes it to not run.     I'll look into a workaround or a bugfix the next time I see Daos.    Edgespin, a buffed version of Bladedance, is 50% complete.    Esconce, a hiding ability for young dragons (especially black) is     100% complete.    Stampede, a group ability for the cavalier class is 60% complete.    Thrust, an ability for scouts and fighters, is 90% complete.    Chomp, an ability for shapeshifted Druids (in snake, wolf and other     forms) is 100% complete.    A modified version of trip (making it more useful and do more damage)     is 10% complete.  %^CYAN%^Non Combat%^RESET%^: %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Spells%^RESET%^:  %^CYAN%^Combat%^RESET%^:    Dragonfear, a group-paralyze spell for dragons, is 100% complete.    Icestorm, an area affect spell for druids and wizards, is 100%     complete.    Immolation, a level 50 fighting spell for anti-paladins, is 90%     complete bug a bug prevents it from working properly.    Internection, a level 60 area affect spell for anti-paladins, is 100%     complete.    Manasink, a ~level 25 dispell-magic spell for mages, is 100% complete.    Poisonwind, ~level 20 spell for druids, wizards and necromancers is     100% complete.    A modified version of Wildshape including 4+ new forms is 100%     complete, except changes need to be made to the player file to allow     the spell to actually work.    Aura, an aura system-spell for Clerics, is 75% complete and the work     remaining is minor.    Mirror, an illusion spell for mages, is about 75% complete.  %^CYAN%^Non Combat%^RESET%^:     Water breathing, a spell designed to work with the underwater code,     is 100% complete.%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Help needed with%^RESET%^:Writing daemons. I have very little (if any) experience with writing daemons (apart from spells and abilities) and I need a basic daemon which I can work from to assist me. Some instructions on how to use/update/interact with it etc would be appreciated, like how to call functions on it from rooms and monsters and such.Some minor bugs which Daos can probably help me with. Need them for some parts of my area and spells and such."
