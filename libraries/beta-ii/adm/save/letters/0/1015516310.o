__Letter "I know you guys are busy, but could you please implement some type of stones/scrolls system?  It's ridiculous how much time you cut with gate.  Shouldn't the rest of the mud have almost the same ability?  But it won't be, since we will have to pay for the stones/scrolls (or whatever they are).  And teleport was AWESOME, it helped people out tons.  I remember you guys saying that it would be put back into the game. Thanks for all the great work. Marius"
