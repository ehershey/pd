__Letter "Well, we ran into a fun snag today, which took detach, myself and leviathas to finger out.Tendrick was coding up his guild room and was having a buncha code in the mapping system like what we had before, It took leviathas to finally figure out that his titles of: %^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^-%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^=%^RED%^[%^BOLD%^%^RED%^ Scarlet Knights Armoury %^RESET%^%^RED%^]%^ORANGE%^=%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^-\\n%^RESET%^-=[ Scarlet Knights Armoury ]=- (without color)Were screwing with the mapping system when they had color code in them. the characters of - and = and [ were messing with somehting that I dont know about in the mapping sys while color coded surrounded them and giving us some odd code in the room descrip with maps on.This is just a report to you on unforseen things, I dont know what you can do about it, but im asking tendrick to change his room titles for that purpose. Have fun finding the bug! lol"
