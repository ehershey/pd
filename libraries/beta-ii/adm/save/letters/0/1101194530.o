__Letter "Vlad is being denied his title back.  So we have been forwarded 600K gold to make life hell for members of Chosen.Palin, Vlad, and Tchon will be exempt from being killed as is agreed already.I have informed Vlad, Orcha, Palin, and other parties involved that I cannot declare war on Chosen, but that i will organize...effectively, guerilla tactics against them.  jumping them when they least expect it, waiting until we can do it again, and have someone else do it each time.--Also, we have to think a little...Tauran has left Unholy, and joined Chosen.  He's not planning to fight for them, and i can now slaughter him again.  however, i am planning to allow Orcha and other involved to deal with his deaths rather than having him pestering our still smaller minions and malefactors.--Thats all for the current update.  Just want you to know what im up to.  (Also, Nulvect i'll quote on saying \"hmm... that might be fun though\" ;)%^GREEN%^~*~%^BLACK%^BOLD%^Bellos d'Terrible - Glad to FINALLY be getting involved%^RESET%^GREEN%^~*~"
