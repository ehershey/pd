__Letter "Well, I am at it again *sigh* I hope this makes sense because I am full of questions and I would rather talk to you then go this route, but for some reason you know the right times to get off (ie when I get on :P )ANYway, you said I could have the quest on my place, which is no problem.  what I was wondering if it be okay for me to spread the quest the length of my area, meaning getting the stuff for the first part of the dragon quest.  The first part was just looking for 9 orbs ( I will be willing to cut it down to the main four dragon colors) and these orbs would open up a door within the mountain side. I will keep the next two parts of the dragon the same.  I will make sure that a level 1 would be able to reach these orbs, but the one main big problem is they would have to find a way to my place..ie gate, hitch a ride on a boat.If there is any problems with this, I need the specific problems you see, and I will try and accomadate whatever you feel I should do........ in the meantime I will just keep plugging away on my area (which by the way my marsh area has doubled, and have mobs...thank you very much) savelhahaha, forgot I was writing to you.Hep"
