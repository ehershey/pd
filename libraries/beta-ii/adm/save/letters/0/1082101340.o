__Letter "Everything about getting into the sandcastle is fine, assuming there's that message there. Except I think it would be better if you started out at the sandcastle's gates, near the drawbridge, since that is where you entered from (it says so in the desc of the sandcastle). This way the area flows a little better. The main hall room is very well described. I like. The fish bones are a great touch.Ok, after you go across the stairs from the main room, there's a line which reads: \"After climbing the stairs warily, amazed they did not break under your weight, you arrive upstairs.\" This is a powerplay, unfortunately; who's to say they're amazed? And, also, it has another problem. What if you come from the east, then you're not coming up the stairs, hey? So really, that should be reworded. The smell and sound messages here, along with the rest of the description, are all good however.The room to the west, which is the playroom \"West Upstairs\" is almost perfect. Very well done, although you may want to decapitalize Ocean. Aside from that, it's awesome.\"East Upstairs\" is almost as good, except that again it's got an assumption of entrance. \"You have gone east\"... is arkward here. Other then that, great.As you leave the sandcastle it should say that you grow bigger again. I also believe that this ladder is a little odd- I think it'd be better if you could leave out the same way you came in, through the castle's main gates. I think it'd really help the area flow better.The \"West Room\" to the west of the Grand Hall is awesome. Perfect. Again with the Ocean, but that's only a minor issue.The \"North West Room\" is awesome. I love it. Definately builds atmosphere.\"North East Room\" is great, but has a few things which could be better. \"You have entered the east front room...\" is redundant and arkward. Also, the use of the word \"too\" is a bit arkward, too. Maybe, instead of, \"Everything's darker in this room too, but not as foreboding.\" you could have something like, \"This room appears somewhat darker then other rooms in the castle, but somehow less foreboding.\" Aside from these things, this room is great.There's a typo in the \"East Room\", because it says that \"You have entered the east front room\", but the east front room is just to the north. The Dangerous Rubbish is a great touch here."
