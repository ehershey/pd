__Letter "Monk:Abil:	Attack:		multikick - the enhanced version of circlekick this abil would hit the opponent multiple times depending on skill level with each kick, im guessing a 30ish lvl abil		assail - this would be a series of quick punches that would hit at multiple times at the opponent (newbie abil - lvl 15: 1 hit, get one more hit with every 15 lvls)		heave/takedown - this abil would be a lvl 34ish abil used to slam the opponent to the ground and maybe paralyze him for a cpl rounds. (would para 1 round at lvl 34 with at least 78 wis and go up from there with a MAX of 3 rounds) *a note on heave/takedown* if heave is being used it should also have a 50/50 chance to take the opponent out to the next room to give the monk a breather or chance to regain stamina		fury - this abil would be the monks own type of rage to use a series of multiple kicks and punches in a combo to finish the opponent would prolly take in multikick/assail in it almost like the berserker rage	Defense:	Weapon:	Deception:	Other:Spells:	Attack:	Defense:		meditate - this abil would be used to keep the 	opponent aware of his opponent and dodge his abils/spell in the process (like a parry)	Faith:	Healing:  		chakra - regain sp can only use it every X seconds/minutes	Conjuring:	Other:"
