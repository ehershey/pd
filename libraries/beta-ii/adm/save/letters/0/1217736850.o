__Letter "I think we can make it work. What we're going to need is a function that you can query to see if the mob is flying (or in the air), which I think may already exist. What we will need next is some way to query what their coordinates are in the sky. Then, we can just add a variable in the monster code that keeps track of the coordinates that wandering mob is allowed to fly to when in the air (or 4 coordinates for the 4 corners if you want it to be a square), then edit the current wandering code (which I believe may work on heartbeats or call_outs) so that it works as already outlined if the monster is on the ground, but picks north,east,south, or west randomly and then flies in that direction as long as it would not take them out of the area they are allowed to fly in.(that's on making pathing flying mobs)"
