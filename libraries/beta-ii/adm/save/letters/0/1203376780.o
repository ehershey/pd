__Letter "I had a good day, love. My talk with you helped ease my mind immensely. After you went to sleep, I had a lil tender moment with Null, my friend Matt. I told him thanks for being my friend all this time. And he was all like 'what am I supposed to say ta that?' I was like you're welcome? But I hadda say 'No Homo!' to stress it was healthy manlove. :) Then, I went uypstairs, had a good long pray. After that, slept so good in just 4 hours, it was amazing. Gonna go down for a nap now. See you later tonight, mebbe! Itadakimasu will be back.P.S. My mom said hi!Love,James"
