__Letter "What im saying is that we need a way to link to the builders portfrom the website like we do for the main site. I would limit itto people that have an existing character on the builders port asa security measure tho.This way just anybody cant log on and make a mortal. There isntmuch that person could do but walk around TIrun anyways under my securyt system but still.What im saying is a link so that we can use the java server to linkto builders like we do port 5000.Ironman"
