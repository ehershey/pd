__Letter "I'm glad you and your car were ok in the accident.  Did you have to wait for police and everything?  *nods*  I remember you saying you were going to be gone for about a week.  *sighs*  I miss you a lot, and I havent really been able to chat with you the past two days.  And then you'll be gone for a week.  Soooo..  I don't have any plans tomorrow, so I'll be on tomorrow afternoon/evening/night for whenever you get on.  Looking forward to talking to you again.                                      -Paul"
