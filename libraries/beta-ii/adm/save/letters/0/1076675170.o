__Letter "I'm sure you get bothered about this all the time, but I was thinking and, I've thought about this for a while...I'd love it if there was a 'who -l' and 'who deed(s)' to sort the who list in order of (who -l) how many languages a person is fluent in, and (who deeds) how many deeds a player has done. i realize this isn't really a crucial command, but i'd love to see it happen, maybe you could pitch the idea to someone else, if you're not interested in coding it (too busy or whatnot). anyway, i gotta get going, i hope that you're doing better than the last time we spoke. remember what i said about everything. *hug*take care,jen"
