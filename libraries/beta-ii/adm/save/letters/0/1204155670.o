__Letter "Hello, love. Sorry I missed you. Gonna take a lil nap before workso I can kick butt tonight. :D If I can, I will take my break anhour earlier than usual so I can maybe catch you before bedtime.I hope you feel less tired and maybe do some fun stuffs to boostup the energy. :) Maybe I can arrange a nice, fun dream involvingme and a certain sweet lady. :) I can hope, anyways! (My dreamsare remarkably tame tho, usually) Ok, off to Sleepyville!Love,JamesP.S. - I plan to be on as Uzamaki later"
