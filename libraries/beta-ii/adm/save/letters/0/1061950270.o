__Letter "This is just a little further information, on the wiz thing. The other night wiz had noa and yakko in his workroom with a whole stern of auction items on the ground, gotta love scry hehe. they were probably playing with them i guess including the one where a death is ignored, because yakko died in his workroom, sure they were only playing around, but this is a little of admin interference to a slightly greater degree.p.s Don't suppose any auction items are still available :) especially armour of some sort.~ty"
