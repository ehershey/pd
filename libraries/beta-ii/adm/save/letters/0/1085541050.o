__Letter "After a short talk with Stormbringer, a period of consideration and self-reflection and re-reading of the log of you and I speaking on builders port I have come to the conclusion that my behaviour during that chat, despite the heated environment, was unprofessional and sloppy. As I said earlier Immortals are held to higher standards then players- and as such I was wrong to swear and loose my temper even in what I considered a private conversation. You did not deserve such and it shouldn't be expected from me or any other immortal and as such you deserve my sincere apologies.I was also advised in the future protocol for adding items to the game, to prevent this happening again- anything which has not been checked over by an admin and which I have not been told directly by an admin to add (in person- information relayed by players does not count) or code which does not run or is clearly unbalanced is not to be added to the mud, period. While this may lead to considerable delays in some things, with our revitalized staff base hopefully this should be less of a problem and should avoid the sorts of dramas we've had recently.Again, please accept my apoligies- I was out of line in that regard.--Ven."
