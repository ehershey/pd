__Letter "hey stormy,i know these things are iffy, but i was wondering if mortis can have her old necromancer restored.  she cided during some hard times and came back to pd but doesn't show up much. i think if she had her necro back she would be happy and show her face more often.  can we call it an voluntary temp arrest or sumfin :)for meeeeeeeeeee even tho i dont deserve it :P"
