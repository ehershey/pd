__Letter "Not sure if I am buggy. Before I remorted I didnt have any sapphires rings then I remorted and I had the 6 I had yesterday from previous remort. Then I stock up with oils (80) and head out and I have no oils and my 2 diamonds are gone. Also is it normal for corona list to erase during remorts?"
