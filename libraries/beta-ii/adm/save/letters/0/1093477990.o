__Letter "I've done a clean up of the Illuminati members list. Anyone that I have not seen online in the past 2-3 months has been removed, unless I know that you have an active alt that you are playing. You are free to join again, you just have to talk to me, Blits, or Aziraphale and we will be glad to induct you. Scourge"
