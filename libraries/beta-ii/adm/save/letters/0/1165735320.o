__Letter "Its been a fun-filled nine years of running and supporting the online game development and player community. However after some recent DDOS and ssh/ftp attacks, hardware failures, software upgrade errors and the recent passing of my older brother to cancer, it has become apparent when its time to just cut one's losses and throw in the towel.MultiUser RolePlay Entertainment and its hosting services would not have lasted as long as it had without the support from everyone including TopMudSites, Mud Magic, Electric Soup and The MudConnector and its patrons for keeping the MU* hosting community alive all these years.  Farewell my friends. Farewell."
