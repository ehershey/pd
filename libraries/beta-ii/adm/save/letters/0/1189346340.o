__Letter "I need to ask a favor of you.Can you come read over the tutorial files i have done onthe builders port ??I want you to do it cause i want to make sure that someone withlittle experiance with LPC can understand what im trying to showin these files. No offense to you but you told me you werent asadvanced as the other admins so i figure your the best optionfor what i need here. I want the files to be clear to the pointthat the layman can build by reading them.They are contained in the /doc/coding directory and it's subdirectories. Mail back to me on the builders port if/whenyou see anything that is confusing to you and i'll rewrite thefile(s).The command called \"coding\" will read anything in this directory."
