__Letter "I was thinking of building an area, and this area will be unlike any otherMy idea is to start a band of villies, and walk them through some ages, like nomadic to bronze age.I wanted to implement a ratio count system that keeps track of the tribe and givena set # of elders vs adults or elders vs teenagers will cause the villies to do different things and carry differnet toolsI would also like to set them up and a time system to upgrade their wepaons if they encounter a mob holding a weapon of greater valuehit me back."
