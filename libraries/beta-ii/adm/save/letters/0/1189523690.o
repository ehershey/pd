__Letter "IntroductionThe intention of the mapper is that you can use it to generate a speed walk string (for use in an alias), by \"teaching\" it the way to go, rather than having to record each move you make on a bit of paper. For example, you might start at the city square, and walk around until you find a grocery shop, and then record the steps needed to find it, so you can find it again next time more easily. Also, by generating the reverse steps, you could move back from the grocery shop to the city square very easily.This is not a GUI mapper (in other words, it doesn't attempt to draw maps on the screen), but is a system for recording the steps you have taken, with a view to re-using them later.Once activated, it will do the following:Automatically record \"standard\" compass directions These are defined as:  n (north), s (south), e (east), w (west), ne, se, nw, sw, u (up) and d (down)   The directions in brackets are synomyms - either may be used.Record other commandsOn request, record any other commands which move you around, eg. \"teleport\", \"go portal\", \"open door\", \"unlock gate\". You can use Mapper special command to do this.Record commentsTo help work out where the mapping sequence is you can add comments manually (eg. \"Outside Darkhaven\"). Also, on an MXP-enabled MUD MUSHclient will automatically add room names to the auto-map sequence.Detect movement failureAutomatically detect when a direction command fails to move you, and remove the failed direction from the mapping list. This is done by matching on a user-supplied \"failure\" string, eg. \"Alas, you cannot go that way\", \"You cannot go north\", \"The gate is locked\", \"The door is closed\". The failure string can be a \"regular expression\", thus combinations of the above may be expressed, eg. ^(You cannot go that way|The gate is locked)$ Remove backtrackingAutomatically (if desired) remove backtracking. For example, if you go North, and then South, you would normally end up back where you started. The auto-mapper will remove such instances, so that the end \"direction string\" does not contain false starts.Produce a speedwalk stringConvert the recorded directions into a \"speedwalk string\".Produce a reverse speedwalkAlso provide a \"reverse speedwalk\", so you can go back the way you came.Make a forwards and backwards aliasOn request, turn the direction string into an alias. Ditto for the reverse direction.Review your progressYou can review the recorded steps at any point, and either keep adding to them, or start a new pathway.Correct mistakesIf you accidentally record a direction that wasn't taken, it can be removed from the mapping sequence.Take the reverse routeYou can take the reverse route by clicking a single button."
