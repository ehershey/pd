__Letter "since the 3 of us are at the helm, i think one way of selecting sadists would be to each pick one. either that or we could narrow it down to 5 or so candidates and rank them 1-5 and see what we come up with. but since there aren't any more sadists currently, i say we fill the positions sooner than later.mail me back and if you have any other ideas as far as choosing sadists, i'm definitly open to hear them.think that's itsmokey rules"
