__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Ashram to Yakko Sat Jul  6 13:04:07 2002:-----KK here are my thoughts. Druss told me before he was putting an alt into illuminati as a spy. He told me all about their guild including what items they had, their members, their treasury, who had alts and what the alts names were.When i get information about who artanis's alts have been (wedge, prometheus, elathius, azbigal) it has always been from druss. he checks em out and asks around with those guys to find out and tell me. artanis's alts always exp when i'm on which leads me to believe that they dont know that i know who they are (they hide when the know that i relalize they are artanis).I'd say druss is fine and i think that he's spying for us not the illuminati. Illuminati members that i can think of off hand.  Halo (leader). Gab (council), Loki (council), Azire (council). Halogen (halo's alt). Azbigal (artanis). Kilir (Aximili). And a few other small people most who are non-hm or level 20s. Aziraphale watches out for them i'm possitive. All in all the only member of their guild i have a problem with is azbigal and he will be killed as soon as he exps. He doesnt know who i am because he exps when i am on. this leads me more to believe than druss/emilon is on our side.Just my thoughts. What else have you guys noticed?"
