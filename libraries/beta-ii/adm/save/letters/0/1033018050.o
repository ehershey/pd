__Letter "Well, I've got some good news...  and a question *grin*  Turns out that this friday there's an inauguration ceremony for the new university president.  Consequesntly, all of my professors have canceled class that day.  I hadnt realized until just now because I thought I still had a class.  Anyway, on to my question...  Since I've got a 3 day weekend, I'd love to come up to visit.  I'll understand if it's not possible.  It is really late notice, and you're not feeling well.  If I could use your shower, I would be more than happy to sleep in my car if it meant I could see you again.  I know there's a lot of things working against me, but a guy can dream, eh?  *smiles and kisses you*  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  *hugs you tightly*                                     Love,                                       Your Paul"
