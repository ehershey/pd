__Letter "Alright...  I know you've got some coding ability so I dont have a problem with you working on bugs, as well as doing QC.  As I'm sure you noticed while playing, there are a lot of items that have poorly made ids, as well as typos.  There are a few things that I'm going to ask you to leave to either stormy whit or I.  Things that have to do with ability/spell damage or balance should be left...  Stormy gets touchy when anyone changes his balance.  If players have a problem, feel free to help them out, but I'd like you to avoid compensation for xp, stats and levels.  I'm glad you want to join us again :)                     -Nightshade"
