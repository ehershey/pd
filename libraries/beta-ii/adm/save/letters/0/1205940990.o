__Letter "I need your help and advice here.I want to bring in more builders for PD. Two things here tho.Either, I wish to post on the main board or move the contructionboard to a more public location. I want the general populationto be able to FIND this board else it defeats the purpose ofhaving it. If you wish not to move it, then i want to post onthe main tirun board to solicit builders for us. Perferably, Iwould like it to be just south of the main TIrun board.Second issue. I have other people whom have worked with me in the past on other muds. I would like to bring them to work for you here.Wanted your blessing on this before i offer this to them. This isyour house and i wish to be respectful of it before i bring inoutside sources to help us.Please mail me back on these issues.Ironman"
