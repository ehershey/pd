__Letter "*laughs* wow, that is pretty suprising. *sigh* unfortunately, things are not going as well on my end. Things with the divorce are escalating quickly, and my parents are not suffering any of my fiendish schemes at the moment. With the way things are here at home at the moment, i'll probably be basically LIVING with Mayuki and Celeste until we move into our apartment in the Twin Cities. oi. I didn't know how good i had things. well, i guess that's why there's a song about it. 'dont know what you've got til its gone' . I'm going to be home tomorrow , so i'll be on here, i really do hope i see you. I miss you, whether you believe it or not, i really do. *hug*"
