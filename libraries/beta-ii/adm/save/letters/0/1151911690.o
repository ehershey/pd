__Letter "Hello, sir. Mudmailing you as per your instructions. As you know, someimmortals have recently quit. There were a couple recent suicides. Well,the guy who plays Arma was over at Vayne's house and created Nesoo. Asa result, Vayne's IP address has been banned from making new characters.I was hoping this ban could be lifted. Vayne follows the rules far morethan most around here, I believe, and I don't think you would regretshowing a kindness in this situation. Any consideration you give ismuch appreciated. Thanks.Also, Arma was arrested for going lindead with one alt then logging onanother. Now, I have never been a fan of just such a maneuver but I doknow it is done with great frequency around these parts. He also has ahistory of infractions with swearing on lines and such. He is a decentguy but does have some anger issues. He thinks before he acts at times.Also, he did make the Nesoo character but I believe he said he saw nothing in writing saying he couldn't. Not that that is a valid excuse.My apologies for so long a bending of your ear.I leave the outcome in your more than capable hands.Sincerely,Escobar"
