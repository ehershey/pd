__Letter "Ricket is Bonnie/Orcha/my friend Nate in Australia.Not sure who Zeafai is. I hope everything goes well this weekend.I didnt know you werent back on because I wasnt back on. I wasfeeling a little bummed. Not just missing you but not wanting tosay how sometimes I feel a bit sad at how we hardly ever 'talk talk'and it feels almost like I'm trying to bully you into getting a phone number and giving it to me. I love you very much but I don't wanna sound like a bully orsound desperate. It just seems like the progress we make ispainfully slow sometimes. I'll get over all this soon. Please dontfeel bad. Part of me wants to erase this message before it getsto you. But I want you to know me, inside and out, good and maybenot quite-so-good. Talk to you later, love.All my love,Your James"
