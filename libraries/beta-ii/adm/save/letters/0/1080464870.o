__Letter "Im leaving pd for a while, ciding wraith actually, because of the immortals inability to quiet one person from harassment.If you are going to wield the power of immortal then you should wield it wisely, know when the time is to put your foot down and when the time for lienency is. Im tored of being harassed by players just because im Wraith.This mail was mainly geared twards daos and helena, Nightshade, there is a log of most of the harassment in the logs, I couldnt get the stuff off newbie though."
