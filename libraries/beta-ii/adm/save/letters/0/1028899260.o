__Letter "Dude... Some freaking bug in the arena caused the game to give me a pk flag for killing Ashram in the arena. So when I went to the square I was hauled off and executed. Luckily, Faust got my stuff so I got that back. But I still have the problem of dieing due to a fucking bug.  Wraith gave me my three levels back, but refused to give me the 20 million in stats and skills I lost.  His explanation, \"Shit happens\" Yeah, fuck you too, asshole.So now I gotta spend a few hours getting my shit back up when it wasn't even my fault that this happened!The ONLY positive thing about this is now I got Ashram on my kill list, hehe.-Nate"
