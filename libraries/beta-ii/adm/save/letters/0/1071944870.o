__Letter "\"I am an unusual thing; I have no soul and no body; one cannot see me but can hear me; I do not exist for myself; only a human being can give me life, as often as he wishes; and my life is only of short duration, for i die almost at the moment in which I am born. And so, in accordance with men's caprice, I may live and die untold times a day. To those who give me life I do nothing - but those on whose account I am born I leave with painful sensations for the short duration of my life until I depart. Whatever passions a man finds himself in at the time when he grants me life I will surely bring those along into the world. For the most part, women produce me gently and and amiably; many have modestly confessed their love in this way. Many have also saved their virtue through me; in these cases, however, my life can scarcely endure a quarter of an hour. I must come into the world by a singular stroke of fortune: otherwise there is no outlet - the man is deformed. (A fart)"
