__Letter "I thought I should just let you know that I think rubicante is targetting other kataans, he has been sending his little assassins after me quiet often, and I consider this annoyance a form of harrassment. I'm one of the only active(semi) kataans, and I'm sure there will be more, and I believe if he is allowed to kill them at will, there will be problems. I don't feel anything should be done to him, as of yet, although I do find his actions quite dis-honarable, to me and to many, I wanted to just ask you to keep a close eye on him. I find his methods questionable at best."
