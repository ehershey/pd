__Letter "Hey,Tried to call you and got your voice mail. My home number is 903-566-7727, give me a call or email me back. I need to know domain name, kind of website, what kind of help you need. I charge $10 a month for hosting plus domain fees which I think is around $7 a year, so it would run you around $127 a year to host a website on the server. If you need help building the website we can work out something that will be beneficial to both of us. Let me know.Tommyweb site = 30-50 bucks"
