__Letter "Ok i've talked to Paul about it more and we've come to the conclusion it's more like.  You reply to Nightshade: i feel like i'm making you think i'm a love sick jealous loony, it's not that at all...i wish i could explain it. i guess i feel how someone feels when there bestfriend gets a boyfriend. Nightshade tells you: well, because we were always there for each other, it kept you from becoming close with other people on the mud. Nightshade tells you: I'm sorry about that thing with wraith on here, I should have just minded my own business.  You reply to Nightshade: i know i'm being selfish. Nightshade tells you: I can understand that, because the time I can manage online will be taken up by someone else.  You reply to Nightshade: i want you to be happy and i feel like i'm throwing a tantrum because i can't get my own way.  Nightshade tells you: I would miss you too if you got together with someone, but I would be happy for you. You tell Nightshade: this shouldn't be effecting me as much as it is, we haven't had alot of time together for ages and yes i miss you but haven't gone off, so why should it be different now. Nightshade tells you: maybe because it's just a little more official this way.On Merentha we would party for hours a day and we did that for about 18 mths, it's not like it was just a quick fling of a friendship.  We help each other a through a heap of stuff.I just thought i would explainWisp"
