__Letter "KK. Monks at 20 are looking pretty good.  Crushingblow is a nice opener or stun touch, depending on the player's preference.Circle kick and snap kick are the dominant moves at this level. They kill at the rate of a fighter this level which is good balance.Supplication and iron skin are both niceMy furystrike still does very little damage but i assume that gets better later on like bladedance which is also weak till lvl 37 or soIf you could please set me to lvl 37 with 50s in stats and max skills i'll keep checking out monks at that level.Thx! Monks are looking pretty good"
