__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Hepualahaole to Hepualahaole Sat Sep 13 22:41:22 2003:-----Roses of love spreads her arms to embrace the morning sun.  She whispers a tale, of how the moon has cried all through the night.  The earth has felt the pain and erupted into flames, sending forth an army to wake the ocean.  Forcing it to rise and confort the moon.Roses of love (red)Morning sun (yellow)moon (white)cried = dew drops (cyan)night (black)earth (green)flames (orange)sending forth an army = lava (magenta)ocean (blue)I know, it's not a poem, it's more like a lil story...."
