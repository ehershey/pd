__Letter "Daboura,I have been asked by Daos today if he was allowed to have a player character.  I told him that you had the final say, but my opinion was that immortal possession of mortal characters should either be for testing or for part of our RP event.  We should be in complete control of how such characters impact the game, which we aren't really if they're just players.Just a heads up.  If he asks you, I wanted you to be able to think of it ahead of time.Levi"
