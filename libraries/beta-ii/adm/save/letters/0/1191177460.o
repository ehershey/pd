__Letter "Ok, I was reading the board and I saw a post about getting arrested characters back. I've been good now for over a month and I've worked really hard. I was wondering if you could possibly give me my suicided characters back. Their names are Arma and Kilik. If you can give me either back that would be really cool. If not I'll understand. Been working hard to get Noxus strong but if I remember correctly both those characters were demons and I really want a demon for this one class that I want to play. From what I can tell demons are shut down now and I can't be one that's the only reason I'm asking for my characters back.Thanks for your time - Noxus"
