__Letter "I was thinking of creating a player-tester setting for the builders'port. I wanted to get the administrations blessing on that one beforei offered it to anyone tho.Basically, the post would be for players to preview a builder's stuff.This would of course require the builder to grant the p-tester \"guest\"status under my security screens. The guest status would allow/blockaccess for the p-tester just like it does builders.I think this would be benificial for builders to get feedback onoccasion from a player. It would be totally up to the builders whohas access and when. The p-testers would have to answer to the builder(s)that asked them to work with them as well as the staff on builders.Ironman"
