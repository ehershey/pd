__Letter "I guess ya cant have it all. :( Also, I am sorry I didn't mail youthis morning. I was drained!! So tired, I didnt even log back intoany mud. I hope you slept well. Today is one of my class days so Imight not see much of you again today. :( But, I will hope. :) Takecare and try to have some fun sometime today, my love. :)Love,James"
