__Letter "hey bro hate to be dramatic or anything but as long as sugar is a leader in unholy, when pk is back I will be actively offing her until she steps down :) and/or anyone who disagrees. I think you deserved a promotion before her... and its demoralizing that she is a guild leader. I told her the only way to make unholy right again is to promote you to leader then step down "
