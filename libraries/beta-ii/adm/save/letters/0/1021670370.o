__Letter "    Hi Stormbringer this is Eios and as you requested here the attached file is all the coding for the guild. I'm sorry if there are any mistakes in the code but I am not the worlds best coder and have done my best. The total amount is 11000000 gold and that is for:**New Guild (500000)**Sub-hall and portal (300000+100000)**Oil/stone shop (200000)     The name of the guild is 'Acheron' If the entrance to the main hall could be located 3n,w from tirun [] with a hidden exit 'push stone'. Also with the sub hall I would like it 2sw,s from the main tent in Merkkirri, There is no south exit and could you please make it so that only guild members can get into that hall.  I would also like all the rooms in the guild to be safe rooms. If this cannot be done then i'd like them no-bump and no-teleport.  Once the guild is in can you please set me and Artanis to guild leader, but for when people type 'help guilds' and it shows the main leader can you please put my name there. Thanks for your time.                                Eios.*** Entrance ***#include <std.h>inherit ROOM;void create() {  ::create();    set_short(\"Entrance of Acheron\");    set_long(\"Welcome to the entrance of Acheron.
