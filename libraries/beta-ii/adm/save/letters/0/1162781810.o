__Letter "heart_beat is called by the driver automatically.call_outs are called by the driver automatically.The list of objects with heart_beats is probably just an array.The list of objects with pending call_outs is an array of mappings,or in the C it's coded in, an array of a fairly complex struct.I've read that having a couple hundred call_outs pending can severelylag the mud.I've seen personally that badly coded heart_beats OR call_outs cancause errors.All in all, I am for heart_beat in objects and important daemons,and only using call_out in some commands and special circumstances."
