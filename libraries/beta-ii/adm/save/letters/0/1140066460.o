__Letter "Alan is a fugue in black. Everything about him is orchestrated for stealth, right down to the precise way his boots are laced up over his calves to prevent his trousers from shifting and attracting attention. The rest of his clothes are also worn close and cover his skin so that only his hands and face show. He watches you for a moment, contemplatively stroking the black-wrapped hilt of a dagger. An enigmatic smile hovers at the corners of his lips before he turns and simply walks away. Not even the sound of retreating footsteps betrays that he was ever there.Edit as needed. It was hard to do sexy AND standoffish. :P"
