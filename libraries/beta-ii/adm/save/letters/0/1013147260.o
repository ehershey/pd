__Letter "I have an idea for the Forsaken guild i'd like done if its possible. It would be to have to room with the pool (i emailed you about the room with the pool) and the pool could be used to \"view person\" which would work like that spell scry. If this is doable let me know. I can pay for it whatever it costsAlso dont worry about moving the guild to Dryfus. I'll just bring Ashram back to being active again since he was the founder :) Thanks man-- Ashram the Black Knight"
