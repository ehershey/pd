__Letter "I'd post this on the Angel board. But I don't want soulfly to know I am 50 and Gabriel would go spastic if he knew. And you did say to send a mail.godspeed aziraphaleAfter doing a little bit of testing I can see that holyfire checks for who it will hit when it is first casted. When fighting multiple enemies, if one of them dies, it won't die until after you start casting the spell. So when the spell hits you get an error.It bugs up in a particular way. What happens is that it cycles through all the mobs to be hit. When it gets to the mob that died then you get code spam and any mobs to be hit after that, aren't.When a mob dies you will get the code spam twice. Once for the round that it hits (Casted before the mob dies). And once the next round, since the dead mob is still on the 'to hit' list the round it dies.Also, if you cast holyfire on a player, and then they move out of the room, they will still be hit by holyfire.Finally, if there isn't anything in the room you can still cast it. This wouldn't be bad if it still hit anyone that entered and started killing you.Suggestions:Holyfire decides who to hit the second round rahter than the first. So it will hit people who enter and attack you.A little more damage would be nice. It is the elite move of an elite quest race and it does a little bit less damage than my slash. Other elite moves do over 1k damage. I know my skills and stats aren't brilliant, but still.Oh, I almost forgot, sometimes the timing stuffs up. It also happens for heartstones, and oils too I guess. Sometimes they take a round or two longer to work than they should.That is all I can think of for the moment. Any questions just bug me until I answer.	- Aziraphale"
