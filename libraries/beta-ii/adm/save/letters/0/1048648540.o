__Letter "I dont know what we started arguing about.. and at this point.. i dont really care.. yesterday before our game my softball coach was riding back to the school building on a four-wheeler when she took a turn to fast and flipped.  She hit her head and by the time Tara(our pitcher and my friend) and myself got to her she was in a state of shock, having seziures and had lost all forms of conscious comunication.  We called 911 and within 15 minutes the ambulance showed up.. but they couldnt help her.. so they called a helicopter to come in and fly her to the nearest hospital.. she has a bruise on her brain and they are watching her for swelling which may cause damage.  Yesterday they couldnt even tell us if she was going to live.  I spent most of last night staring into darkness as the entire scene replayed over in my head.. i've been crying since then and though she is going to be ok (she's not out of the woods yet.. but she's coming along miraculously) myself and our team have had a rough day.. i know you probably dont want to hear all this.. but i had to takl to someone.. and this is the first time i could discuss it without busting out into tearsits probably the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me.. tara and i got to her.. and a man told tara to go find the nurse.. this other woman (a nurse) came over and told me and another lady to help her roll coach onto her side.. i had to hold her there as she spasmed and contorted.. blood pouring from her head and seeing her legs, arms, and stomach ripped up.. I couldnt take it.. today has been even worse.. every time i close my eyes i see it all happen again.. i've had to leave two classes because i was crying.. only to find my other team-mates (who i'm supposed to be strong for) crying along side me.  im emotionally brokenwhatever we were fighting for.. im sorry.. if you want to keep fighting just.. wait another couple of days.. please.. i cant handle anymore stress.. im sorryme"
