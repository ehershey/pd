__Letter "Look, I wasn't being overly sensitive. First of all, I was being teamed up against by 3 people. Does that thought not even cross your mind at all? Mazrim has done this before to another real life friend of mine, and mazrim is supposed to be a good friend, he knew evolution was a good rl friend of mine, yet he stasis' a room in lodos and blah blah blah. Yes, I admit I shouldn't have dragged it on, but at the same time you cannot deny the fact that I was being egged on by people, Luck being the main one. They had NO say in this matter whatsoever, they were purposely trying to keep me going, which isn't the first time. Do you have any idea how it feels when everyone is teaming up against you, and when the one person who is SUPPOSED to be a good friend you think is about to defend you instead smacks you down, and doesn't bother smacking down any of the other people?How can you not see that what you did was really inconsiderate and hurtful? It takes more than one person to argue. I wasn't alone in that. Mazrim said things like cry me a river and stfu, and luck was the same. They were just as immature if not more, than I was being, and instead of telling them to stop, you only told me to. Being a good friend, I don't see how you could do that. Or even being a good imm. A good imm would be JUST/fair not unfair. You singled me out, just like they were. I'm not alone in thinking this, I've talked to a couple other people and they saw it too. I was being verbally attacked, it became 4 against 1. I can't believe that after all the time and thought that I've invested into a friendship with you, that you'd be this way, so inconsiderate and so not understanding. I thought I meant a little more to you than this. Bye.-jen"
