__Letter "aI wanted to streamline the building process. The procedure wouldbe as follows;    1) They apply with Daos, Nulvect or myself.    2) LAW reviews their history and tells if we can trust them.    3) One of us sets up their builder.    4) I take them under my wing and show them the LPC ropes.    5) Project completed and submitted for review.===============================================================                  Review process ===============================================================     1) I review the area for function. I make sure the code        does what the builder wants it to do. I would also        be searching for errors like things where a person        is moved into a room when no one in the room is told.     2) Second review by a content review. They would check        for spelling, grammer, balance, etc.     3) Repairs from steps 1 and 2 are done.     4) Area sent to be reviewed by Daos and/or another staff        member.     5) Repairs from steps 4 are done.     6) Area brought to stormbringer or luna for their stamp        of approval.     7) Any changes needed are done and the area is exported        for the main port.=============================================================The whole point of this would be to streamline the buildingprocess so it doesn't take months to get a completed area intothe mud."
