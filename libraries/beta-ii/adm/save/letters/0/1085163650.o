__Letter "Alright. I'm not gonna drag this on further. I haven't made any insinuations in this mudmail or in the apology. I don't know why you think that I did, but I didn't. I haven't said anything in the past that I feel is cruel, besides what I say to regular players. Anything I've said to immortals, I felt wasn't insulting, or cruel. I don't insinuate anything when I mail you, or talk to anyone really, if you're inferring things, then that is your own business, I can't control that. I'd like to know what rules I have bent, and what words I've manipulated, and what people I \"pit\" against eachother. Please. (That's a serious request)As for CCing all of this over, I already assumed you would, and I'm glad you did, although I'm sure no one really wants to read any of this. It's just dragging it on further.My only real intention in continuing to communicate with you is to get rid of the conflict that we seem to have, to relieve the stress and drama that we've been having because of it.If you really want to hold onto any grudge you have, then fine, I won't argue it, and of course I'll leave you alone, as I pretty much always have. But \"IMO\" it's better to have positive feelings toward someone, than negative ones.I won't send you anymore mudmails, so I'll let you have the last word in this.Take care,Kumi"
