__Letter "This is exactly like the buddy system, only difference it showsyou who your enemies are, when they sign on/sign off/linkdead.  Iused the color red for enemies and cyan for buddies.  I had to make changes to several files all in my dir.. _last.c, last_d.c,chat.c, and user.cIt's ready for you to look over."
