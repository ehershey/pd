__Letter "First of all, thanks for the changes you are doing.Secondly, im wondering if you can look at a possible reduction in sp cost of breathe, or even if its possible to allow red dragons to have some kind of natural sp regeneration that would make an impact. Im thinking of dragon fiction where the fighter dragons are able to constantly stay in battle for days (obviously that wont be happening in this mud), but something like a natural (Dexterity or Constitution/10)sp regen per round would be good or something like that. It's just ive found that if i use breathe in FF, in about 4 rounds i will have used something like 600sp, then ill need to spend another 6 rounds to get it back, so basically over half of the time will be spent using ointments. I just think this may be something different, since a lot of the abilities such as claw, bite and tailspear do exactly the same thing, but just different damages. Thanks"
