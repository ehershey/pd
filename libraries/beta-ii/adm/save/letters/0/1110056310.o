__Letter "I'd be interested in doing that.  I'd still be in the fight for Asmodeus though.  He blessed me with this weapon of a body, so he is still my god.Though..your loyalties could lie with the Lord as well im sure. aye ;)(Plus, i could drag important members into it as underlings...Our Bar Brawlers)Definately something to think about though.  I'd be the opposite of the Boondock Saints though :p i kill good, and spread evil :D"
