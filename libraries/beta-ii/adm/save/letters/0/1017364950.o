__Letter "Dude, why dont you go bother some other people? We REALLY dont care what merentha has and what it doesnt have.Also, mud bashing is not allowed on public lines/boards, so if you have a problem with anything in this mud just mudmail it, dont post it for everyone to read like thatAnd if you are Petrarch, all this is getting REALLY old, so just stop all of it, stop bashing us, stop coming to our mud and leaving comments like that on our boards. It just makes you look like a smaller insecure person in our eyes. Be mature and manage YOUR mud without disturbing ours. Peace."
