__Letter "Good. I got ALOT to go over now. It's been stockpiling fora few months now :(I have to go over the following issues at least;   1) Teach you how my security system functions on builders.      You need to know how to manipulate the settings to your      tastes. I also want to know if there are any modifications      you would want done.   2) Need whit or you to lend a hand helping me to fix the      snooping system. I want it to cut any snooping on a person      if they leave the party. Only way it wouldnt get cut is      if the snooper is an arch or admin. Right now it bars the      snoop if your not in the party BUT will let an active one      keep going if the snoopee leaves the party.   3) Want to go over the tutorials i have written up so far.      I've written up some quite extensive coding tutorials for      the builders. I even covered the subprocessor, qualifiers      and logical switches (aka the ?: statements). I want to      see if they are understandable to others :P I mailed luna      asking her to read them but havent gotten an answer.      For my purposes, It would probably be better for her to      read them and tell me if she can follow them. I want to      know a person who isnt use to LPC coding can follow what      i was trying to explain.    4) I want to talk to you about how the reviewing process       should work on builders. I am intending on dealing with       the technical end of the projects. Helping the builders       to get their projects functional. Once they're working       it would go to whomever would be reviewing for content.       My other role would be quests. I would teach the builders       how to construct safeguards for their quests the way i       have on my quests.    5) We need someone to consitantly be open for reviews. The       builders need to know that their projects will be looked       at in a timely manner. I suck at spelling and grammer or       i would do this part as well. It shouldnt take months or       years to get a project in. We need to streamline this       process.         a) Project submitted for review.         b) I review for content and make sure the objects work            the way they are ment to. In other works, I debug            the area and make sure quests are secured.                  c) Content reviewer steps in and makes sure the            descriptions, settings and everything are fine.         d) Comes to you, whit, or nulvect for final review once            they fixed anything we tell them to fix.         e) They fix anything you folks say to fix and it's            run thru steps b to d again.         f) Once it passed a second time. It's slated for entry            into the main port.     6) I'm currently working on the sfuns. I coded a command        to compare the tutorials contained in /doc and those        contained in simul_efun.c and there were alot missing.        I currently weeding thru them to see what is missing        and why. The command called _checkem.c in my cmds dir        is the command that does the comparison if you wish to        look.     7) Is there an object within the mud that contains the        efuns ?? Can i use functions() on something to get a        listing for them ?? If not, can you provide me a listing        from out of the shell ??        Im intending on doing efuns after sfuns.==================================================================One major thing i would ask tho if you are willing to let me bea staff member. Let me be able to grab updated copies of filesfor the builders port. I want to bring it up to date with themain port. ( We still have the firebomb command that used boozeover there...... ) Once the port is up to date, I can deal withthe lfuns as well. Pointless to try until the mudlib is updated.Main thing is that the builders need the new commands thatNulvect is coding. They need to be able to make their monstersuse them....IronmanPS -- Mail me a day ahead of time as to when you wish to meet so      im paying attention to gmud. Im usually writting the files      off-mud in a text editor so i might be idle for periods of      time. You can always IM my yahoo SN tho. Ironman9z."
