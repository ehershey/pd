__Letter "The room code is set up at the moment so that no one else can enter your room. Each room is private to whoever wants it. I can make it so that multiple people can share the same room. Also, all rooms would be accessed from within the class halls in the tower, so whatever calls the character is, you get in from that class hall. All class halls will be on the fifth floor.So, want it so that anyone and everyone can get into your room? Or that it is private?Note the rooms are all no scry etc, and you can start in them, so thy kind of function as a 'home base' or safe zone to idle in when you aren't learning languages.That means the treasure chest doesn't need code to be only usable by you, as only you can get to it.The donation thing wouldn't work, and what do you want a scry pool for, that char is a wizard."
