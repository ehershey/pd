__Letter "what do you mean who told dimi about the holy swords??You need to elaborate..... i mean he cant miss the fact that someone is wielding them or do you mean who told him about the bullshitness of them?All i can say is that i have no idea what the special does other than it gives hp, i dont know how much cause i dont use them and frankly i dont really care how much they give. It could have been any number of people who told dimi about them .... maybe jorel, just because he hasnt been online doesnt mean that he couldnt have told dimi about them, i know for a fact that several people talk to dimi from illuminati.Crem"
