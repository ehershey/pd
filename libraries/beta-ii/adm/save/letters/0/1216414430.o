__Letter "hi, sending this in case message didn't work.hi - i'm kinda losing out on two things, had session with pauland kinda down.  We know that stuff J did affected me, but more than I thought.I apparently do blame J for what happened to me. So... being on here isextremely hard.  Also, I have bronchial infection so resting most of the time.Paul said that what is hardest for me is that it happened and J doesn't evencare.  We're trying to work through that.  Anyway will try to come on later.   Taking cough medicine because my chesthurts.  Also, had to see doc and he said I'm getting rundown.  I'm glad you are still there for me.  It helps me a lot.hugs"
