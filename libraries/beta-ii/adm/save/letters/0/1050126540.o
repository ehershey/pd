__Letter "Oh come on please please please please please please please please can I get the prator stats. I dont' give a damn abut race/level/skills/class. I just wanna have fun below level 20 so Ash, I mean Daigotsu can't kill me when I try and exp. (hahah joking)Or how about Azira's old stats, never said you wouldn't bring him back. I only cided so I could come back with a different name without it looking obvious and getting pk'd all the time at low level.And why not give some of prator's bits back? Because I annoyed you? I didn't mean to piss you off so much, if you listened to illuminati lines you would see the dumbest arguments going on between me, drakule and ithilgore. We just do it cause it's fun, I should've realised you would take it more seriously.Ok, getting back to having some fun killing in lodos again, c'ya.(Please seriously consider shield, virtue and favour for paladins)"
