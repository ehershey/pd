My code is still very weak for a lvl 50 quest race move. Massacre paras me for 2 rounsd and i lose normal attacks too which is very harsh. Here's some temp code until a better change can be made (i cant code that well)   dmg = tp->query_skill(\"attack\")*3/2;   dmg += tp->query_stats(\"strength\")*5 + tp->query_stats(\"dexterity\");   dmg -= ob->query_stats(\"constitution\")/3 + ob->query_stats(\"dexterity\")/2;   dmg -= ob->query_skill(\"defense\")/3;   dmg *= 3/2;"
