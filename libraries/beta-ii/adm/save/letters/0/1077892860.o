__Letter "2 MINUTE MANAGEMENT LESSON ....     Lesson One:    An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing.  A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him \"Can I also sit like you and do nothing?\"  The eagle answered \"Sure, why not.\"  So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested.  All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.    Management Lesson:    To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.     Lesson Two:    A turkey was chatting with a bull.  \"I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,\" sighed the turkey, \"but I haven't got the energy\". \"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?\" replied the bull, \"They're packed with nutrients.\" The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, found it actuallygave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day,after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after afourth night, he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he waspromptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.    Management Lesson:    Bull Shit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.Lesson Three:    A little bird was flying south for the winter.   It was so cold the birdfroze and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there, a cowcame by and dropped some dung on it.  As the frozen bird lay there in the pileof cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was actually thawinghim out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. Apassing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following thesound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dughim out and ate him.    Management Lesson:    (1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.;(2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.;(3) And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut!    This ends your two minute management course. "
