__Letter "Hey, honey. A thought came to my mind just while ago. Do we wanna have anything special for the ceremony? Are there any particular things you want done? And I thought about vows and wedding rings, too. Are we gonna have that?It doesn't really matter to me what we do, but I wanted to check with you and see if there was anything in particular. The only thing I really want is vows (if it's okay with you) and wedding rings. And have it some place other than a church (I'm not much for church weddings). But I just started thinking, this IS a big event, even if it is just for pretend. So it wouldn't hurt to plan it a little more than we have, you know what i mean? I want to make it special. *smile*Well I hope to see you soon. As always, I'll see you when I see you. *Savannah kisses you deeply and vanishes to the shadows, waiting patiently for your return.*"
