__Letter "I never wanted it to go as far as it went. I blew up when I was continuously being touched, poked, ect. I never logged anything for that reason. I don't want the kind in trouble, I just want him to leave me the fuck alone. I think calling me names and talking about how much of a horrible person I am after he was warned should merit at least some proof in my part but once again, I didn't log it. Everything that I have for proof is from Daos and Soulfly.  I don't appreciate having to warn someone multiple times and then them being allowed to laugh at me.. I call this harassment because ANYTHING having to do with my name, my person, or my character consitutes me. I never wanted to get the admins this involved, I told Daos to ask him to leave me the hell alone because I don't think I should have to come on to play somewhere I enjoy and get pissed off. All that telling you guys has done is gotten me told not to fucking mess with him.. which last time I remember I didn't mess with him once.. he started everything he got, and now I'm having to explain myself to you because I've \"blown up for no reason\".Not to mention he got on a fucking alt and continued to try and piss me off.. how many times does he have to be told off by myself, Soulfly, and Hermes for him to understand that I don't want him fucking with me? And how many times do I have to just let it go before you people realize that I'm not picking on him or singling him out in any way and all I want to do is fucking be left alone?Sugarcandy "
