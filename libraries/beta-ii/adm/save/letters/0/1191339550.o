__Letter "I feel you have the right to know the reason why I posted about your new found ability to read tells. Yes, it's true that I don't know how you are doing it but it's pretty obvious that you are doing it. You will not tell me why or how you did it so I decided to post. You may not feel as though reading other peoples tells is wrong but I do. You have no law provildges that's what you told me. So why are you able to read my tells? You shouldn't be I feel as though it's very wrong for a guild immortal to be doing such things. So that's why I posted what I did on the Tirun board. Hope you don't take what I did as a personal attack because it wasn't I'm just doing what I feel is right.Noxus"
