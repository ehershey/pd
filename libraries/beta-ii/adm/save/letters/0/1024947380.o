__Letter "No I didn't think it was Druss. He's the guy who told me. I thought it was jekhar but he said that he'd never pay that much to kill me. So, now I've got no clue who it was and I think I could probably live without knowing even though I  REALLY want to know. You can't tell me so oh well I I'll live lol. :pLuv ya,Mocha"
