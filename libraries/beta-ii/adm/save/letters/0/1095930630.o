__Letter "RIP YOU APARTI will rip you apartI'll pull out all your painI'll cut out your heartand I'll do it again'cause I love to watch you hurt and crycan I kill you eight times before you finally die?'cause you remind me of a wormso defenseless while you squirmnot so beautiful like a butterflywho when killed once will fall and diebut you stay here through all the painyou were happy before I cameI will rip you apart from the inside outI will take all of your prideI will lie to you to get your trustAnd I'll slowly eat you aliveI'll drive you past insaneI'll make you go madAnd I'll cut your weak wristslike you should haveI'll hit that veinwith this knifeI'll kill your brainAnd I'll end your lifeI'll rip you apartI'll pull out all your painI'll cut out your heart And I'll do it again'cause you deserve this more than meAfterall, this is who you used to be-Ashley Carver "
