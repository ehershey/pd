__Letter "ok, so there were a few things that I thought could have been better on the event, and I just wanted you to know them for future events.  As great as it was to be apart of the winners, there should have been a few more people there.  I thought that b/c the last 2 mobs were HUGE!!, we should have been allowed to freely use area spells without hittin the other players.  B/C the ONLY reason that some people could not move on is b/c they were not within the partyrange of me cortoth and tia.  And the only one that could keep the dudes from hittin us, was cortoth using his area spell.  Also, I think it would be cool if we made different \"tracks\" so to speak.  Have it all the same for each player and just get an RSVP from players to know how many different tracks to clone, put the same mobs in the same places and see who gets to the end first...the mobs would not be able to be UNGODFULLY huge if that is the case though.  That way, people can use the attacks they want, and it is a race to the finish.  Noone can PK, noone can steal corpse's even if on accident.  B/C I know that that happened a few times, with people having autosac triggers on.  Also, as cool as it was to be part of the 3 that won, and it is cool that we were deemed Knights, especially as I am the leader of the only good guild in PD...There is nothing to show for that accomplishment.  I dont think people should new and rare equipment for winning these things as they are for fun.  But gold, or auras, or something in the finger info or just something visible to show the accomplishments of those that win the events.All in all, I thought this last event was fun as hell, and I thought Levi did a good job.It was just hard to gage your hp when there are 80 people in the room attacking the same thing, that is probably why there were so many deaths.obviously I am exagerating on the number, but you know what I mean.Those are just some things I could think of, you know I am not afraid to tell you more if I think of some.Thank you very much for the event, and I cannot wiat for the next one.and Thank you for listeningCarina"
