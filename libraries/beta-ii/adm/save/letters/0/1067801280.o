__Letter "Sun Nov  2 08:04:24 2003 from TsukeTo: Azire Subject: helpi was wondering if i could make a request. I don't know if it is allowed to asketc, but with a lack of immortals or admins being online compels me to ask anyway.Helena was caught in a bug during the angel quest where she became stuck, justbefore you get to the final room where you can choose to become an archangel,the room bugged or somthing when she rescued the girl and so she completed thequest, but didn't go to the final room. now seeker came online and helena gotaken back to tirun [], she went to do the quest again (hoping that it wouldn'tbug again) but the girl that gets rescued started to tell her that she hadalready done the quest and didn't need to be there (or somthing) and she becamestuck again, hence unable to get to the final room and unable to choose tobecome an archangel.my request, should you choose to grant it, is to put helena in the final roomwhere she can choose to become an archangel. i don't think this is too much toask, as she has completed the quest already and all she wants is to become anarchangel, but as been unable to due to a bug.     Thank you.          - Tsuke."
