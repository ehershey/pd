__Letter "He tells me that you and Set are both ok with him being allowed back into Unholy...And that all you two wanted was my thumbs up as it were, as well.  Now...In this matter.  I am neither for, nor against.  He did betray us in the past, i dont know if we can rely on him again when needed.  He is however a strong ally to have, rather than an enemy(not that i wont always be able to paste him once i start xping again course though)Anyway...I am claiming indifference.  If he's let back in, he's in.  but as a member only.  I would not accept him in a council position.  He has proved unworthy of such honour within Unholy.Anyway.  Thats all...  And could you maybe send me a guild update summation for the last 2 weeks?  i'v been mostly idle, and dont know much of whats going on overall...if not though, oh well.  I'll just kill people when i stop idling.Bellos d'Terrible - Assassin reeking of Hate and Wreathed in Death"
