__Letter "Hey baby, I was so busy last night that I didn't get a chance to log on until 3:30 am my time or 12:30am yours. :) So, there wasno way I'd have wanted you up -that- late. :) I guess I need to really put more focus on my own rest, because I was so tired cominghome from work that I nearly fell asleep driving. Prolly need a napafter class on Tues and Thurs. But, I am feeling pretty good now. :)And should I be blessed enough to see you later today, I will beoverjoyed. If not, my joy will wait. :) Anyway, I need to work onsome school stuffs today and call my mom, let her know about boxing match I take my father to Friday. :) That should be superfun, not to mention the 3 day weekend! :D (Gonna take a day)See you soon, wonderful one. :)Loving you much,Your James"
