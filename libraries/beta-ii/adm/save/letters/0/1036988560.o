__Letter "Most of these people are older, and if they are as mature as theysay they are, they should also ignore him. It may not be that easy, butit is possible. In my opinion this dragon can get annoying sometimes,but so does everyone, including myself. He is immature in some ways,and does have a strong childish nature to himself, which in some ways,gets very annoying. But, instead of getting totally annoyed and blowingup at him, you should remember the childish nature that has, most children are like that, and do not know when to stop. Vampira."
