__Letter "Hey, I'm sort of working on an area with Ruin, but I wanted to know if it was ok with you if I put a mob into my area and call him the Prince of Tenebrae, so I sort of tie up the storyline of the area...there's a princess who is in love with him and such and he's being held captive in the dungeons of my area... anyway the area probably won't even get into pd, but i want your permission before I go throwing that into it, since you wrote Tenebrae.  I figured, if it does get in, then at least it sort of ties some things together in pd... take care-jen(kumi)"
