__Letter "This is going to stormie and NS.Its wraith here, Like I told stormbringer, I need a favor to keep slysar from leaving altogether. I persuaded him to stay on a few conditions, No one else makes calls or harasses him on the builders port AND his character slysar is deleted ON GAME PORT so he can remake it(someone made it before him and is mocking him with it).You can keep me ridded/arrested or whatever, but remember this: I FIXED MY MISTAKE on builders with slysar, I talked to him and got him to recreate his nickname and had daos reinstate him. I have been loyal to PD for years, and I have had my share of goofs, as well as you 2 have and I have tried to fix all my mistakes.I heard that daos was pushing to rid my Wraith character, and ive got some facts you should hear about him that you've probably heard before, one of the reasons Im so rough with him is because of the things that he has done in the past.Im not going to beg and scrape for you to reinstate my character and my immhood, thats just not me. One of the main reasons that I was on builders with pyro is that I had an idea last night that I didnt share with him. Its to block call user and call immortal commands from all immortals unless it is their own person, that MIGHT go for archs and a few admins.Have fun."
