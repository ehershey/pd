__Letter "i personally do not know the bug myself, but i have heard of a money bug going around..this is the 2nd major money bug that has hit PD.  i am not sure if immortals are aware of it.  i have heard from word of mouth of its existance and i was hoping to see a money wipe to clear out the excess coins.  i know this is unfair to legit players and guild treasuries..but i guarantee there is a lot of corrupted pockets going aroundgoing to cc daos/nulvect on this , ciao"
