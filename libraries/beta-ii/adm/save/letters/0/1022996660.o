__Letter "Hey stormy...I'm sorry to be bugging you I know you're busy working on code.  However I'm extremly annoyed at the fact that people can escape pk.  I thought it was changed so you can't flee or teleport during combat?  I had artanis para'd and he fades into the shadows, escaping pk.  I know for a fact my para lasts 5 rounds on him.  Anyway...whenever you have time to look into it is cool."
