__Letter "Faust,I understand that in the Old World, before the time of Tirun, you and your bride Wildflower rules over all the demons.  I want to invite you to a very special occasion.  The Unholy are planning to revive Wildflower so that she can serve Asmodeus once again.  We invite you to our hall for that event.I will update you with the exact time.Long live Asmodeus, demon-god.Leviathas"
