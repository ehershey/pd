__Letter "Mr. Fred Rothert,	My name is Samantha Smith and I am an IPFW student in the F300 Invitation to Teaching class.  I am e-mailing you to inform you that I have signed up to complete my 15 hour field experience during your 10 grade English class/classes.  	To tell you a little bit about me and my background, I have worked in elementary and high schools in Mesa, Arizona.  At the high school I worked with Special Education in the Hearing Impaired department, this is where I was first introduced to the inclusion program.  I have always been interested in becoming a teacher, I was just unsure on the subject: English or Mathematics.  I have decided to major in English with a minor in math.	When it comes to the observation, I know that you have I-STEP testing going on next week, but I thought I would let you know the days I can come in: I am available anytime on Tuesday's, Thursday's, and Friday's.  Please let me know what times work for best for you. 	I look forward to meeting you and observing your class.  I hope that I hear from you soon, and that you're well until then.Thank you,Samantha S. Smith"
