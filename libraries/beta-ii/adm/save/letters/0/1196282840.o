__Letter "Hey stormy I know this is asking a lot and I dont want to seem ungrateful for what you've already done for me, but I was wondering if maybe I could get agent and/or mazrim backI'll give you a little back story so you dont have to look it up and i'll be honestThey were both either dester or banned i'm not sure how that works.. quite a while back..i believe agent was banned in 02 or '03 and mazrim in 05'They were taken away from me because I broke some rules regarding pk..i believe agents was excessive pk/trying to avoid law death, and I honestly thought mazrim was lvl 19, but apparently he was dested or w/e for breaking pk rules as well, chances are i lvl'd him, killed someone and bumped them out of the room or something stupid like that.I obviously know the deal on restoring characters probably better thananyone, you guys have restored a lot of characters for me over the years, even ones i suicided, which i obviously greatly appreciated. So if you decide not to i understand, but they were actually my first  characters ever on pd and i'd love to have them back, and if I did obviously I wouldnt break any more rules.. Iwouldnt even pk anyone i've lost that interest a while ago, i like helpin people exp now and just pwnin them in the arena heheThanks for your consideration"
