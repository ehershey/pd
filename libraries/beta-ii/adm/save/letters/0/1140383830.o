__Letter "Daboura, the following is what I mailed to amun for her marsh area 1-70________________I did a walk through your area Marshes, now I know that everyone before me hascommented on grammer and spelling, so I won't bother you with that.  But what I'vedone was gone through each room, and made a note of it.Marshesdocks- Good starting point, just need to fix a few typosentrance1- see point Aentrance2- see point Asquare- nice work with the board codearmour- I was told to never use the word you in a room description, although        Nesoo was okay with it in this particular room, you might want to look        at it.        I tried selling stuff here, and unless something is wrong with my body        code, I did not receive any gold, it minuses and I'm broke to start with.        Also you can sell weapons here.        example:  You sell Rusty Breastplate for -212 gold.                  You sell Decaying Pants for -212 gold.                  You sell Tarnished Great Sword for -265 gold.weapon- Again the word you appears.  And again I can sell either weapon or armour        here, and it minuses        example:  You sell Chipped Dagger for -265 gold.                  You sell Shirt of Tattered Rags for -106 gold.pub- See point A, I am leaving your menu to other admins that specializes     in balance to advise you on this.marshAreas 1 - 70 needs what I mentioned in point A.Below are some rooms I've come across, by no means is the listed rooms persugguestion is completed.  But when I remembered to logged them down, I did. 9- You got a cave to the east that really could use some look descriptions.    I'm assuming you are going to be adding to this area at a later date?  Also    I think it would be cool if you search scrub, something pops out at you.    This description is also room 24,54,69.12- nice description of the room, but I wouldn't broadcast which dragon made    the mess, cause how would one know which dragon did the damage only by    looking at charred remains?  This also goes for marsh 27,5714- Are you planning on adding to this area later?  If you are, make these    nouns lookable.  You got tunnel which I assume heads another direction    because marsh 13 is open land with a rock sliden debris.  and there is    no other \"side\" which would make this tunnel a cave.26- You have described a sharp turn towards the north, and there is no north    exit, you may want to change it to the direction of west.30- You have it leading to a graveyard and a cave, but neither is true.  This    was also found in room 16, 4533- I've seen this a few times by now, but maybe if in some of these rooms with    this description you have something can be seen floating in it's marshy    waters, you can make it where the corpse grabs you, it's just a simple emote,    and if you like, have it take a small amount of hp for scaring you.34- Or you can do that for this room that has a body lying in the middle of the     path.41- Same as room 2642- Same as room 1255- Change north to southmobsMarvello- description is fine, but I would like to see him more personalizedZeon- same as above, I was curious of how a centuar come across a job like thisRosie- same as Marvellocentaur-raknid-gremlin-sauran-half-elf-halfling- It is missing an l in the spellingdwarf-elf-weimic- nymph-gnoll-giant- spelled wrongfaerie-imp-illithid-ferrel-netherman-minotaur-skeleton-gnome-corpse-ogre-point (all stuff discussed below is personal opionion, you do what you like)A- I've noticed that you have a lot of lookable stuff, may be pointless to you,   but a wandering traveler going through for the first time, would like to look   at stuff as they go through.  It will make your area appear more interesting,   and explorable.  So basically, if it's a noun, make it lookable.Overall impression of your area.I went through and plotted your area, the map is very impressive and neat, if you are going to expand, you have left a lot of room to do so, or if someone wanted toadd to your current area, it is easily done.  I like the overall feeling of yourmarsh, I do sense it is not the place I want to be.  I think you have a nice arrayof mobs, but you do need to describe them differently, and I thought your currentdescriptions very colorful.  I did not go through the mobs fighting ability, forI think it should be done by the admins doing balance, I am not one of them.  I'm assuming your items in the marsh is for money making profits, also when it comesto items/weapons/swords, I will leave that up to the admins of balance.  Please understand that what I've mentioned above is all my opinion, and it's up toyou to decide how you want your area presented.  If you feel I've done a good jobwith this area, I will do the other parts of this area the way I've done thisarea.  I will await your decision.Hepualahaole"
