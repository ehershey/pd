__Letter "Well, Im startin to get a little money and Im wondering how much a type of oils shop would be for my guild and where the proceeds would go from the shop.The Darksouls Guild had Souls and Ashes for oils and stones, other then that I dont know what they did, If its not too much trouble could you talk to stormbringer about them and see how much it would be to put up one shop for both.I also want to know what percentage of sales from that shop would go to the Guild since it is privatly owned and accessed.Portals, How much are they going to cost and when can we expect them.Extra guild halls: What does that include as far as rooms and stuff.Sorry to be a bother, but I wanted to get all my questions in on one mail.Thanks for all your hard work on the guilds, you are doin a GREAT job man."
