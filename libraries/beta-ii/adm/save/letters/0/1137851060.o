__Letter "Hi. This is Vyce.Plague PKed my alt today. I have never even spoken over lines with this char so there is no reason to attack him besides the illegal one of Myst being Vyce's alt.Between this and the multiple times of harassing me over the lines which i previously logged, this is rediculous. He was previously banned for harassment of imms and i don't know why he was ever allowed back. Please take action on this as players like him ruin this mud.Thank you,-- Vyce"
