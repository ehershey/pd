__Letter "I was reading through the weapon.c , armour.c , user.c and monster.cI was thinking about possiably making the following functions intoprogrammables.extra_worn , extra_remove , extra_wield, extra_unwield , extra_hitand extra_dieWhat i mean by a programmable is that the mudlib would automaticallylook for these functions to be coded into the objects and thenexecute them if they are present. An example of ones already codedinto the mudlib are is_invincible() and affect_environment().It would make it alot easier for a builder to understand HOW toexecute a test for wearing/removing armour, wielding/unwielding weapons,and setting up routines for when something croaks or is hit :PIronmanI wont go experimenting on this thought until you and i discuss it."
