__Letter "alright, here we are! the description for the locker room. feel free to change anything.. add color, etc. A tall statue sits guarding the entrance to this large natural cavern. Soft red light emanates from what looks to be veins of ruby that run through the dark rock of the walls. At the rear of the cave sits a massive pile of treasure. It seems to be sorted into neatly organized piles.(look treasure) You think it would be safe to <store> your things here, where it will be guarded until you <reclaim> it.(look statue) A bejewelled dragon crouches beside the entryway, snarling a warning to all who enter. Its emerald eyes glint in the eerie red light. Surely it would not be wise to attempt to steal anything from here.SOUND: faint dripping breaks the silence.SMELL: Myrrh incense burns nearby, scenting the air here."
