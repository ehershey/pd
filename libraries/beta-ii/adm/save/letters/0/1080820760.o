__Letter "Heh it takes me so long? I could of been 100 ages ago, the fact is I can't be stuffed with it. I play this game for fun so I really don't care how high my characters get or not.Oh btw since you've reached 100 you've turned into a real moron, you should go look in the mirror and re-think you're life dude. Cause if you keep acting like they way you are sooner or later we're gona meet up IRL and i'm going to knock some sense into you.You're 100 con fucking grats, you have high stats, con fucking grats no one cares, go strut it all you like but no one cares and sooner or later it's going to hit you right back in your face.  --Eios."
