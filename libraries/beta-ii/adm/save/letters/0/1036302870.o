__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Hepualahaole to Hepualahaole Sat Nov  2 21:46:55 2002:-----I have to report this, because azire and I saw with our own eyes on how fast this person did the quest....Azriel within one min flat did the dragon quest and became a black dragon.  I was informed by you that there is a delay in the note, so......from another person this is how they are getting around your delayNightblaze replies: there putting the note in there locker...the note that hasthe number for that reboot...when reboot comes the note changes in thelocker...telling them the numberI will leave the person's name who told me so you will know who told me.  Please investigate this matter and confer with stormy, cause I will mail stormy this same letter, this matter has to be resolved in either desting this person for cheating, if you can't prove this is how he did it, then, fix the note so it doesn't save on reboot.  Or shut down the dragon quest.  What irks me the most is that no one reported this sooner.  Within the last so many reboots, we had a lot of dragons popping up everywhere.  Also on a note other then this, but still related to the dragons.......some people are creating more then two dragons, I was told that this is the limit of dragons we are allowed to have. "
