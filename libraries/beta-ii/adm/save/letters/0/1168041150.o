__Letter "Not sure why but builders is down. If it is the new code i addedtoday causing the problem, then comment out the lines in my sfunfile that use test_array(). I think i forgot to put test_arrayBEFORE security_screen.c like ya told me :(Please patch it if that is the issue. After thinking about it asecond as i typed this, im almost postive that is the problem.Just move the #include for test_array.c before security_screen.cin the simul_efun.c and the site should be fine.*sigh* I hate not having access if simul_efun.c or master.cgo loopy on me :PThanks in advance Whit. I know what is wrong but i just don'thave the power to fix it without the site being up.Ironman"
