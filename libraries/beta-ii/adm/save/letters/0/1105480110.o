__Letter "i got some more stuff for it :)I will use 2 grenades to destroy something when one works just    fine. I will flip a coin to decide which building to destroy,    then destroy both anyways. I do things for large sums of money that i would do for free otherwise. I will blow up 20 trucks in a row, just because I can. I am a mercenary, and I love my job."
