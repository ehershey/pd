__Letter "Seraphim the highest order of angels in heaven they have been described as incorruptible brilliant and powerful. they are the closest angels to god and are in direct communication with him. it is said that they are so radiant that not even the Cherubin and the Ophanim can look upon them. If humans stood in their presence they would be incinerated. They control the motion of the heavens as it flows out from god. Their essence is love, and they are called the Angels of Love. Through their purifying powers, they move humans to a love of God. They surround God's throne continuously singing the Trisagion, a song of celebration. The Book of 3 Enoch (26:9-12) says that there are four Seraphim corresponding to the four winds ot the world. They each have six wings corresponding to the six days of creation. Each wing is the size of Heaven. The name Seraphim is a combination of the Hebrew word Rapha, which means \"healer\" and ser which means \"higher being.\" They are represented by the serpent, which is a symbol of healing. The leader of the Seraphim is Serapiel. The ruling princes are Michael, Serapiel, Jahoel, Uriel, Camael, Metatron, and Nathanael. They are also called Seraphs.
