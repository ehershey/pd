__Letter "I just had an idea for the random room maker which could allow it's quality to skyrocket.  You know how you have to be very careful not to contradict yourself when making two descriptions, because you know there can't be 'thousands of rocks on the ground' and 'a large pool of water here'?  Well, why not set it up like this?group A.) 20 descriptionsgroup B.) 20 descriptionsgroup C.) 20 descriptionsThe rooms are made randomly, but it never uses a description from outside of a group.  That way you can make 20 different ones in each group, but you don't have to worry about contradicting.  This brings a number of descriptions which probably would have maxxed out between 20-30 (because not a lot of coders have good imaginations) up to 60.Just an idea."
