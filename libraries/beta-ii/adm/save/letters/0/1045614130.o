__Letter "Hey there. You said you wanted me to mail you so here ya go. :)  I pretty much already told you everything I had to talk about when we were online together. Unless you wanna hear details of the date, but i doubt that. Well, I didn't get near the xp i needed today. I've got 20mil out of 73mil. But I'm trying to get 6mil a day, and today (so far at least) I've only gotten 2mil.  :(   Oh well. *shrug* Well I guess I'm gonna go ahead and log off and start on homework...or i might just idle and wait to see if anyone interesting comes online while i do my homework... Somehow i gotta get rid of these 200 oils, though. Talk to you later,Savannah"
