__Letter "Unfortunly the guild is dead. All my members are alts of other people and I cannot run the guild. I would like to close down the guild and transfer some of the items over to the Forsaken guild which is where all the members of Acheron will be relocating to. I realise that Wraith has worked well on making the rooms and items but I would like to recieve about an 80% refund of money on the guild.The items I would like to transfer over to the Forsaken shops are the Spiders Websack and the Sash of Acheron. If the sash could be rename to %^ORANGE%^Sash of %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^For%^RESET%^sa%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^ken%^RESET%^ that would be great.I've add up the cost of all the things I would like a refund to, they are in the list below and i've also minused the 20%.Cost of new guild: 500kSub hall: 375kPortal to Helgrath: 100kGuild Lockers: 300kPrayer Room: 125kShops x2: 500k*The Portal to Helgrath was actually 125k not 100kTotal - 20%: 1540000 goldI haven't counted the 2 guild items because I would like them transferd as I have stated above.If there is a problem with any of this could you please mail me and prehaps we could figure something out.  --Eios."
