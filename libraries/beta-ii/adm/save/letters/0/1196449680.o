__Letter "I have the cablemodem hooked to a nic on an openbsd box thatdoes firewall/nat/local dns/updates dyndns.The other nic on the firewall is hooked to a switch and the othercomputers are hooked to the switch. The inside nic on the firewallhas a static IP, everything else is dhcp (oh yeah, firewall runs dhcpd too),but I set up the dhcpd.conf so that certain MAC addrs get certain IPs,so it _looks_ like it's static. The firewall uses dhclient on theoutside nic to grab an IP from the ISP.I've never heard of red wall. pf is so easy to use :PAs for the other coax, it's probably just another dynamic IP, in whichcase you can't really use it to run bind. Only way to know for sureis to hook a box up to it, run tcpdump, and see what's going over the wire.Um, mac mud clients... I don't know any offhand. I bet tinyfugue wouldcompile with a little effort. You'll just have to google if you wanta native client though."
