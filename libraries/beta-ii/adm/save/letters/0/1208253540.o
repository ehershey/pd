__Letter "Hey love, I spent most of the night at the hospital since the ER was kinda busy. I wasnt hurting nearly as bad as some of the poor folks there.One guy was brought in by wheelchair bellowing. It was a lil scary.Another guy was moaning and the kind of moaning where you're -not-having a real good time. When they finally saw me, they listened tome breathe, did some chest x-rays and took some blood to be sure.They also stuck a needle of pain reliever in my bum! My bloodworkwent ok, I had a couple breathing treatments but I guess they reallycouldn't figure out what exactly was wrong. I am to make an appt.with my doctor today. So, I will call before long. I hope you didnt worry much, but I do thank you for being there forme. You were with me in my heart. :) I guess I'll get some rest soonand hopefully, you rested very well. :) See you later, love!All my love,Your James"
