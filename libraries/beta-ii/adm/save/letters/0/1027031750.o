__Letter "KK i found some stuff out recently that will help you out since paladins are underpowered as you say.A non-raknid does not have a cap on his normal attacks at lvl 50. Normal attacks are a fighter's only bet for good damage.You can slash and boost since your a paladin as you know.. but i would recommend against this. Use jab or whirl. Here's why --Normal attacks are based off how much sp you have. more sp = more damage. Your best bet is to usually just idle fight with big damage specials (diamond longsword or demon slayers if you have the money). This way your getting max damage from your swords and you dont need the special attacks like slash. Slash will add 500 damage in a round but you probably lose 20 damage per normal attack because of lost sp which adds up to 100 lost. Then you lose a whole round while you boost/rub oil which is another 100 damage lost and the loss of what ever move you could do in that round.Best bet would be to keep leveling. With your stats you dont need anymore for a good while. Normal attacks make all the difference in the world and if you can get your hands on some of the stuff in wraith's throne room you'll be even better off probably.Kick some ass man :)-- Ash"
