__Letter "O.k Makaveli, lioyd, arim, fender all the same person, so I think we need to totally redo the guild. Like our membership is finally good (I think, I've never met khristala or hellion)  We should rename the guild. It might have worked for Makaveli and his dumb self but it does not work for me. So if you've got any ideas let me know and we'll talk bout them.Mocha."
