__Letter "Ok, this has now happened to me twice now. I go into a battle that I KNOW! I can win... and begin raging. In the most recent example is with 3 bears on the cliff up to roston. Anyways, I start raging... then either MASSIVE lag hits me, or Gmud is locking up. I'm not sure which. I get paranoid about how my char's doing, so I close the program and log back on as soon as possible. Next thing I know, I'm sitting in the room, with my deer that says \"a happy deer (ridden by Cookie)\", somewhere around 300 hp, 30sp, and 10mp. And then, I find out I'm a ghost. To save time from having to find my way from roston back to the temple in tirun, I save, then quit, and log back onto my char and re-pop into my guild. I go back, pray, go to where my stuff should be, all this in plenty of time to get my stuff before it disapears or is looted... and it's not there. the remains of any mobs I killed are there... but no corpse of mine. My only idea is it's locked away in the freezer, unaccessable by me. Which bites of course.   Now I don't have my stuff, I will loose 4 starscreams, 4 diamond blades, 6 diamonds, boots, armour out the wassoo, etc etc. Can anything be done about this? I honestly am not trying to cheat and get out of the room or anything, it happened just like I said both this time, and the other time Wraith was around and helped me. Maybe make the persons stuff gate to where they last were... outside the freezer, maybe go to them when they pray... something. In the mean time, if I could get my swords, armour, and 6 diamonds back, I would be thankful. If it costs me gold, let me know. I have about 1.2 mill I'd be willing to spend if it's required. Anyways, thanks again Paul. Catch you later.Cookie (Ryan)"
