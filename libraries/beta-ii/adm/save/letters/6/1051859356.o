__Letter "Well, I know you put the warning in there about looking before you attack. However, that monster should not be in play in an area where anyone can get to it. Not even in purgatory do I have monsters that do that much with just melee rounds.As far as slash, you should have put it back to what it was before you went offline, it is doing NOTHING for damage. That was just irresponsible and it leaves everyone with the slash ability as their main attack up shit creek without a paddle.This mail also goes to stormbringer."
