__Letter "Please forgive my ramblings.Icharus was never a builder here, in fact he was proud when his own ideawas used hter*hereA number of time i have read Pet say, if you go onto another mud and seesomething you like, mudidea it and they would try and code it.  That iswhat Icharus did with maps, he used the idea, coded it, worked out problemswith it, but also enhanced itIcharus was one of the most caring players i have ever come across, i hurthim a number of times, but did he turn his back on me, kill me, be rude tome or ignore me?. No, he would always talk to me, tell me how he felt, ialway knew exactly where i stood with him.Some people didn't like it when he brought up some concerns, they wouldthink he was attacking them in some way, probably more so because of theirown guilt.Casp.*smooch*Wisp"
