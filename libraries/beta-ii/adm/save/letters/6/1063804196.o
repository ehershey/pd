__Letter "I'm not sure if you know this. Byron is no longer in control of the character Gabriel. In fact, it was at the point where he left Illuminati and joined Forsaken that Dylan took the char. The reason he is in forsaken is because Dylan is Lac.Byron had stopped playing PD by then so it didn't matter to him. I only thought of it now because I saw 'Gabriel' on the members list for the Forsaken webpage, and from the finger info he's been online since the mud came back up, even though Gabe doesn't play muds anymore.The character 'Gabriel' gets arrested?Just thought I should bring that to attention since it is against the rules."
