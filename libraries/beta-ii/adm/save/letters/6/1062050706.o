__Letter "Stormbringer,. . Thanks for understanding about the title incident. I had noidea it would cause such an uproar with the players. You can restassured I won't make the same mistake like that again.. . As far as the advertisement goes, just something along thelines of \"PD is sponsered by Tek Genesis. For all your hostingneeds, check out their website at http://www.tekgenesis.net/\", ora shorter version of that, would be great.. . You can go ahead and send it to paypal@tekgenesis.net, and Iwill go ahead and renew it for another year. It's $10 per year. Idon't plan on keeping it in my name, because it's not my domain.. . Let me know what you want listed as the registrant for thedomain. I will setup a special account for it that we can bothhave access to as well.. . I am on here only because kumi told me I got a mudmail (shelikes to use the finger command! :) and you were on aim earlier,but it looks like you have gone for the night, so I guess we cantalk later.Jason"
