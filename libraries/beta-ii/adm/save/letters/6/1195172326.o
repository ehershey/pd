__Letter "Hello my love, today just wasn't in our stars.  A friend dropped over andshe had a tale of woe to tell me.  I did not want to leave so suddenly, butshe was not very happy.  I wanted to spend time with you today, to talk toyou, to hug you, hold you and at least have a little honeymoon with you.I know that will come in time, but just being married, I feel like you weretorn from me.  You are such a huge part of me and it is like the monster withouta frankenstein (not that I'm comparing you to either one), just ametaphor.  Better example might be, you are the tide to my moon,you are the heat to my sun.  You get the idea.Or we are like Mini Me and Dr. Evil (again no comparison), justthe closeness.  You are my oxygen, I need you to live and love (loe)and you do complete me!  heheWell, my love, I will hope to talk to you later.  I do know that Scilla has put something in her chfn about Boco,she really likes him a lot!  Perhaps it is time he settled down.  I know she would be good for him and to him.Enough ramblings my love, I miss you immensely.  But, if all works out, I can spend Saturday night with you completely.I love (loe) you so much that my heart will break if it gets any fuller.As forevers yours,Xeniaxoxo"
