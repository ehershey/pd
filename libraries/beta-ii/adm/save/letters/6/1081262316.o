__Letter "I've been doing a lot of thinking recently. I've realised that, while I'm on here a lot, I don't really do that much playing anymore. I mean, I basically check for diamonds, chat and that's it... most of my work's done on notepad or on the builder's port (or both). That said, playing is a bit of a distraction to me; I wish I could focus entirely on building without worldly concerns. As such I suppose I'm signalling that I'd like to apply for an immortal position on Primal Darkness; not with Sasayaki but with a completely new character. (well, sorta; it's a level 5 ATM I think, I've played him once, heh) I have an event/quest written out for the whole thing. My dragon is for roleplaying, and I'd dearly love to keep him, although I have no interest in playing the rest of my alts.  As for actually being an immortal, I guess I'm fit to do whatever task you have set for me; although what I'd *really* love to do is assist Daos and the other immortals in fixing typos, bugs, and grammer errors in the areas across the MUD and writing new messages for spells and abilities, some of which really (IMHO) need a reworking. I'm also good for writing new spells and abilities for some of the under-represented classes on the MUD, and I'm good with writing up quests and such too. But, of course, anything you really need doing I'm good for too; but mostly I guess I'll spend my time coding and stuff, unless I'm given a specific task. Cheers, Sasa."
