__Letter "Hi, sorry I missed you. I hope you're not angry with me. I didn't sleep very much and had a very bad few days after letting ofthe steam that I needed. I don't know if you talked to Josh, I guess it won't matter anyway.I didn't realize how much it affected me.  I am not an angry person, butit was all vented up and I was trying to forgive him, but I needed closurebefore I could even move on.If you don't want to talk to me any more, I'd understand.  :("
