__Letter "Ok it's now more efficent to state what HASN'T been done yet....Only things left to do are seals, waxes, light_sources, vaults, and airports.I need to know if the AIRPORT inherit is being used before i go setting it up.Next on the menu is VAULT. I can easily do AIRPORT as well but i just needto know if it's being used or not.All other inherits present in the std.h include file are now scannablewith my new command.  Please come put it through it's paces and give mefeedback on it.  I wholeheartedly feel that this command is going tospeed up the evaluation and review process for areas tremendously.Ironman"
