__Letter "Since you ignored both my im's and my tells I figured I would try one more time to communicate with you.  You said if I brought Satiin on you would spend more time with me or at least talk to me.  I did and never got any response from you on im or here.  I understand you are doing more important things now.  But I am not just your mud wife.  If I am let me know so I can stop trying to rearrange my whole life.  The reason I started making alts was because as your wife no one spoke to me, not even you.  Except those from shadow that don't really like you and pal and all his alts.  Mostly they respected the fact I was so dedicated to you as a spouse.  I made an alt and had no problem with attention even though everyone knew it was me.  I have two alts over 20.  While you have been busy ignoring me I have hit hm twice.  This was done because you have been to busy doing God knows what when I was coimming on everyday as satin.  I wanted to prove you have become to busy for me so I came on last night.  "
