__Letter "Welcome to the path, you have found your way and been given direction. Remember to follow your heart and soul in things to come, in the decisions you will have to make.If you get lost, remember to follow the horse that was given to you, it should lead you back to the right path wherever you choose to wander. I wish you well on your journey, and hope that our paths will cross sometime.Chris."
