__Letter "OK. if your not interested in the store idea. Ill shelf that fornow. I have another idea that came to me.I wish to build a bounty system for the players. It would work asfollows;    1) person places bounty on a player for X gold.    2) bounty is registered with an NPC that would mantain a       board listing outstanding bounties.... target and       the amount posted only. The buyer would be seen only       by immortals.    3) A hunter picks up the contract on the target.    4) Once the target is PKd. They return to the NPC for       the gold placed.This would give an active way for us to regulate the PK rate."
