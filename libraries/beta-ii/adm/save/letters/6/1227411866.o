__Letter "Hi Nul - a quick question for you.I killed Zulpo today and from reading the rules I know I can't PK him for another 5 days (I have no intention of killing him again after either incidently).Is he allowed to attempt retribution on me in the next 5 days? If he does attack me during the 5 days am I allowed to defend myself?Thanks,-- Ozzy"
