__Letter "Yah know man, I have been trying to get guild items for EVER! and I havn't gotten ANYWHERE. I keep asking and asking and asking and asking and asking..... shall I go on, and nothing! And yet Kumi's guild gets ANYTHING they want WHENEVER they want, it disgusts me. all I want is a guild shop, some items, and a specialty item. I had it all written down, and had sumbitted everything, and still NOTHING! I am REALLY sick of seeing other guilds get items while I get ignored. yah, so I'm done ranting. bye"
