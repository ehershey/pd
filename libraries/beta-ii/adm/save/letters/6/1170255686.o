__Letter "I've told you before bud. I do not mind throwing my hat in the ring.This place needs work done and you know i can handle the coding thatis required. Please. Raise Ironman here on the main port and give mea shopping list of things you want done. At that point, you wouldonly need to check over the work every couple of days.You seen what i was able to engineer on Builders for you :) Justgive me your wish list, the power to do it, and watch :PI think you will be pleased with the results.I'll can handle the place for you and all decisions WILL go thru you.If you are interested in my helping here on the main port, Tell meand I'll mail you a list of things i thing would improve our player base.It's things that i constantly hear from the people as they're leavingthe mud. The #1 complaint is lack of commands. It gets boring only beingable to kill with the same 3 or 4 commands..... So they lose interest.My _summary.c command on builders shows you what i can do with commandsbut i would leave that department in the hands of Nulvect. He just needsto design more commands for each class so people aren't getting bored withour beloved mud :(Ironman"
