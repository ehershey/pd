__Letter "Look, I'm sorry I'm so damned stubborn, I really am sorry...I'm almost in tears over here because of how bad I treated you adn I know I said I doubt I'd be able to get on the game but after you hung up my heart felt like it stopped beating for a second. I love you Simran and I'm sorry if I hurt you in any way, it'll never happen again. But I really do wish you'll do some stuff like that every now and then for me, I know it's asking a lot because you don't want to do it in the first place but just trust me on it. I will never force you into doing another thing unless it's in the future and I have to force you to take medicine or something like that. *sighs and shakes his head* I'm sorry...I really am...please forgive me. I love you Simran...and I hope you still think so fondly of me as you did before. And the idea with the snow...it is beautiful, and as I said I do want to tell it to you over the phone, so if you don't mind I'll just tell you tomorrow when you're at Omants house. I love you Simran, so much. I hope you have sweet dreams tonight and a good day of school tomorrow.Forever and Always yours,Joshie.(P.S. Please forgive me)"
