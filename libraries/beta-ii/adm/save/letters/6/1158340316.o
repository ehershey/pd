__Letter "if you look at rangers in a old native american way... the knowledge of nature is the fuel for the fire when it comes to some magics. they lived they're lives around their \"totum\". rather then have a talisman..have a totum, which you can chose or do some sort of quest to decide what your totum should be. then with the totum you are more inclinded to be good in a specific stat or something. Like maybe have a lower cost to 1 specifc stat, or maybe turn into your totum at will (with consequences of course). "
