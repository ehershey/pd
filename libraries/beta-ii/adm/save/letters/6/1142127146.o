__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Cortoth to Ironman Sat Mar 11 20:29:48 2006:-----As you may or may not be aware of, mud administration has placed some restrictions on guilds as a whole, to try and prevent stagnation and encourage more active guilds.  Some of these restrictions we have gone discussed previously, such as 2 leaders per guild, and the requirement that one of the 2 guild leaders pay dues to the mud approximately twice a week or have the guild be auctioned off.There's also a coded guild restriction on total number of members now.  Currently, there doesn't appear to a limit on people at a particular rank.  Given that, and that we do have more active memebers than we used to, we are looking at rearranging our ranks to fit active membership.  We are giving all current members time to respond and be an active member in the guild.  No responce, or in some cases, not even logging on to read this mail, may result in demoting to a Dragon Warrior.  Right now the role of rank of Dragon Warrior will be reserved for new members, and members emeritus.  Planned date for demotion is on or after 4/1/06.Once our roster is more defined, we plan on defining roles of positions as well.  For any questions, please ask either Ironman or myself."
