__Letter "Gremlin Cleric: The Gremlin Cleric is little more than a personal assistant to the Gremlin Priest. They are small, frail, and sickly looking gremlins who are very shifty eyed and seem to have very little, if any self confidence. They wear nothing more than small robes that barely cover their bodies.Gremlin Priest: Preaching is what these gremlins are known for. Their voices are loud and full, but their frame is quite the oppossite. They are quite skinny and show little to no signs of muscle, other than their face. These gremlins are well suited for healing and preaching, not for the front lines of an army. They wear long robes that cover almost their entire body. Their feet are covered by leather sandals which are falling apart.Gremlin Scout: Carrying little more than a backpack and a shortsword, these gremlins are suited for scouting the landscape well before the army arrives. These small but well built gremlins are quick on their feet. Their confidence comes from the many years these gremlins have spent out in the wilderness alone and only equipped with what they could make. They wear shorts and a worn, usually green tunic. Their feet are covered by soft and well-worn boots.Gremlin Private: These gremlins are the grunts of the massive Gremlin fighting force. They are muscular, mean, and not pleasing to look at, usually missing body parts or even eyes. They wear heavy platemail army and are usually slow moving. They carry halbreds and broadswords. These gremlins are scarred from head to toe and usually stink because they go many weeks, or even months without bathing. They carry an aura of self-confidence about them, usually able to kill their opponents with one strike.Gremlin Sarge: These Gremlins wear chainmail and carry broadswords. They usually charismatic and are very good leaders. They wear rusty helmets on their heads, usually with holes in them. These Gremlins are loved by the privates, as they fight up front and are usually attatched to the squad in which they command. Often these gremlins have a limb missing but they are in better shape than the lesser ranks.Gremlin prince: Usually a son of a Gremlin Chief, these bold, young lads are strikingly handsome for a gremlin. They are also armed to the teeth and usually surrounded by elite body-guards. They wear chainmail and are very clean and well kept. Their helmets sparkle in the sun as they stand watch over their fathers troops. These gremlins carry ornamented swords which are more for show than actual combat. Some princes choose to carry battle axes, but most prefer the artistic swords over the axe. Gremlin warlord: These gremlins are very dangerous and sneer at even their own kind. They are vicious and combat-hardened veterans who have forgotten more combat than most will ever see. They walk with authority and rightfully so. They carry both beautiful, yet very deadly axes, polearms, or swords, whatever their preferance may be. They command respect and can often be seen picking on the lower classes, or even fighting them, all because they miss the sting of battle.Gremlin Chief: Easily the largest and oldest Gremlins, the Chief Gremlins command respect wherever they go. They command legions of troops and are not afraid in the least to take the fight to the enemy. They wear beautiful platemail armour and carry Javelins and swords, usually inherited. These gremlins are gray-beards, but even so, they are known for their prowess in combat and expeirence they wield. Be warned, they are by far the most revered and feared gremlins of all.-PiehlI have, I hold the key... To nothing."
