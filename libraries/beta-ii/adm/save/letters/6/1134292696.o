__Letter "The Forsaken Guild is a guild of the masters of battle and the arts of warfare. Skilled in both the physical and magical disciplines their name invokes fear into all who would oppose them. The Forsaken wander the lands in search of challenge and treasure. Members are easily distinguished by their sash and the coldness in their eyes and heart. Entry to this Guild is only able through invite.*** We have made a few changes to it and would like that put in when you can.  --Eios."
