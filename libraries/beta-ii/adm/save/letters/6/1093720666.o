__Letter "From what I saw, the entire group thought you were not helping at all.  The discussion was only a discussion.  What was decided there is just a group of opinions.  What they thought up there isnt nessecarily going to be used or even considered.  So you werent left out of a mud changing event.  A group of people having a conversation thought you were not being helpful to the conversation.  I checked for any alts from your IP, and I havent seen any.  I would wonder if someone who has only a level 1 character would even know enough about the classes here to give constructive input.  In either case, I will talk to the imms involved, but that is all the action that will be taken on the subject.                              -Nightshade"
