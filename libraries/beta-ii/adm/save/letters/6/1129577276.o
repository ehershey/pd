__Letter "If you can do any of these things, that would be great.  Please let me know if there's anything you'd like to put into the event too.  =)Things that I would like to be in the daemon (or otherwise incorporated, if you think that would be better):1.) If a player over level 65 enters the event area, a monster will spawn and stalk them, attacking.  The idea is that this monster will slow them down a bit, so they can't just plow through the littler ones.  The message would read \"The Spirit-Guards of the Summoner detect your approaching power and take form to do battle!\"  It would be especially cool if the mob was removed if they leave the area, with the message \"The spirit dissipates as you leave its range.\"2.) If I give you a short list of mobs, they spawn in each room of the area, and then wander around.3.) I will just clone the 'bosses' and manually put reward items on them.Other Special Code requests---------------------------I have a monster, anavastein.c  Would it be possible to make it so damage done to it by magic just heals it?"
