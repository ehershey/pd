Yes, it. Let's justsay this is not the best day. I was starting to despair a littlewhen I heard your song. And indeed, just knowing you were there, though I couldnt hear you cheered me up.I'll tell you more when I see you on next. Sorry for the confusingand cryptic conversation. Didnt mean to creep you out. :(Talk to you soon, I hope and I love you very much. :)Love,Your James"
