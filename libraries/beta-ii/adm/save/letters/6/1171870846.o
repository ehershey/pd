__Letter "Heya Whit. Kazuma is me, irl we are the same people, all that good stuff. If you want I'll let you test me or something. Arma and Joker live around here, and they have almost unlimited connection to the MUD. I really would like to play my angel, Kazuma, again, but it's really hard to do so because they know who he is and they won't leave him alone. I was wondering if it would be at all possible to get his name changed. Please let me know. You can mudmail me, or e-mail me. My e-mail is brem@z6.com. Thanks man, and I hope all is well with ya."
