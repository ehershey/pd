__Letter "Hey honey, i just wanted to let you know that i will be out and about for awhile tonight. My friend wants to hang out with me and i decided i should get out of house for a little while, but i'll be back in a little while i'm sure i'll talk to you tonight still :) Anyways, i just also wanted to tell you thank you for everything you've done for me and for how happy you've made me in this short time, i feel like we've known eachother for so long and i am so close to you... i hope you feel the same as i do because my mind is already wandering into places about us it probably shouldnt be, but i cant help it i like you so much... I can't wait to see where this leads because i see nothing but good things ahead... Well, i'm sorry for getting a little long winded but i will talk ot you as soon as i possibly can. I'll be on pd still but i will be not here. Anyways <3 you... i do... I miss you so dearly and i can't wait to talk to you... Bye sweetheart :) *hugs and kisses*Chris."
