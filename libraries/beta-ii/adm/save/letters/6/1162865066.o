__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Ironman to Stormbringer Mon Nov  6 20:17:58 2006:-----I have located a bit of a nasty bug on builders.I tried to fix it myself to plug the hole but my patch didn't work :(The problem is in \"/std/living.c\"->add_search_path() . It had NOsecurity screens present in it at all to test for if the personexecuting the addition to the commands path is an archwizard oradministrator. As a result of this, any builder may go ahead andadd the path for /cmds/adm and have all the adminstration commands...Not good at all folks...Please come help me rectify this hole in the security.IronmanStormy"
