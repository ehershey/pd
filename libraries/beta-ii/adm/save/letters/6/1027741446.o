__Letter "Here's the desc the the sub hall and the 2 portal rooms.The portal room to helgrath could it please be put in 2 south from the guild board. The portal back to tirun canit be located west.I'd like the sub hall to be located 'down' from helgrath square. 'tap stone' to get there.sub-hall desc (bright blue):This hall is much smaller then the Acheron main hall. Hidden underground it is the perfect place to get away from others. From the small sky window you can see the Helgrath Square. Stairs upwards lead there and west is the way back to Tirun.portal desc (bright blue) tirun to helgrath:Before you stands a glowing portal, pulsating with tremendous power. The room is completely dark the only light source comming from the portal it self. Above the portal is a sign reading Helgrath.portal desc (bright blue) helgrath to tirun:Before you stands a glowing portal, pulsating with tremendous power.
