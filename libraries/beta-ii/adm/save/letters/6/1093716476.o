__Letter "There was a conversation on the changes that were going to be put in, such as spells being removed and changed to fit the classes.During this, I was removed from the conversation by Daos, and everyone was brought somewhere else.They had no reason to do this, and I feel its disgusting that they feel they have the right to remove me from the changes that will affect everyone, including me.They claimed I got \"off topic\" too much, even though I only got off topic once, not knowing the order we were doing things.However, Helena thought it was on topic to talk about a shield spell that would be a stick of light in your butt, defleting hits from monsters.I feel this is an abuse of immortal powers, and would just like to notify you."
