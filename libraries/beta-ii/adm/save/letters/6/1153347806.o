__Letter "I realize there has been alot of shifting around of IMM's and such but just wanted to ask about my guild. Its been half finished for a couple months. Daboura started to work on it but then gave up when he started working on abilities. I have the money in the treasury and its partially built but a few more things need to be added. The room and mob who is supposed to seell the guild oil and stones is in place, however he doesnt sell anything yet. I'd like to get at least these things fixed so I can hopefully make this guild a little more active. I have the names and desc's for the oil/stones made on my builder char. However they don't have any healing properties yet(I think someone told me I was supposed to leave that for whoever put in in the game) They are in /wizards/gob/item Grog.c being the oil and dubloon.c being the stone. Feel free to talk to me on this char or my alts Gob or Valas. Thanks"
