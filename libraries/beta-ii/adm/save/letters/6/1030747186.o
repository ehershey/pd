__Letter "Stormy,I had an idea that is a bit too complex for the idea command.  It involves NPC personalities.I just heard Endbringer on the newbie line say \"chatting with npc's is boring =/\" and it got me thinking.  What if we had various personalities for NPCs and various conversation key words that caused them to speak based on their personalty? I could create maybe 15 different personalities and maybe 3-5 different responses for each keyword used on them, and maybe some more outgoing personalities could speak to you without you starting the convo.  This could help a lot with quests and make the game more enjoyable.  There could also be an option of adding speech to your NPC, and if we really wanted to go in deep we could do some stuff for individual races, too.I'm willing to put in the time to make up these personalities/responses if you think it'd be a good move.  I obviously can't code it but I imagine the code would be the smaller part of the project.Lev"
