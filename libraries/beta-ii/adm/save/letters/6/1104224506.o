__Letter "I would like to formally apply for immortalhood.I know lpc pretty well, and I know how to balance the needs ofthe mud as a whole against the wants of the individual players.I have played every subclass at least a bit, and I have seen muchof the mud. I've been around for quite a while.If there is anything more you want to know, just ask."
