__Letter "If you wouldnt mind, id like to post on the newbie boards about complaints. I just read something about gabriels slash only doing 220 damage, whish is 110 per slash, and thats pretty damn good. anyways, my post would be along the lines of quit repeating yourselves on subjects that have already been looked over, fixed, and balanced by you, like slash etc. and to only post about abilities if they seem truly underpowered, like a lvl 20 move that does 10 damage at lvl 40 with maxxed skills and stats over 50. stuff like thative been reading all these posts that are just repeating themselves on abilities that have been looked into by you, and they are still complaining about them. if it gets on my nerves this much it has to be grating on yours like a son of a bitch.lemmie know what you think about that kind of post, since balance and abilities are your area."
