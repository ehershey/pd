__Letter "Hi, I'm staying at my Dad's today to rest, so I'm not sure when I'll be back at my place. I feel like I've been run over by a truck. :PHe has his computer set up strange and I can't get access to the email. He has some proxy thing set up and I tried to access the email, butit's acting strange. I'll try using my old yahoo account so I can email you.Tell summer to back off :)  lolhugs"
