__Letter "\"To think of all the work I put into that guild, knowing the whole time you hadpower to remove me whenever you felt like it.\"It's not like that.  Wildflower was a security risk with power, and I demoted her to member until I could figure out what was going on.  But then you removed her and got pissed off.  I DO care why you left Unholy, but what I care about is irrelevent next to guild security."
