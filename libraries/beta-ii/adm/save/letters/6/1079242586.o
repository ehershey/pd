__Letter "OKay well that's kind of a bad place to leave off conversation, so I thought i shou.d explain. The \"yes yes yes :) :) :)\" thing was my second best \"typo\". It wasn't really a typo though, it was just a tell to someone that i accidentally put over illuminati.

Crem happened to be online at the time and he was just like \"O.o\" Hehehe it was pretty funny. Well *waves* cya and good talking to ya :)"
