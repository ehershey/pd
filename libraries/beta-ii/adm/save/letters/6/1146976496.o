__Letter "The Court of the GOOD FAE: Seelie. The Court of the BAD FAE: Unseelie. (you might want to read the book 'War For the Oaks' by Emma Bull. lots of good Fae stuff in there, and hey - it's set in my city, Minneapolis/St. Paul - Minnesota!)Foxes and Owls were said to be the 'watchers' or 'guardians' of an entrance to the Faerie realms. If you were to see a fox in the bracken before you, you could guess at an entrance somewhere nearby. Entrances weren't anything as obvious as a mushroom circle, no no - not when it was to the true kingdom of the fae. A rock with a natural hole in it (like a doughnut) was one definite doorway into the fae realms. Ground hugging mists, another. an arc in a tree branch that touches the ground could serve as a portal also.Perhaps a good NPC for players to interact with would be a Poukha (a puck) . They could either lead them astray or guide them safely through based on their charisma. (bad charisma might HELP you with a puck, you never can tell!) Those who didn't get along with the puck might find themselves dumped in sewage or something gross - or dumped into the middle of a battle. Those who get along with the puck might find a gift, or be led to the center of the faerie courts.It might be fun to do a simple faerie court, the queen of the Seelie - the queen of the Unseelie (enemies, of course.) ... maybe you could choose (HAVE to choose) a side to be on everytime (each time?) you enter the realm?a simple hierarchy would be like this:Queen Of The Court (light or dark)Powerful/Old Fae creatures \"Nobles\"Lesser Fae (sprites, gnomes) \"Common\"Low Fae/ Free Radicals (pucks,other fae with obscure jobs like .. hmm... say .. the floss/dental hygiene faerie)\"lowest\"Anyway, that SHOULD get you started. *cackle*"
