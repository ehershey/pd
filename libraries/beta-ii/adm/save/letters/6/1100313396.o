__Letter "%^BOLD%^RED%^**NEWS**%^RESET%^There may be a %^BOLD%^lot%^RESET%^ of changes going on within the ranks of Unholy, and with our Dark Regime itself.Leadership may be changing, for the better.  You will have me no longer just being of higher rank and conscripting those to Asmodeus' cause.  but you will have me, and Set, as leaders of you Chosen few.Set - the Mind of Asmodeus, and I - The Hand of Asmodeus, will lead Unholy towards its pinnacle of power.  Asmodeus will look upon you all with favour for we shall spread the Darkness throughout the realm.  Set and I will be doing all within our combined powers to bring about this shift in the tide.Once, in all likelyhood soon, Set and I are leaders within our cultist Rebellion, we will also begin to build onto our hall...It has never been finished, and with both ours, and your blood, sweat, and hard work...Unholy will grow...  We will dig out more cavernous rooms for us to fill with whatever we so choose.  We will forge and fabricate whatever can help us in our cause.  Asmodeus will look upon our hard work with great favour, and we will grow strong.%^GREEN%^~*~%^BOLD%^BLACK%^The Hand of %^MAGENTA%^Asmodeus %^BLACK%^- Bellos d'Terrible%^RESET%^GREEN%^~*~And remember...  %^MAGENTA%^BOLD%^Asmodeus%^RESET%^ is always watching..."
