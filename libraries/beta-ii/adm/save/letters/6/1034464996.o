__Letter "Soulfly <newbie> there's young children on the mudMochaprincess <newbie> I'm not a yound children!Mochaprincess <newbie> god.Faust <newbie> yes, you are mochaFaust <newbie> your under....how old are you now?Mochaprincess <newbie> no, I am not, you think this convo is bad for me? ha, Ihear worse from people at school.Leviathas <newbie> Yea but Ariel will lay the smackdown on whoever puts you ina cussing phase.I am so tired of people treating me like this just because I am Stormy's daughter. Big deal! I am 13, and believe me I heard things way worse than this everyday. People need to treat me regular, like they treat each other. It annoying and I'm tired of being treated like a 4 year old. No offense to Faust, but he's the worst about it, the definition of a child is someone under 13, I am nearly 14. Again no offense to Faust but he's the most persistent of them all.Mocha."
