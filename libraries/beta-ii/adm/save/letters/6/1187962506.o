__Letter "For some reason, when I logged on, I had lost: one diamond bladed longsword and 1 dark cutlass. Since my weapons were not deficient, I didnt worry much. Then while idling in Lodos, I get this message:You remove your a backpack.This was completely out of the blue and I entered no command to make thishappen. When I checked, it was out of my inventory and gone.I am hoping you could look into this situation and stabilize it.Thank youRalok."
