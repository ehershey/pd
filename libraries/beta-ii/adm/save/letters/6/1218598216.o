__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Bellos to Skunk Tue Aug 12 20:14:28 2008:-----Ok so I looked over the <changes> list when I logged in today...Cause I remembered seeing Dalamar running through the guild, but he's now Vorticon...  soo uhhh...I was thinking...From here on out, any who \"resign\" from Unholy...I think should become an immediate PK target for any and all members of the guild to take out whenever a chance arises.Of course we'd have to follow the rules on PK and Guild PK etc...But ye know, would encourage a little more unity in the guild.  And discourage people from joining that don't intend to stay.We don't need people touring our guild hall, and then leaving with possibly taking notes off our board and things we say over the line.  Ye know...just a thought...But im getting sick of the \"passerby\" mentality some of the wankers wanting in have.  I think Spartanist Rule has to be reinstated in this guild.  No more lolly gaggers.  If anyone wants in.  They prove their mettle.What I mean by this, when I ran things soley, after Leviathas left Unholy for dead(and left it to Set and Myself to rebuild) we had a system for inductees.  They want in, they contact only specific people.  Leaders.  Whichever leader is contacted, they set a task that the inductee MUST complete to be allowed in.In most cases, this task would be made as a Target Kill.  Player Kill rather.  Worked fairly well in the days that followed its institution.  Only got members that were willing to kill.  Willing to make enemies.  We need that Dark side back.Lemme know what you think...Good idea, or am I ranting again? :p"
