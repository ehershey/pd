__Letter "right. here we go - Leviathas tells you:When you get a minute, Shadimar killed me yesterday abusinga bug and got arrested, and he's just on different characters now and killed myguild member.  Then he got 2 murder charges and went linkdead to avoid it. It's just a big pile of shit and I think he needs to be banned.  It's inviolation of the principle of multiplay/pk rules.read nefarious's post on the newbie board."
