__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Cookie to Cookie Mon Jul 15 21:52:57 2002:-----OK, Wraith, Wiz, Nightshade, Whomever reads this... have fun, I worked hard on this.Ok, so here's general stuff about the house I want. I figure it's gonna cost me alot of gold... and I want to make sure the main intrance is locked, if that's not includded in the 75K gold. It will have 9 rooms total, 4 on the bottom floor, 5 on the top. The entrance, and 4 of the top rooms will be locked. One of the top floor rooms is a \"hidden room\" via secret passage, AKA the hidden locked room.  Dining room --> []-[]+ <-- To upstairs                      |Entrance(locked) --> []-[]  <--living room               (First floor)                              --- To Downstairs                              vGuest Bedroom(locked) --> []-[]=-[]  <-- Master Bedroom (locked)                              |   | <-- Hidden Passage   Guest Bedroom(locked) --> []  []  <-- Hidden Room(hidden and locked)                         (Second Floor)If Possible, and I'll pay more for all the \"frills\" if I must, I want a seperate key to unlock the master bedroom than the rest of the house, and I also want the master bedroom lock to be much much harder to \"crack\", if immposible to unlock isn't aloud, than the other rooms. This isn't to say the other rooms should be easy to pick, just that the master bedroom is either imposible to pic, or a whole dang lot harder. Next up...Is it possible to make a \"security system\" for the house? Like, if the lock is \"picked\", I get a tell from a hidden mob in the room saying \"someone is breaking into your house\".? If so, I'll pay 500K just for that piece alone. I know it's possible, Just check out Apu and how he sends tells to you when you leave his \"store\".Now, down to room descriptions...~~First Floor~~*Entrance*You are standing in the entrance of Cookie's home. The simple trimmings are done in an english Oak and wafts a warm sent making you feel warm and cozzy.Obviuous Exits: North, East, Outsmells: Oak with a hint of unknown spice.-----------------------------------------------------*Living Room*As you venture into this wing of the house, you notice a well kept living room with all your usual trimmings. A black-leather armchair, matching full couch, a small end table with an un-opened deck of cards, and an area rug potraying a large, well known group of cookie making elves.Obvious Exits: WestSmells: Leather. A Hint of Oak wafts in from the next room.~Description of ChairAn over-stuffed, black leather chair.~Description of CouchA Full-sized, black leather couch.~Description of endtableSmall, dark, wooden table with pull out drawer. *If they \"open drawer\"   ~ You see a note that's been taped inside. It reads \"Joyful Moo\". *That note is a hint as to the password to get into the secret passage, mentioned later on.----------------------------------------------------*Stair Room*You've ventured deeper into Cookie's house now. Right infront of you leads a circling staircase into the unknown upstairs. The floors creak queitly under the wieght of your feet. The only decoration in this room is a single, large, black and White painting on the eastern wall.Obvious exits: South, WestSmells: Oak and spices.~Description of PaintingON a background of all white, a Cartoon looking male figure in old \"mobster\" like clothing, toating a stylish Tommy-gun poses in black. A small inscription gleems on the golden plaquered on the base of the frame. Perhaps you can read it.  *When they \"read inscription\"    ~ Dedicated forever, MMSS----------------------------------------------------*Dinning Room*The Dining room! A candle lit room spans much deeper than you think the small room would be capable of. The Dining room table is set for 4 people, gleeming silverwear, the finest china, Perhaps they are expecting guests!Obvious exits: EastSmells: Spices and baked bread smells fill the room.----------------------------------------------------~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~~Second Floor~~(Note: All rooms here have doors with locks, except getting into the stair room from downstairs of course. Master bedroom is east, with special lock, mentioned above.)*Stair Room*You stumble up the last of the twisted stairs and enter into the second floor Of the home. You have three doors up here to chose from, all look very similar, with the exception of an etching in the door to your east.Obvious Exits: east, south, west~when they \"look inscription\" * /\\  /\\  /  \\/  \\ /   JRP  \\ \\    &   /  \\  ECH /   \\    /    \\  /     \\/---------------------------------------------------*Guest Bedroom (south)*The room is VERY simple in nature. There are no frills here, but everything someone might need to be comfortable. A simple bid, a dresser and nightstand decorate the room.Obvious Exit: Northsmells: Clean. Everything smells of clean.---------------------------------------------------*Guest Bedroom (West)*This room is a TOTAL WRECK! Pieces of food sit un-eaten on the desk, the bed is mussed, potion bottles lie all about the room, some full, some empty. Books after more spell books lay all over the place as if a tornado had blown through here TWICE.Obvious Exits: EastSmells: The smell of Imp hangs heavily in the room.----------------------------------------------------*Master Bedroom (east)*(Note: Since this is the master bedroom, I think it would be fair to be able to \"relax\" or \"rest\" in here and have it function like a prayer room. I will pay guild fee's if I must for this and the locker thing I will mention soon, if I must.)As you enter, an aura of fantasy seaps deeply into your very soul. The calmness makes goosebumps rise all over your body. The room is lit with hundreds of long, un-dieing candles. These Candles cast dancing shadows over the large canopy bed, a red-oak cabnit, and a tall floor mirror.Obvious Exits: WestSmells: Vanilla, Strawberries, Chocolate, and Roses.~Description of Bed *Dark, read oak spires seem to stretch to the sky above the spansive head and footboard. Pooling White silk flows like waterfalls around the bed, pulled back at the moment by black silk rope.~Description of Cabnit *More red oak lies before you in the form of a massive cabnit. This cabnit's covered in intricate golden designs and scriptures proclaiming love and devotion.  *(Note: I would like to make the cabnit like a locker. \"store blah in cabnit\". If it's not possible, even for $$, let me know... but I think it's fair to be able to keep ONE item in your own house.)~Description of Mirror *The Red-hued mirror gleams brightly in the corner. An Aura of magic seems to permiate from it. When you stare deeply into it, you see that one person you love more than any other in the world standing next to you... you swear you can feel their brush your shoulder before the image fades.---------------------------------------------------*Secret/Hidden Room*(Note: You have to type in \"password happy cow\", the mirror will move aside and let you go south into this room)You've entered a room hidden from the outside world. The rooms swirls with COLORFUL (Note: make that rainbow colored) mists. The rooms seems to have no limits to it's mass.. and as your imagination flows, so does the room. This room is a room of fantasies, anything you dream up becomes the setting you're in. The room begins to shift already as it conforms to your deepest, darkest thoughts.Obvious Exits: NorthSmells: Everything you want to smell drifts your way.---------------------------------------------------Ok... all done. All in all, I can pay up to 2.5 million gold for this house if I HAVE to to have everything I requested. Please take everything into careful consideration and I would appreciate it if it all goes as I inscribbed it. Descriptions, extra's, frills, locks, hidden passage and everything. Thanks Alot.Cookie"
