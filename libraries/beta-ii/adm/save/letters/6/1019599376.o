__Letter "Hiya. Sorry I left like that last night. My computer had a crazy crash that wouldn't let me reboot for a while, and no internet. Took me a couple of hours the next day, today, to get it working again. I didn't want it to seem like I ditched ya or anything. Anyways, sorry once more, and catch you later.Cookie"
