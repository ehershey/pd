__Letter "Yet another surpise. I ended up getting some time online before I left for the trip because my dad had to go back into town to pick up my mom from work. I knew you wouldn't be online, but I was very happy to see I had mail. *smiles happily at Gabriel's singing* You're such a sweetie. :)I got some time to really think about your apartment in the illuminati tower. I've got the main room worked out and I'm assuming you're allowed to have more than one room, so I didn't put a bed in it. But here's what i got so far: Rectangular shaped room, with white marble pillars in a line down either side of the room. On the high dome ceiling is a replica of Michelangelo's Last Judgement. On each of the side walls there are various other paintings from the Renaissance. At the end of the room (directly across from the doorway), the room does not make a perfect rectangle. Instead, there is a large half circle area that encloses that end of the room. This half circle area is nothing but windows, so light pours into the entire room. Also in this area sits a tall statue. I haven't quite decided which one yet, but it will either be Wings of Love by Danel (found on the website www.sculpturegallery.com/search.html) or one that i come up with myself. If I come up with one, it will be two lovers, a nude man and woman, sharing a kiss. The man will be standing behind the woman with his hand on her cheek, turning her face so he can kiss her. And the woman will be turning her head to face the man, and her hand will rest on the man's arm that isreaching to touch her face. Okay, I hope you can picture that. If not, well, too bad. Of course, sunlight from the surrounding windows will pour over the statue and into the room, making this room a very bright room in the daytime. I like it, but I'm worried if you will like it. I hope you don't think it's too artsy, but that was just what immediately came to me when i had decided on the Last Judgement painting on the ceiling. So it's kind of a complete Renaissance theme. If there's anything you don't like, let me know please. This is your room too. I haven't worked on the bedroom yet, but I'll probably have all the nice little details worked out by the time i get back.  :)I hope to see you soon, and I'm gonna miss you SOOOOOOOOOO BAD on my trip!  :(   I don't wanna go! But, I have to, so I guess I'll talk with you when i get back. *Kisses you passionately one last time before leaving for the next 5 days*I already miss you,MichelleHahahaha....i mean Savannah. I don't know why i was thinking Michelle. *bonks self*"
