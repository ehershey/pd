__Letter "What do you think of this... think it really will piss off 90% of the mud? Should I change that to being cultish?I had theories?I'm just trying to understand the theories these guys have been putting out. If they would provide evidence, evidence that couldn't be explained by any other theory, then I'd probably accept their theories.The hard part is getting them to share the evidence. That suprises me, since if they really had proof of these amazing claims, you'd think they would want to prove them instead of telling us to find it ourselves, which so far for me has ended up leading to one BS/pseudoscientific site after another.I think the major difference between what I'm trying to do (being scientific about it) and a religion, is that I'm more than willing to be shown wrong -- you just need to prove it to me.Hmm, come to think of it... and I know this is going to piss off like 90% of the mud... but Set sure is being religious about this, isn't he? Absolutely unwilling to hear anything that might debunk his ideas, and unwilling to share evidence that could be explained more easily by another means...Assuming there is evidence of his claims."
