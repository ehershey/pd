__Letter "Thought about you quite a bit last night...  I couldnt sleep very well.  The strange thing was, I didnt think about anything in particular...  just you.  *shrugs*  I usually think through a whole lot of stuff concerning whatever I'm thinking about.  Anyway...  I got a call from Mark and Tim today.  Mark you know of, but Tim is a guy I used to go to highschool with, and just found out he lives here in Oklahoma.  Havent seen him in a number of years.  So they invited me out tonight to go watch a movie and stuff, so I'll be back pretty late I think.  I'll be back at a reasonable hour tomorrow night, so hopefully I'll see you then if you've gone to bed tonight.  As always, I love you.  Sweet dreams, Jenna.                                        -Your Paul"
