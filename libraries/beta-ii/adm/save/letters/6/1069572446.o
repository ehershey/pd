__Letter "I'll help you code whatever you'd like :)  as far as the feeding goes, it is on both accounts.  If someone is getting xp while they sit there, it's feeding.  By taking turns they're just taking advantage of the 10% bonus that's built in to the party system.  If they're going to take turns they can xp on their own.  *snuggle*  Hopefully I'll see you tomorrow *smooch*             -Paul"
