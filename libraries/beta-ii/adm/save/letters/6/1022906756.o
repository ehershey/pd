__Letter "subhalls in merk are TRIPLE the price for EVERYTHING, subhall consists of a board room and an entrance for any subhall.Portals from and to merk are a big NO, dont put them in in any way shape or form.If a guild wants a scrying pool, you tell them to talk to me. Im handling that one since I designed it and it was supposed to be a secret.I dont know if I got everything in here, you'll get another mail if I left something out.Thanks,                              Wraith ~ No Mercy"
