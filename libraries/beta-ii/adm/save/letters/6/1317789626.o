__Letter "Okay i know your really busy and i hate to bother you with what might seem to be minor but ramona swears she had 12 diamonds and now she has 9. she didn't lose them in the remort because she has plenty of strength and pk isn't on so no one stole them. I know for a fact she had that many cause she was bragging on skype with me cause she had 1 more than me. anyway shes a lil upset she lost them via what she thinks is a bug she doesn't wanna make a big deal about it but frankly if it is a bug and it could happen again i just wanted to let you know and see if you could check into it. sorry to bother you."
