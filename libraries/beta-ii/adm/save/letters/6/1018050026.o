__Letter "I was wondering If you let players give suggestions on things?  I saw a quest race for vampire and have read the help file on it.  The reason im mailing you is, I'm curious if your going to make them from scratch if you have not already done so.I've never played a mud with that race avaliable, but i would love to give a few ideas on combat, special abilities, etc.etc.I love reading all of Anne Rice's Vampire novels.  I have read them all some of them more than a few times.  I'd love to help from the knowledge I've gained from her books.Now i dont know if your interested but my first idea i'd like to throw at you is the first implecations of the race into the game.In Anne Rice's novels the vampire history starts from the mother and father.  It doesnt give clear as to how they were made in the first place.  But i was thinking maybe an imm could start a character who was a vampire, maybe the father per say, and a player choosen by the imm to start a female as the mother.Out of those two people come all the rest of the vampires for the game.  As far as to how a player is chosen for rebirth and what should happen to him/her i'll leave for another time if you so shall want my idea'sPlease write me back wether or not you like my idea.  For some reason im kinda excited that maybe some of my idea's might be a part of a mud.Thanks                         Shinkoro"
