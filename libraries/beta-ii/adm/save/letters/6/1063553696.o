__Letter "I'd really really really like to see something incorporated where people have to 'flee' to escape a battle before they can run away, and their chances of successfully fleeing are basically random, but heavily impacted by level versus level.  I think this is the ultimate balance for people escaping battles too easily, and it gives the super people a chance to actually kill their enemies, without totally locking their enemy in a certain death--they still have the chance of escaping, a low chance if their attacker is godly but still.PLEASE DO THIS.Levi."
