All the mobs are supposed to sit when they are hit with my breathe attack.You breathe POISON towards your enemy!Tiger becomes so badly poisoned, they fall over puking!Tiger finds a place and sits down.You breathe POISON towards your enemy!Kra'toan hunter becomes so badly poisoned, they fall over puking!Kra'toan hunter finds a place and sits down.You breathe POISON towards your enemy!Owlbear becomes so badly poisoned, they fall over puking!Owlbear finds a place and sits down.You breathe POISON towards your enemy!Kra'toan hunter becomes so badly poisoned, they fall over puking!Kra'toan hunter finds a place and sits down.I tested this ability with Smite in the arena on several occassions. He kept getting the message \"You cannot sit in combat.\"The following sequence is what -does- happen, as opposed to above which is what is -supposed- to happen.You breathe POISON towards your enemy!Tiger becomes so badly poisoned, they fall over puking!You breathe POISON towards your enemy!Kra'toan hunter becomes so badly poisoned, they fall over puking!You breathe POISON towards your enemy!Owlbear becomes so badly poisoned, they fall over puking!You breathe POISON towards your enemy!Kra'toan hunter becomes so badly poisoned, they fall over puking!If you could look into this, I'd appreciate it. Maybe you could have my poison give a 1 round para or add in the 'trip' code or whatever, but either way, it's bugged as it is. Thanks, Dab.Smokey"
