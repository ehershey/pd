__Letter "Meh, Prator = Fool.About the demonfire thing. Rubicante has been really getting to me. Everytime I go in the arena and he is on he will come in and immediately start using demonfire+massacre on me. And there isn't anything I can do about it since I am paralyzed almost the entire time. Even if I run away, because I can't hf for two rounds after cure, and paralyze just backfires when he uses demonfire, I am just stuck.Add on to that that we think he is prolly Ashram.And witht eh letter to the editor thing, I didn't mean anything by it. Just pointing out that it is unfortunate that all the imms have alot of IRL stuff at the same time.Had a chance to do another walktrhoug yet? - Prator"
