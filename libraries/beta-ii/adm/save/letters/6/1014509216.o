__Letter "*tackles you* muahahahaa!! meh. i'm so bored.. *sigh* i'm going home to Rochester tonight, i had a really rough time of it last night. i think it finally hit me that i'm not in school anymore. I feel like i'm a complete failure atm. I didn't sleep at all, i called my mother, and had a good chat. So that was a plus.. ANYWAY! the point of this note is to apologize for being all wierd last night and to thank you for being such a good friend to me. it means a lot. "
