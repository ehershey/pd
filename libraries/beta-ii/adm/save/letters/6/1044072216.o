__Letter "01/30/03Well.. two things that have stood out to me today..and so.. like always.. i'll start with the moreamusing one.We got my dog when he was only a puppy from the animalshelter.  He had been abused and hit and was verytimid around men.  Well he just loved me.. I had asoft voice and would never have raised a hand to himfor no reason.  Maybe a year or so after we got him Ihad taught him to walk on a leash, sit, stay, laydown, and fetch a ball (not that im a great teacher..he's just a smart dog and knows what to do for a pieceof turkey or a hotdog :) well.. about the second yearwe had him he got pinned into a corner when we weretrying to get a leash on him.. he reared back to biteme and my lil brother.. we jumped back and i got inthe way of him and my bro.  he  went to bite again andi had to grab his jaw and flip him onto his back.  Ittore me up inside that I had had to be so mean to himand for a long time he wouldnt even come when icalled.  well, now, almost 5 years later we found thatthe meter men had been hitting him with their toolsand he attacked one of them.. this seemed to unleash awild monster within my beautiful canine.  He beganattacking the other dogs.. went after both my motherand my father and this morning my father decided itwas time to get rid of him.  Only problem is.. my dogdoesn't trust my father.. so he tried to bite him.  Mydad was talking about calling animal services when Istopped him and told him to just let me try.  I walkedout there.. petted my dog and got the leash andleashed him.  Know why? my dog trusts me.. he doesn'ttrust another being in this household.. He knows theonly time i've ever had to hurt him was when hedisobeyed me and even then i still loved him.  heknows im the one that fed him -way- too many hotdogswhen my parents werent looking and im the one thatwould never let anything bad happen to him.  I savedhim from going to the animal shelter today bysuggesting that we make him a guard dog for my dad'sbusiness.. that way he can still run around and catchsquirrels.. and even bite the meter man if he wantsto.. cuz then he'll have an excuse :) I want to be like my dog.  Not hairy.. or smelly.. orable to catch birds.. I want to have that someone Ican trust.. even if I have to bite everyone else.. Iwant to have one person.. that when they come to put aleash around my neck.. I don't have to defend myself..I dont ahve to run away and hide.. I can just trustthat no matter what they'll never try to hurt me.  Iwant to know that even if i screw up and disobey theystill love me.  I want someone that is patient enoughto work with me.. train me to what they expect andwant to reward me when I please them (though i dontlike hotdogs)  I want to be just like my dog is to me. He knows me and trusts me but he respects me.. I wantsomeone I know.. I trust.. and most of all.. Irespect.Now that you both think I've gone nuts :) My secondlesson for today comes from something I read oncastlerealm.com.. surrendering -all-  how can isurrender 100% of everything that I am.. when i canteven face 60% of my past?  I have no fear that themaster I choose will dislike me for it or anything.. ijust fear having to relive it myself.  I mean.. Im noteven the slightest bit scared that he can't handleit.. I'm just not sure I can.. if that makes sense.. I feel like.. a little girl.. who just wants someoneto hold her hand and check the closet with monsters..but she knows.. that if she opens the door.. she mighthave to actually come face to face with one of thethings that haunt her dreams.. I'm not ready to evenattempt that.  Another thing is that I have to havemore confidence.. how can i expect another person towant me if i dont even want myself?  but in order toover come that.. i have to over come my past.. andlike I said.. i cant face that right nowso what do i do? i've got no fucking clue.. i'mcompletely lost in my own little circle of chaos andonce again.. I can't bring anyone else into this mess.x.x;Heather"
