__Letter "Well i know i always moan about something :P but anyway youtold me to tell you about vortex when i got there and well..It sucks huge monkey nuts :Ptakes 3 rounds to kill a 16k monster and well, its notmuch different to hellfire at all, Granted it is a LITTLEmore powerful, but the only real noticable difference is thatit kills the monsters After the spellcasting not during itand it doesnt para or use mp if you cast with no monsters presentFor an elite spell this is well, Abysmal it really is, iknow ive complained about a lot but this is sad that a level50's area spell (the ONLY class to get an area spell at elite)and its no different from his level 25 area spellits sad :(Its just been nerfed to extinction and somethin really needsto be done about it because so far all i can see goin for kataans is demonfire,thats it, and it wouldnt take much toimprove vortex, Just make it do a lot more damage oh yeah, and as for mp usage.. It drains twice the amount ashellfire, Or so. so in general its a poor spellPlease Ven, Do something about this because its stupidand you told me you would do something when i first mentionedthis topic.Set"
