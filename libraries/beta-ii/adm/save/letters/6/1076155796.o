__Letter "Dravin was born in the small farming community of Dhedluk in Cormyr. His childhood was a fairly normal one, playing with the other town children, and, when he was old enough, he helped out with chores on the farm. At the age of 14, Dravin got into a fight with one of the other community children over which of them was the better hunter, when Dravin threw the other boy accross the street without so much as touching him. This caused quite a stir in the small community, and the news of the fight and spread like wild fire.That evening a cleric from the local temple of Chauntea paid a visit the farm, to determin if the magic was in the form of the gift of sorcery, or the taint of a demon possesion. The cleric failed to detect the presence of sorcery within the boy and so, assumed that he was demon possesed. Dravin spent the better part of the next two weeks suffering through the various exorcisim rituals of the town cleric, the cleric at last deciding that he couldn't remove the demon taint in Dravin.Dravin was cast out of the community as a broken individual, with nothing but a little food, and the clothes on his back. For the next few weeks, Dravin survived by foraging and catching whatever food he could, putting all the skills he had learnt on the farm to the test. After a few weeks Dravin stumbled upon, or more accuratly was found by an individual by the name of Michael. Michael had heard about the incident at the community from a traveling merchant and had gone in search of Dravin to find out if he was really \"possesed\" or if Dravin had been granted a very rare gift. Michael discovered that Dravin did indeed have a rare gift, Dravin had latent psionic powers, Michael too had psionic powers and thus took it upon himself to look after Dravin and teach him how to control his powers, and how too defend himself, should the need arise. Michael and Dravin traveled together as companions for the next few years, Michael continued to train Dravin in both psychic dicipline and in the basic arts of combat. Michael and Dravin earnt a living by working an escorts for trade convoys, and helping with odd jobs where ever they wandered. Once Michael believed that he had taught Dravin all he could teach, Michael decided it was time to find another to train, and thus Michael and Dravin parted ways. Dravin has been wandering since then in search of a purpose, and in search of ways to better himself."
