__Letter "Heya,I sent you a huge letter earlier explaining my application for a balancing position on the staff.I dunno if you got it or not it bugged on me, but send me a tell or something and I'll gladly resend or send another.Also, I think I'd be good Law, you know that I'm impartial. For instance, despite what my personal feelings on Pyro are, I have defended him when others began to gang up on him (It's true! Check in the logs) and I've acted as mediator time and time again for many disputes.But anyway, I have LPC experiance, and you know I'm good for a position my man.I'll take what I can get to help you but I think I'd be most useful either balancing or Law.-Hermes"
