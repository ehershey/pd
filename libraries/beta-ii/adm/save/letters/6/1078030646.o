__Letter "So...where to start? Well, for the first part he only talked about other things that bothereed him, and he didn't even address the main problem. Then he was ready to go to bed and I made him stay and talk about what we really needed to talk about. He told me how he interpreted things (which I told you), and also said that he felt like I had lost all faith in him and that I should've left him by now (not those words, but that that I wrote to you that he said). Yeah. Then when he was finally done, I told him he had gotten it all wrong. That I didn't feel that way at all. I told him I felt like I was being neglected in this one particular area and I wanted it to change.Then I asked him why he doesn't want to take care of my wants in this particular area, and he responded \"because I fucking hate taking pictures\". Then I asked him why not anything voice chat, and he said it's because he has to constantly be thinking of something to say or do next and it was just stressful. And also that since he did have a good time that night, he suddenly feels like he's obligated to do it again whenever just because he enjoyed it that one night. Other physical related things are just stressful to him. He said he would force himself to do stuff but that I always say that I dont want to force him. But, the fact is, I'm worse off without having this fulfilled. So, we agreed, when I ask him for physical things, he does them, and forces himself to if he has to, just as long as it's not something he hates. I agreed that I didn't want to force him to do pictures, his objection was too strong to that.Yeah that's...the most of it. It really bothered me that he was xping and chatting on pd when I was trying to talk to him, but I didn't want to say anyting because at the time he was pretty upset, andi didn't want to upset him further and make the conversation go even worse. I think I will mention it to him later, but after all this has been taken care of. I feel like it has been, and that it won't come up again. At least I hope so.It was a really rough conversation, but I think we managed to make it through.Now he's gone to bed (I thin, his char is still xping apparently), and hopefully tomorrow we can go back to normal. I'll let you know tomorrow how things go...and I guess Tsuke can still talk to Jon if he wants. Actually I would kind of like him to, just so I can get another point of view to see if Jon's really resolved about this or if there's still things he needs to tell me.He did say that I interpreted his email incorrectly, but that he coudn't think of how to explain it differently, that it was too hard. I wish he would tell me how i misinterpreted it, but he says that it's over with now and it doesn't matter. I hope he's right...Well, one last thing before i g. I'd like o ask you not to use my email address at all--my dad would have a big fuss if he found out about it.Thank you guys so much for talking with me today, it really helped me \"make it\" until Jon and I could talk. I can even describe just how incredibly miserable and sad I was, though I know you have a pretty good idea. Thank you so much, you both are true friends to me.Tsuke, can you let me know how the chat with Jon goes, and just mudmail me if I'm not around? Thanks :)See you tomorrow maybe.Heather"
