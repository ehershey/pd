__Letter "First off, the house.c file's reset() function needs to call ::reset() before doing much else...Secondly, you do new(MOB+\"parent\")->environment(this_object())) ...change the environment to move, that is, ->move(this_object()) .Third, the parent.c file is in fact an early copy of house.c. It inherits ROOM,has no long set, and no IDs, so it would be hard to see even if it did load.So there you go."
