__Letter "hey dabbyfirst off, nice message on the board =)second, you're right about not giving me a job, because as it is so far i can only log on every couple of nights or so, and even then, sometimes i might not be able to log on when you lot are on. being an aussie imm used to be important because of the sheer number of players we had from my town, but now they either all play WoW, or they behave when I'm around (i dunno why)so ideally, since i've almost forgotten all the commands and codes, and so far all i'm doing is providing a lot of history of the players information to Levi, there's not much I can do except be night shift. and even then, only now and theni could go back to coding my area, which was only 1/3 complete, but thats up to youlemme know what you thinkCarmen aka Helena"
