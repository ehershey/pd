__Letter "A woman and a man are involved in a car accident: It's a bad one.  Both cars are totally demolished but amazingly neither of them  are hurt.  After they crawled out of their cars, the woman says,\"So, you're  a man. That's interesting.\" I'm a woman. Wow, just look at our cars!.  There's nothing left, but we're unhurt. This must be a sign from God  that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace for the  rest of our days.\" Flattered, the man replied, \"Oh yes, I agree with  you completely!..\"  \"This must be a sign from God!\" The woman continued. \"And look at  this, here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine  and celebrate our good fortune.  Then she hands the bottle to the man. The man nods his head in  agreement, opens it and drinks half the bottle and then hands it back  to the woman. The woman takes the bottle and immediatelly puts  the cap back on, and hands it back to the man. The man asks,\"Aren't  you having any?. The woman replies, \"No, I think I'll wait for the  police....MORAL OF THE STORY;Women are clever, evil people.  Don't mess with them."
