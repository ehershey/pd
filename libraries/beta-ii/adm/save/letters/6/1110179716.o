__Letter "I was wondering if perhaps one of my characters could get a name change, he's not very well known, there's no real motive behind it.. it's just a really stupid name but i've put a bit of time into himit's not really offensive but every time i log on people make comments about it and it seems to annoy peoplehis name is Splattergore hehe if you will change it, Emmanuel would do just fineIf I get the name change I intend on role-playing with him very much thats why i really want the name changethanks, Dubbya/Mazrim"
