__Letter "Hey,I'd be interested in seeing the log, but I think you should compress it first. A text file of 144mb should compress down to 20mb easy. Anyway, I am very well experienced in setting up things like apache, bind, mysql, etc. so let me know what you need help with... I can install my \"good\" apache/php/mysql for you, if you want, just let me know. I'm usually on aim, so hit me up there.Jason"
