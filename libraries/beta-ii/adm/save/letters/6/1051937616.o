__Letter "Hm. You said it would be about 8:30 i think and it is now 10:30. I still want to spend time with you, but I figure that I could just sleep until you get back. I'm done xping, done talking and all that fun stuff. Now all that remains is for you to return. I will be sure to sleep near the computer and you can just ICQ me when you get back. I'll hear the beep telling me you're here. Until then, I love you.Heather"
