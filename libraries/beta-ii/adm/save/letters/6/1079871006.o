__Letter "Nightshade,Hey, my guild hall....the rooms are not all safe areas...djerr and I were fooling around and I pk'd him in Rhondale, and we didn't truce but then I was giving him his corpse back in the Ethereal hall because I figured it was safe, but the attacks were still going on but he was already at like -hp I guess...anyway he died again and now I'm an outlaw, so could you please remove my last offence? I of course will keep the one in Rhondale, I just want the last one taken care of, off my and his record because i was a mistake, I guess it was sort of a bug in a way, since it occured in an area that we're not supposed to be able to attack eachother in..very strange. Anyway, please! I'm gonna quit out my character cause I'm too scared to keep her connected. I'll make an alt, and call it.. Kumialt so just send a tell to that when it's all cleared. Many thanks! And please if you have a chance make the rooms in ethereal no attack yes yes. Sorry! Oh wait you're not a guild dude. Okay sorry don't worry about ethereal..jut the offences..never mind sorry. OKay let me know!-Kumi"
