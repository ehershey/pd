__Letter "%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ok this was on the tirun board but i didnt want to forget it:%^BOLD%^%^RED%^\"In this area there are a total of 6 XP areas that i am currently %^BOLD%^%^RED%^building.  2 of them are %^BOLD%^%^RED%^small and inside the town area, the other 4 %^BOLD%^%^RED%^are through gates and they will not be for the %^BOLD%^%^RED%^faint hearted.  %^BOLD%^%^RED%^This will be known as the \"Sky Temple\", for those of you that know, I coded the \"eye of hell\" and this more %^BOLD%^%^RED%^\"good natured\" area is being build to off set that. If you like the Inferi Island, you will be %^BOLD%^%^RED%^even happier with this area, as i am now a better coder than i was %^BOLD%^%^RED%^before and have more ideas. %^BOLD%^%^RED%^ if you didnt like inferi island, eh well %^BOLD%^%^RED%^more for those of us that do ;) KIDDIN! if you didnt %^BOLD%^%^RED%^like it, i ask %^BOLD%^%^RED%^you to not discourage, you may like this area as again, better %^BOLD%^%^RED%^coder...more ideas blah blah.\"%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ok with the 2 areas, one is a park...very tranquil and green and heavenly.  The other area is a meditation %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^area with monks..clerics..priests etc... etc...  The entire area is a holy area and it has a feel of heaven %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^to it...in the clouds in its own lil world.  Those are the 2 areas i am workin on finishing now.  I may %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^need help with the other 4 areas that will be for MAJOR XPage, but I want to take it one step at a time, %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^and get the town done before i code the XP areas.  All of the mobs/armour/weapons are built for 3 of the 4 %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^areas, and the last area i will do last.  But if you wish to help on those too, i would be very happy and %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^will let you know when i am workin on them.  If you need anymore details just let me know.  %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^GUIDLINES FOR DESCRIPTIONS:%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^- %^BOLD%^%^RED%^All 3rd person, no \"i\", \"you\" \"your\" etc...	%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^- %^BOLD%^%^RED%^Never tell the player how they should feel while they are in this area.  describe the %^BOLD%^%^RED%^room, not the emotion %^BOLD%^%^RED%^someone would feel.%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^- %^BOLD%^%^RED%^Descriptions must be at least 4 sentences long; UNLESS, there are 3 sentences that are %^BOLD%^%^RED%^long %^BOLD%^%^RED%^and very %^BOLD%^%^RED%^descriptive.%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^thanks for any ideas, descriptions or anything you can give me, even if it is just key words.%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^carina"
