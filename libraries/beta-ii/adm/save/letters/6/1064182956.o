__Letter "I'm trying to use the one brain cell I have left in my head to do that stupid poem....it's so darn hard!!!!!!!!!  I'll keep at it, also, how do you feel about changing the quest this late in the game?  I really would like to keep it the way that we had it, but the code involved would be astronomical, so, I figure we can hide the orbs in the forest part of our quest and they have to find the dragons in the mazes.....once an orb is placed in the statue...all the statues will dissappear, then maybe the one orb you put into the statue, that dragon would appear???  Problems I forsee1. What to do once the dragon appears?2. What if you picked one of the odd colors?3. Will we only do one color dragon in so many days?  Maybe then this way we can change the quest slightly when the color is allowed to be repeated???Is there any other problems that you see with this?Also, if you don't like this idea, you have one that you like to sugguest?I'm thinking that this quest will be in by halloween, if we jump on it...we have the event to do besides this...also fixing the existing abilities the dragons have now.  It is quite do able....one day of wiz being here could sum up the whole dragon quest quite nicely, but I want to make sure we have all the loose ends tied up before I get him here.  He is quite busy, and his girlfriend is a b*tch from hell, so I don't think I'd be able to get him out of the house often.Please respond to this mail, so I know what you are thinking over there, or I'll go crazy sitting here waiting.  Okay thanks"
