__Letter "The fact that your friend is in another guild is not hte main issue, it is simply against my guild policy.The main issue was your abuse of Helena, and before that your continuous and inane babble from yours and Tsuke's tiny argument.I've heard that you also continue to make comments known of your dislike for us. So, since you don't like us, what is the big deal? There are other guilds and it isn't like they have a whole lot of stuff that we don't.Finally, Jacie was very unnappreciative of you putting her in hte middle of this. She is only a member of the guild, not a council or leader, and so is not in a position to ask for re-instatement to the guild. That duty falls to Tsuke and Helena (oops, you pissed them off too much), as well as Ug and Crem. If you want to go past them you can talk to me, but you really didn't try and put forth your side of the story, simply stated that Beherit isn't in Vorticon.%^BOLD%^RED%^<>%^YELLOW%^- %^WHITE%^Aziraphale %^YELLOW%^-%^RED%^<>"
