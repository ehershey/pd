__Letter "I understand not having the backfire on roar, but I watched buddah fight, and he cannot be hit while he faught in drow.  it's my belief that roar should para for a random 1-# amount of rounds, so that you cannot just assume that you have one free action (flameclaw) to do massive damage with.                                  -Nightshade"
