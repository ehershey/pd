__Letter "I'm placing the idea on hold until nulvect talks to me.As per our discussion Saturday night, i was ready to starttoday. Had several hours set aside for it.....Mail me back and let me know if you guys are still interestedin my designing this for the mud or not. Got a few more gemsthat im toying with besides this if you don't. I just feltthat a central store system would have been a major draw forthe mud as well as for our guilds.Please get back to me about it.I'll be in and out today.Ironman"
