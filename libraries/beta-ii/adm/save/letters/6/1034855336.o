__Letter "Ok, I want to clear this up Stormbringer.  Galdur said that I logon the game port often, therefore I should get a promotion.  Now, I toldhim it doesn't matter what happens, that I'm happy at Immortal.  Hesaid that I deserve it, more than Wraith or Whit.  I feel differentlyabout the matter, Whit deserves it more than me.  To sum it all up,Galdur should drop the matter.  It is unprofessional to talk aboutpromotions, and I understand that you make the final decisions aroundhere.  If Galdur continues this discussion, I will have to takeaction."
