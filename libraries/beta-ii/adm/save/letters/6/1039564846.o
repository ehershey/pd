__Letter "Ooooooo....*shivers from pleasure at Gabriel's touch* I'm wonderful today, especially after getting this e-mail....err, mail i mean.I understadn why you left. There was a storm coming and it kept kicking you off the internet (and the MUD). That happens to me all the time. In fact, there was a storm coming that kicked me off right about the same time it kicked you off.I think I can be on every night, about the same time I'm usually on. But in case I don't see you soon I'll just hurry up and try to get to level 20 while you're gone. I just got level 15 today, so it shouldn't be too much longer.And then we'll have some catching up to do... *Savannah kisses you passionately, one hand roaming around your face, the other roaming down to your manhood to squeeze it and massage it gently through your pants.* 'Til next time...*wink*Your hot-for-you woman,Savannah"
