__Letter "forsaken for some reason has 2 \"stone\" type healing items (healers for mp).  I've kept them both in until I know which one to get rid of, as I'm sure you'll probably want.  The problem is, do i just chose? since there are no active members?  My other thing is, are guilds allowed to have \"ointment\" or \"sp\" healers?  The only ones that had working ones were Illuminati, and Last Saints for like a few days.  Do you want to get rid of those or are they allowed?  For the time being I'll put them as not buyable, but will keep them on the buy list until I hear your answer.  As far as balance, everything is inherited OIL or STONE.  They're all balanced with the main oils/stones so they're good to go other than those couple questions from before.Thanks,Amun"
