__Letter "Sorry about that i sent you a tell then had to go back to work..What i was saying was that in your finger info it says \"Married: Rogue\" and there isn't a player named Rogue.. I was just wonderin if that is the name of a player that isn't around anymore or if it was a glitch somewhere..I was just curious...Kelvin"
