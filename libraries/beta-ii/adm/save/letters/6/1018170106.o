__Letter "Hey,Thanks for telling me about the chinchilla, but by the time I hadcalled about it, the guy already sold it. It's alright, since mygirlfriend and I will have to wait until we get our own apartmentto buy a chinchilla. For now we have 3 mice, actually 11 mice now,since one recently gave birth...Anyway, work is keeping me incredibly busy and I barely have timeto do anything lately. How have you been? The mud says you haven'tbeen on for a couple weeks, guess you are busy too... give me acall sometime, if not just to say hi. Talk to you laters...Jason"
