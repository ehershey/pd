__Letter "I'm not contradicting you \"for the fun of it\". - I am trying to show you that what you said is unfair.But because you are so up yourself either you couldn't admit it or you just wouldn't listen.The competition entries were to be mailed, making them private. Eventually Hermes may have posterd them, but since that is in violation of the rules, he either would not have done it or would have removed the posts immediately.It was unfair and, in fact, wrong, to say you cannot hold the contest *at all*. People can do whatever they like in private. %^RESET%^CYAN%^*** %^BOLD%^WHITE%^Prator %^RESET%^CYAN%^***"
