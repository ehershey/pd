__Letter "oknow, yesterday for me.. i say \"sh t\" spent how it is there... over newbie line and daos gagged me. Then he left and i didn't get ungagged... and today after reboot i think.. i could talk but the gag was still in my inventory... and i said that over newbie.. and was saying im the winner and stuff.. like i normally do. and daos said \"Daos <newbie> don't make me gag you again galdur..\" which is a bad thing to say to me. so i auctioned the gag. and daos gagged me 5 seconds after it was up. then noone bid on the gag and when it came back to me it canceled out the other gag and i could talk again.i just thought ya should know that cos im expecting that daos is going to mail you about the same subject."
