__Letter "Right now, I have Perel and Rohl set up to take advantage of DEEZ.If you dont know what DEEZ is, read the ds board, then come backto this mail.Keyword: rasenganSend this in a tell or a say and I will start buffing.But before you can use the keyword, you have to set me up.To do this, 'tell uzamaki nickname'This will prepare me to buff you using my flexible nickname.Step 3: Should I run low on mp, give me a stone and say or tell me'crudbuckets'. I will rub the stone and get the mp back up.This is how DEEZ works.Enjoy!Uza"
