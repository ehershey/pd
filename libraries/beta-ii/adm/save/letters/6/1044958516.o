__Letter "Stormy,I know you're tired of me now.  I bother you so much and give you so much crap that I'm really amazed you haven't gone off at me by now.  A testiment to your patience to be sure.But here is what I consider to be my final suggestion in my long, unending line of suggestions.Unlike my other ideas, this one actually gives you less work instead of more work if you decide to impliment it.Look, I'm not trying to be egotistical, but I'm pretty much three for three on ideas right now.The heal spell, bear, and espically AC adjustment have all been adopted by you. Add the readdition of acid rain and I'd say that I have more god ideas then bad... At least when it comes to the mud.I'm also rather dedicated to this mud and am skilled in C++ and Java.  Plus, I'm learning LPC at a fast clip and to prove it have a brand new spell all play tested for you to put in after balancing is worked out.(This new spell is called Ball and I'll go over it with you tomorrow if you wish.)In any case, if you look in any text book on science, it tells you that one of the most important part in any scientific progress is field tests.Do the guys go out in the field with their goofy glasses and make things blow up? No, they give it to competant field engineers who blow it up for them and then return them the results.You are a very good, and intelligent admin, and a good man in my opinion.  But, even Einstien needed to have his stuff field test and as smart and dedicated as you are, you are only human.Your adjustments have had some problems in the opinion of quite a few people including me.  I point to thornwrack as a pristine example of overadjustment.  It was to powerful at first, now it takes me 17 castings of it to kill a 60k monster at level 50 with max nature, magic attack, and damn high wisdom.And this is just a sample.  On the whole, despite your best efforts, this mud is way underbalanced. Is this your fault? Hell No!You are one man, you have a family, you have a life.And you are devoid of all the data.Hince my solution, what I like to call the Player Perspective.My idea calls for me to become an immortal, the reasoning for this will be made clear in the presentation.Basically I would become Hermes, the mechanical man!I would pick a class, let's pretend I'd pick fighter and Paladin.Then I'd wonder around for the next two weeks playing with it.  I'd XP my way up to around level 50 to level 60  trying out everything about the class.I'd make notes, make out a report, and then present my recommendations to you on what needed to be adjusted.Then, with whatever changes you make, I could adjust the aspects. Or, if you don't want me to you could adjust them and just use my report as a starting point.Now, why immortal?Simple, it drasticly cuts timeMost of the XPing is made up of raising skills and stats, but most espically stas.If I know that an average fighter of level 30 has around 40-50 in stats, do I want to spend a week trying to raise my stats up as this is a week I could be doing other, more productive things? No.  I would make the call and change my stats (I know what you're thinking, but Wraith had a suggestion on this part which will be made clear soon.)The most important thing is I would be your field engineer! If you had something to test, then I would do it.  If you had a change to make, I would help you work out the bugs.Remember when AC was changed and at first no monsters anywhere did any sort of damage whatsoever? Well, with a playtester, that problem could have been quickly isolated and solved (In fact, if you'll ask Daos, I'm the first one who alerted him to the fact that the monsters were dealing out 10 damage when they should be doing 150)And as ball proves, I could also make new spells and with your approval, begin to enhance the mud.  instead of writing new areas like everyone else, I could be adding new abilities, new spells, hell maybe even new classes or subclasses?Although that would be a secondary function at most, the primary function would be to help *you* balance.I wouldn't be a maverick doing what I pleased, I would be directly under your leadership, as well as any of the other Admins or Immortals here.If I'm not performing to you satisfaction, then just smack my butt back to player and tell me that I'm dumber then a retarded monkey.I'll be on later tomorrow if you wish to discuss this further.  I honostly think that I could help the game out this way... And I'd still be doing the newspaper, of course (Another good idea of mine)I talked to Daos and Wraith about this and I'm pasting their conversation now.  It's verbatem, some of the stuff that didn't releate to the topic at hand was taken out but other then that...Daos says: Stormbringer may want to balance it out more.Daos says: Hell, that's up to him.You nod solemnly.You say: I respect Stormy, I really do.You say: But some of his balance decisions don't really jive with me.You shrug helplessly.You say: I think I'd make a great balancer, I mean it was my idea about the entire AC adjustment thing.You say: And if I was an immortal I would most likely go around playing a class with average skills/stats and see what needed adjusting.You say: For instance, I played a pyromancer up to level 20.  Most of his spells are horrid.You say: He needs a bad adjustmentDaos nods solemnly.You say: And for DruidsDaos says: Wanderers are also pretty fucked.You say: Sandcone is a worthless spell for usYou say: By the time I get it, my bolt does more damageDaos says: Gypsys are fine, the rest need balancing.You say: And by the time that sandcone surpasses bolt in damage, I have thornwrack.You say: I know Druids are supposed to be good early on then peeter out later.  But I'm pretty much the only druid to make it to elite and I can tell you it's been a *long* climb.You say: When it takes you five castings of thornwrack to kill a 20k mob at level 49, then you spend a week getting to 50 almostDaos says: Hermes, if you were to make Immortal you would still be under Stormbringer's say under balance of spells/skills.You nod solemnly.You say: Of course.Daos says: We don't always agree with him, he is the final say.You say: I'm not going to go around being a Maverick and adjusting stuff without any saysoYou say: I'd gather a report, give it to him and anyone else who wants itYou say: And with his permission, make the adjustments or if he wants, let him make the adjustments.  Just so I'm doing *something* to help.You say: That would take a huge load off of him in my opinion.Daos nods solemnly.You shrug helplessly.You ask: Can you see my point?Daos nods solemnly.Daos says: Do you like what NS has done with ac?You nod solemnly.You say: I do indeed.You say: It's exactly like I had invisioned it.Daos says: That has several advantages/disadvantages per-se.Daos says: For every class.You say: Of courseYou say: But I'm not talking about making huge adjustments like NS did... I'm talking about adjusting firebomb, or liquifyYou say: AnywayYou ask: If I went to Stormy with my idea, could I say you thought it was a good idea?Daos nods solemnly.You say: I want to see what Wraith thinks. And if he likes it I'll present it to Stormy tomorrow.You tell Wraith: YoYou tell Wraith: I've been talking with DaosWraith replies: supYou tell Wraith: He thinks the idea of me being an immortal balancer is a goodone.  Lemme tell you the specifics and see what you thinkYou tell Wraith: Basically I'd be an immortal. But I'd add what Stormy ismissing, a player perspective.  I'd become a class, and with my immortalstatus I would XP and play it, making notes at what I thought neededadjusting. Then I'd give it to Stormy for the nod and then adjust itYou tell Wraith: Stormy is a great guy, don't get me wrong, but he doesn'thave the perspective that I do, as a player, from the year I've been on PD.Wraith replies: In that case, we should give balance to a more experiencedplayer, like say faust, or ashramYou reply to Wraith: Maybe... But I also have ideas that they don't.  I.E. TheAC adjustment.Wraith replies: those can be passed onYou reply to Wraith: Do you think Faust or Ashram would be as unbiased as Iam?You reply to Wraith: Do they want that sort of job?Wraith replies: 2/3 of the balance in the game since ashram left were hisformulasYou reply to Wraith: This game needs balance. Don't tell me itdoesn't. Now Stormy is excellent, hell I consider him a buddy, but he doesn't have the pespective I do and I'm willing to make an effort.Wraith replies: lol, it does, and stormie is going through everything, one byoneYou reply to Wraith: If you think Faust would be a better idea and he waswilling to do it, then I say go for itYou reply to Wraith: Like I said before, Stormy is good but he doesn't havethe perspective that players do.Wraith replies: Ok then, What would you change on things that have beenbalanced alreadyYou reply to Wraith: I don't have any ideas yet.  Like I said, what I would dois pick a class/subclass then build a character to a level of x.  I would makea report and present it to Stormy of things that I think need adjusting. Andwith his approval/changes I would make them thus allevating him of most mudanework.Wraith tells you: how about you start makin characters, testing them to lvl 60with 75 in statsreply I really need to be an immortal.  As it would take to long to make a report if I had to, say, spend time xping to raise stats to what would be an average amountYou reply to Wraith: And I really need to be an immortal.  As it would take tolong to make a report if I had to, say, spend time xping to raise stats towhat would be an average amountYou reply to Wraith: Dude, come on.  I'm trying to help the Mud and I wantyour support so Stormy might actually say yes.You reply to Wraith: You know my ideas are good.Wraith replies: im iffy on it, stormie has his own ideas on what should bebalanced and what should be changedYou reply to Wraith: But that's the thing. He'd have all say.  I'd just givehim a report and let him change it as will.  That's certainly better then himdoing all these random adjustments.  I'm not the only one to think so either.Many have observed that when a skill gets adjusted it either becomes way buffor is overnerfedYou reply to Wraith: I.E. ThornwrackYou reply to Wraith: Or SwipeYou reply to Wraith: But that's not my point.  What is my point is that asgood as Stormy is, he lacks the perception of a player and that adequates tomistakes.  Even Einstien can't make a nuke unless he has someone to field testvarious firing pins for him.Wraith replies: lmaoYou reply to Wraith: I'm just using that to illustrate my point.  Scientificprogress involves field work, and that involves mundane tasks that shouldn'tbe done by an admin.Wraith replies: present your idea to stormie, but I dun want you callin yourplayer without another imm/admin online with youYou reply to Wraith: If I was willing to accept those terms, would you bewilling to support my idea?Wraith replies: I wont hack it, if thats what yer askinAnyway Stormy, I have Daos's backup, and at least Wraith's grudging approval.  That counts for something, eh?So I'm looking forward to your responce, thinks for reading this overly long peice of crap.  I look forward to your reply.-Hermes"
