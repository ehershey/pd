__Letter "I changed a lot here.  It's all the same, just worded a lot differently.  No pressure to use it, but it might fit.Sreath saw evil.  It invadeded and consumed him in a flame of hatred.  Robbing him of his essence, it demanded blood and hungered for a reward that would be paid in the same.  But, the spirit was strong and the battle was fought within his immortal soul.  In the end, the spirit won, but not without cost.  It had become warped and twisted. It was something no longer good or pacifisic or peaceful.  It was scared, it was vengeful.  It had destroyed him, much as the hatred had intended.  His own spirit betrayed the very body that harbored it and the shell was lost.  Discarding it for something more powerful, the spirit was able to dispense the righteousness and judgement it demanded.  White scales replaced skin.  Horns replaced hair.  Talons replaced hands.  The ultimate form of retribution was born to destroy the wicked, and it would.  A low growl was heard followed by an splitting roar."
