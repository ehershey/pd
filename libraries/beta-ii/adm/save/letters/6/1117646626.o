They are looking for website integration with possible javascript, form relays, frames, and maybe you can think of some fun animation for them to use as an intro peice. My boss wants to see some of your other work, i told her that you had worked on some other sites for companies and friends. Send those over or CALL ME!!! this could possibly be some big money for a while for you man, better then working at mcdonalds.I am one of your referances within this company, might need a few more, i could include tommy on those, but will need a list of sites youve made, a list of web based programming that you know, and so on and so forth.
