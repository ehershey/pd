__Letter "My post had not much to do with what was said over newbie, I do not know the whole story. As for the removal of your character, that was done for how you treated a staff member and had nothing to do with fair treatment. A gag is nothing compaired to ridding yet you seem to take it as a personal vendeta against you. I am here to tell you I have had it with all troublesome players. I am past gaging and into ridding. I will make this mud a pleasent experience for me and the rest of the staff one way or another. I will speak with Daos about how he treats his friends and I suggest you check your attitude when you log on or you could find yourself not welcome here, speaking your mind is one thing, cussing out a staff member is quite another, You know, as well as I do, no other mud would put up with it for one second, you would be banished for life for doing what you did. I am restoring kenjiru because I said I would but know that I will not accept any other trouble from you.Stormy"
