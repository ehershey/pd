__Letter "I just have a question....why is it that when a character sucides or remorts they ALL OF A SUDDEN get their character back?  This seems to be a new thing, b/c when I started that was not even heard of.  I do NOT think it is fair for us players who work hard and do the things we do and get to where we are.  If a player remorts or suicides that is thier decidion and they should not be put back to thier old chars. b/c they feel they made a mistake.   That is just my thoughts and question.Thank you.Carina"
