__Letter "Rage still tries to use whirl, and whirl was changed so lower levels don't get it anymore, so it says What? or whatever.  Maybe that can be fixed?  When I rage a battle with a 25k I can normally easy kill, to see how many rounds with rage, and the first 4 rounds say What? that's rediculous."
