__Letter "I feel Taruan needs to be repremanded in some sort of way.  If I am not mistaken, in the rules it says something about not making derogatory remoarks or somehting to that effect about players; yet, he has been calling people \"fags\" and \"fat b1tches\" and \"fattie\". EX: Tauran <hm> here fattie fattie; Tauran <hm> lol, cenn is a homo you fat @@##; Tauran <hm> no, im not, just gonna wait 2 weeks then pk the @@#! out of carinaand you and ur guild; Tauran <newbie> rueznor go blow ur dad.  All of this and much more.  Is this not against the rules?  I am sorry, but I am tired of Tauran being able to say what he wants, when he wants...and then gets away with it.If I am wrong...then fine...but i am certain that I am not.  He needs to be stopped, in whatever way..Thank you.Carina/Goldenberry"
