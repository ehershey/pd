__Letter "I didnt give it to them...  I tell them the same thing I tell the rest of the guilds.  I dont do guild stuff.  If I ever do take over guilds, I'm just going to take out all the custom eq cause I think none of it is balanced/fair.  I dont see why someone has to be in a guild just to get some of the cool eq in the game I think it should be available to everyone.  so there's MY rant ;)"
