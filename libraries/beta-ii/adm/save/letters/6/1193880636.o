__Letter "Hey love, how's your day going? Mine is pretty good. Did well ona test in moral philosophy and a test in sociology. Getting backon track and junk. :) Hopefully, everything went well for youtoday. I gotta figure out plans to revitalize Darksoul as mostpeople seem to be flocking to Last Saints and Forsaken lately.Ideas are always appreciated, but more than that, is yourpresence. :) I hope to bask in it soon. :DYours,Esc"
