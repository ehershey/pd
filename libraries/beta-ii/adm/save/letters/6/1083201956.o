__Letter "What better immortal to throw an idea at than one who asks for it. :)I have a complaint about the pyro spell Firebomb. I love the spell except for the fact that it cost money to cast it. I have to spend around 20,000 gold on quickenings in order to gain just a few million EXP. Anyway this is an idea I have to improve it.Instead of using alcohol would it be permissible to use already learned spells? Example syntax: <firebomb with burn>. Basically have firebomb turn a normal pyro spell into a room attack. To balance it out maybe weaken the spells when used with firebomb, or have it possible only with certain spells. (Although all my spells, except firebomb, seem to cause the same amount of damage)Would that give pyros too powerfull of an attack? Oh well, no harm in me asking about it.Just out of curiosity are there other abilities/spells that cost money?Thanks-Keirith"
