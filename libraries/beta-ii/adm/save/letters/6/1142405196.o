__Letter "Just need to learn to chill, if it's stress from an outside source, try and eliminate it before you meet up with your girl.  If it is your girl, let her know what bugs you.  Tell her what she can do to help you warm up to the idea, but don't make her feel that she is the problem.  If I read it right, it's you that is feeling eh, not her, but she can sure help you.If you are embarrassed to tell her, than I sugguest to get un-embarrassed because if you two are to be married, sex takes on a whole new meaning, and I don't mean babies either.  For some reason relationships takes on many stages, it could have been that you moved onto the next stage....."
