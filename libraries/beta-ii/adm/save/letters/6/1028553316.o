__Letter "Yo, I just about have caught up from when I died again. Shesh, dieing powerful is a bitch!In anycase, I have decided to max magic defense, attack, double wielding, and blade.  After that, I'm counting on You to get me some Diamond Bladed Longswords as I've been told by people in the know they are better for idle combat then Starscreams.  I think Wisp could fly you to the battlefields... I would help, but I'm still to weakWhen I get my Dex up to about 60 and Char up to 50, I'm gonna start XPing in the Forbidden Forest with youI figure rage + Holyfire is not a bad combination.  And since holyfire only hits those who I'm attacking, I don't have to worry about it hitting the wolf master should he wonder inHow're things coming along with you and Libby?  How are things coming along?Bah, I need to get some sleep.-Nate"
