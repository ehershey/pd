__Letter "I still need some help from you if you ever get the time.  I dont have any immortals who have ever coded on a mud that had an arena.  If i atleast had someone who has seen how an arena works and looked at what i have maybe I could get a better picture on what I needed to do.  I have an immortal rank called ambassador that allows an immortal only read access to all files in the root directory.  Maybe you could make a character and I'd make it an ambassador.  I running out of options.  If I do nothing else to help this mud an arena is the one thing I want to contribute.  Please give me a hand.Samson on Zynna"
