__Letter "Leviathas: I'm temorarily...  not playing PD.pd808wildflower: how come?Leviathas: I got in a fight with Seeker...pd808wildflower: over what?Leviathas: about how wiz idles all day and he's an admin, and wraith and whit work a lot but they're just imms.pd808wildflower: you know pd is on wiz's box?Leviathas: yea, but that's a dumb reason to let him be an adminLeviathas: I told him I'd be willing to donate 10 bucks a month to get pd put on one of those pay hostsLeviathas: so we're not just throwing admin positions around to whoever can host for freepd808wildflower: because it's on wiz's box, if the mud crashes and doesn't fix itself and reboot, Seeker even though he's an admin can not connect to the box.  Wiz, being an admis will be able to connect to the box and reboot the mudLeviathas: so why doesn't he have an emergency admin character?pd808wildflower: it happened yesterday, whit did something and crashed the mud and stormbringer couldn't reboot it...so I had to call wiz to get him to connect to his box and fix itLeviathas: it's just the fact that wiz gets a higher position for the whole world to see when other people work 1000 times harderpd808wildflower: I don't want to argue with you, it was put this way because the box is here in hawaii, and someone needs to be able to acess it to reboot the mudLeviathas: Ok and I agree with that, but it sends out a bad message when he's allowed to let that particular character idle all day.pd808wildflower: would it help if he went invis?Leviathas: it would help if he had his chatting char and an emergency admin that could sign on to fix shit"
