__Letter "It has come to my attention that furiae has accused damien of multiplaying by transfering guild information from sinan in last saints to damien in darksouls, this is not what has happened. The transfer of information was from sinan in last saints to rohl in darksouls. if you have any questions about this or need any  more clarification i am available at your leisure.Thanks.Damien"
