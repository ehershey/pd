__Letter "Hi Bringer,I writing this mudmail just to put the idea in logical topis, im not forcingyou in anyway, ok?The startGlobal messages goes around the mud creating the espectative- The sun disappear behind heavy clouds.- You hear thunder from distance- Start to rain heavily like the diluvian daysThis will be casting for days. Maybe players will start to ask \"What different will happen?\"The eclipse and the arriveAll mud shows a message of an eclipse, maybe reduce by 1 the global light of mud.Im not sure if PD has this feature.- An black coach pulled by horses with bone bridals and stuff IS at Tirun square.No coach driver is there. The coach is locked and through the small windows younotice nothing except it is compleatly full of dirt. You feel... fear. Maybecreate some area spell to pull the players out from square in a random time.- The coach will stay there for some days.- Maybe players will think \"Yes. Something special will happen.\"The strange facts- Make a mob at tirun square: a woman (robot), farmer, crying and cursing the coach.Blaming the thing for the death of some animals (not human victim)- Still is raining and dark.- Create others mobs saying some strange tales: \"I heard the monster can transformhim self in a dog\" - Maybe an old man at Lars bar.The attackAt some good day with some players connected the coach doors will be open, the dirtpoured at floor with some step marks on it.Lord Vampire will be looking for his victim. Justa cast some cool message at mudof a fight at distance. The lord found Mortis. She screams for help. Players willsearch for her... no chance. When found her, she is dead. My char will be deleted.Make her cold and pale body (mud object, please with red hairs) at hopspital ormorgue. This will not decay... it has the marks at neck.The coach gone, the dirt carefully collected. An note is left at fountain:\"Thank you tirunians for the excelent blood quality. Not i can continue mytravel until my final destiny. See you at next eclipse.\" - Just an idea.The finalNow is let the thing grow up. Players will have a new wave of excitationand the rumours will fly through the net. Im really curious if the connectionwill raise up. Or maybe not. The muds time gone... now what is giving thecards are the online graphics mmorpgs... sadly.Kisses,-MM-"
