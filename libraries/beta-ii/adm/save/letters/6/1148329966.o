__Letter "You and I should team up and start pking mother fuckers. The way I see it, Zubaida, Endbringer, and Pestilence are all main targets on my radar. The pk in the guild has slipped. I don't kill much because my major attack takes 2 rounds to get off, but that's why I recommend we team up. I don't think that we know eachother all that well, and it would probably be in good interest since we are the 2 highest ranks in the guild.Smokey"
