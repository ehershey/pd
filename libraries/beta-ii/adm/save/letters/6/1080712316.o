At first I thought it was you, but then I was like wtf but why? Then it was obvious it was newbie cause he was asking where the wanderer hall and stuff. Just, *shrugs* very weird. It's gonna be too hard to get used to having two blits/z s around. :pOh yeah and where were you today? You weren't on at all during your usual times. *tsktsk* :p"
