__Letter " Greetings Daos, as requested, the ideas of sharpening and weapons conditions will be sent to you. The idea was borned out from simple observation. Sometimes during battle here in primal darkness one notices by information that \" u notice some wear on your (weapon)\". If such a thing occur it should also mean that the weapon one uses gets in worse shape and should also do less damage if the wielder do not take care of the weapon and take it to a smithy. What does that mean in more practical terms? Well it means a weapon should be considered to have different type of conditions according to the wielders interpretation. Maybe 6 main life stages of a weapon can occur. It is up to the coders choice. For example a weapon can be of following condition ( just examples)1) Excellent condition2) Good condition3) Slightly worn down4) Heavily worn down by battle5) Is in big need of repair6) Will break very soonOne of the above description is noticed in the bottom of the weaponsdescription when one do examine weapon.An excellent condition weapon will naturally do more damage then sametype of weapon in good condition for example 90-95 % maybe. I would saythat the down grade from 1-3 should not be too much on the damageotherwise people will probably just be real pissed.Will break very soon means if the wielder does not sharpen it real soonthe weapon will break. There are of course unnatural magical weaponsin the realms as well. Weapons that will not worn down. But it is yourchoice what to do and what weapons should be considered that can notworn down.What does this do?Well it makes fighters take care of their weapons. It is a realistic idea.Those fighters who have sharpen as ability will find it more useful sincethey know they must take care of their weapon now. Also it gives thewielder an idea of when it is time to sharpen.Hope you like the idea, I am very sure of that it will be appreciatedand hope it does not take too much coding time to create it.Yours respectfully,Bahamut Uth Matar."
