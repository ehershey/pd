__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Cookie to Cookie Fri Aug  9 18:43:42 2002:-----All right. I tried. I tried to get everything to all simmer down. I tried to be nice, I tried to let it all fall away and to let tempers settle down, but you have some HUGE stick up your damn ass and won't get off it. While I was talking to you on the mud, you accuse me of looking at \"13 year old girls\". Fuck you Faggot. I don't look at that shit and anyone who's seen what \"porn\" I really do have knows I don't look at that shit. You wouldn't know, cause you don't know me, and you just assume stupid shit because you don't really know. Maybe it makes you feel good to act like an Ass hole. That's right, I called you an ass hole. What else would I call someone who was taken in by someone (Mike), out of total kindness... and you did nothing but fuck up his apartment, bitch about him laying down some rules and wanting you to pay him a little for the use of his apartment, you ate all his food, and still fucked him out of 1400 dollars split among all of you and don't have anything better to say about him than..\"I wanted to kick Mike's ass so bad\". Then you tell me that my joke, THOUGH TAKEN IN POOR TASTE (Focus on that there, I told you that several times in my first e-mails to you and to Mark. I didn't just go and start randomly groping your girlfriend.) and you saying and confronting me saying that I wasn't supposed to \"read into\" what you said, and that you ment exactly what you were saying in giving me a warning and that you didn't appreciate it. I respected that man. Alot. That was handled maturely, and the given threat of \"if it happens again, though I don't think it will and it will end here\" was fair. Then you flip around months later and bring it all back up like you were board some day and hadn't gotten enough agression out in a while and just happened to find me to pick on. What I did to Rachel was wrong. I admit that. I also have appologized MANY times now and you continue to do nothing more than bitch, whine, and threaten me. What do you really gain from all this? Seriously? Does it make you feel good? Make you feel more \"manly\"? I said I was sorry. I said what I did was wrong. I tried to believe that I could take your word and leave it all behind us and move on. I thought I had nothing \"sore\" between me, you, Rachel, and Mark. We are all friends of Paul, so this stupid shit is gonna make things difficult when he gets back in town. What more do you want from me man? Besides you immediate \"I want to meet you somewhere so I can kick your ass\" comments? What the hell more do you want me to do here to make this better? I tried everything I could think of. Either you or Mark brought this back up, and I only wanted to find out what the hell was up and why it came back to the surface after is was all supposedly done and over.I want it to be known that I appologize yet AGAIN to you, for all the shit that's gone on between me and you. I appologize to Rachel AGAIN for the incident happening in the first place, and I wish only that she had told me herself that it wasn't appreciated when it happened. And I appologize to Mark if anything I've said has offended him. Out of you all, he's the one I got along best with. He wasn't always fighting and all that and was cool when we'd go cruisn around at nights. I guess me tryin' to be nice to everyone has come back to bite me because I fucked up once. Had I done a bunch of shit maybe I would think all this was worth it... but since I didn't, I think you're just way to high-strung here and I'm gonna let it pass over me and not worry about it. Knowing you, you will take that as a \"yea, he's scared and just doesn't want me to kick his ass\" action. Whatever man. I'm not afraid of you, but I don't control you, nor what you think. So think all you want, whatever you want. Makes no difference to me.Bye for now,         Ryan"
