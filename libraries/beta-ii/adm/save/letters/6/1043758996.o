__Letter "Hi, hmmmm where do i start....Well you know i started playing on Aka, and met Sadist/Dregs/Davyn there.  Well one day we were in the [] and a player called Justin started to talk to Sadist and we were invited to his place.  Justin told me to go to the kitchen to get them something to drink so i did, and came back out and kneeled as i served.  Occassionally he (Justin) would page me and talk or come to the marketplace if i was there and feed me.  i really thought nothing of it.  Anyway then Sadist and Justin got dested from Aka and i followed Sadist to Shang where he was known as Kazim.  Justin became Joshua and we were all pretty much friends.  Kazim had to go away for 2 months so he gave her to Joshua to look after, so i was under the care of Joshua, he asked me to do things like serve drinks and food, remove his boots and massage his feet, even bathe him once or twice and he would comfort me when i was sad.  Not sexually, but in that time i was with him i was so content, and i realized that is what was missing from Ricks and my and Kazim's and my relationships.  The relationships were wonderful but i felt like i was just some kinky toy, not a real person.Anyway one day, Joshua asked if i was happy there, i said yes.  He said i didn't need to be trained as a slave because it just came naturally, but he wanted to train me as his personal slave and when Kazim came back, it was up to me to decide what i wanted, and that he would just enjoy training me because i had qualities he had not seen in others that he'd tried to train.  My rules were, that i gave him my total attention when he was online, that if i wanted to play with others sexually i had to ask, that i did a first kneel on seeing him the first time of the day and i did a daily report.  He was loving, attentive, use to joke with me about pulling the reigns in tighter because i didn't struggle or have the problems other slaves had.  Anyway Kazim came back, i asked to be released to continue training under Joshua.  I don't take a collar with out alot of consideration, and neither does Joshua, and i'm still not technically collared to him but in training.About mid November Joshua disappeared without a word, i was devistated, i waited and waited for him, other plays told me he'd abandoned me and i just wouldn't believe it, 6 weeks later he came back, i was so happy, i saw him for 2 days and then he disappeared again for another 2 weeks and i didn't do some of my daily reports.  I mailed him and told him i was going to be on holidays and when i came back he was back, for the first night he was wonderful, then the next day he went off because i didn't do my daily report.  Now i know he's very strict, straight down the line, you either obey or you don't.  Anyway he punished me, and ignored me a little bit, though i've seen him do it with other slaves.  He seemed different with me though, others he would send away and not have anything to do with them, me i was made to be involved with his rp, even when he was being nasty he would have to touch me.  It's been rough, but i made a commitment as his slave and i'm going to keep my end of the bargin."
