__Letter "Stormy, when you get time (though I'm sure it's in your plans) could you please take a look at white dragons? Faithwing is cool and all but the only things that seperate me from a blue dragon is 1)my corrupt to blue rot and 2)i have peace and of course the breath difference. I see black dragons are on the right track and I'm sure it's in your plans. And I know I'm only level 36, I'm not asking for a huge ability, because honestly with raising my wisdom faithwing seems pretty good. If you need any input, I've played Buddah to level 50 (red dragon about 2-3 years back), I have Fuel (level 25 black dragon) and of course a white. I made a blue, and my roommate made 4 (one of each) but has since stopped playing. If possible, could you get me a list of possible dragon names created? If not, I understand perfectly. Anyway, to make a long story short, I feel I could be a good resource of information when coming to dragons and how they could be improved. Thanks for your time.Smokey"
