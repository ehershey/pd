__Letter "I've been talking with bahamut about the rage bug a bit and have managed to track down what's been going on with it.  He noticed that it only happened in helgrath (the tundra section), and so I figured it has something to do with the mobs there.  After looking at the mobs, I noticed it was odd that in the set_name() color was being set.  I then figured that your new rage was probably using query_name() to build the attack command, which it was ;)  So I'd stick with either setting all the mobs names in the tundra to the same as one of their IDs, or modify rage to pick one of the unique IDs of the mob, since you wont have to worry about color code being in an ID.  Anyway, so that's why his abilities never work since he's trying to <slash % ^WHITE% ^white bear> for instance."
