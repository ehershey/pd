__Letter "hey azire, Just wanted to say thanx for being cool to a newbie. Unfortunately I'm choosing not to mud here for a while or forever. I just took an action from an evil char personally  . I don't need that kind of crap in my life. So I just wanted to say my goodbye before I leave and thanx for being a compassionate person you are. Rock on, Sano."
