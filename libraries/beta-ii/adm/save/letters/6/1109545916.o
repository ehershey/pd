__Letter "hi, Trev and I were heading out on his way through Ottawa. I needed info fromyou, but he couldn't wait any longer and had to leave for there. I'm leavingVancouver tomorrow for home, I don't have enough money to stay hereand was hoping to catch up with you beforehand. I needed some directionsin your state, etc. There's nothing I can do and I know you're busy withwork, etc. I am able to use a computer, but that's it until I get home.Check your SM mail too when it's back up. Miss ya :(xoxo"
