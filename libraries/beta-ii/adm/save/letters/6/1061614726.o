__Letter "I read your post about wanting to do some hardcore coding.  I had an idea for a balance system completely based on related numbers and characteristics, so for example you'd give 100 points to each subclass, and then divide them amongst the characteristics based on how good they were in each field.  They'd all add up to 100, making them technically 'balanced' (though I'm not sure that this would work in actual gameplay, it seems to work in theory.  So I just thought I'd put it on the table.) I posted this on the board from the last version with little success.  What I was doing was having people submit the numbers that they thought were good for each sub, so I could get averages and then no player could complain about balance when they decided it for themselves, but the few who did participate only submitted numbers for a few subs--so maybe make it a staff vote?Levi"
