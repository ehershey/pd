__Letter "We are desperately in need of more active and visible admins. I love this mud and its going bad with no authority on much, no one to really enforce the rules. I can think of a couple people who would do great as an admin or immy, and many many players in the mud would support me on it, and have. Nulvect for admin, many players think he would work very ahrd to live up to it and do well. Carina for immortal as well, she has shown she can code decently well, and she does work hard. We would just like to see more authority online and active, as i have seen MANY rules broken lately, and people don't listen when warned about it.The other issue is spade, and his brother plague. Plague was just banned, and because they both live in the same place, that leaves spade banned as well. Spade is a hell of a good player, and he hasn't caused too much trouble. He works hard and mostly follows the rules, more so than many ive seen online lately. Another player with decent coding skill and knowledge of lpc is ironman, he has the free time usually to work away pretty ahrd as well.Please take the time to consider what I have written, and thank you for taking the time to read through this jumbled mess.Resolution"
