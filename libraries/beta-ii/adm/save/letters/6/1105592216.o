__Letter "I am for me and I am for you,For each of us do what we must do,Search and riddle and sing and fight,To seek and end the riddle of the night.You are for me and you are for you,Yet now where are you going to,The crazed puppet master works the strings,The bell of the doomed down often rings.We are for me and we are for you,Hush now and cease your sight,For I am hidden in the best manner known,Right before your salivating eyes.The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
__Undeleted ({"carina",})
