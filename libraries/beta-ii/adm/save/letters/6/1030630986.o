__Letter "Ok, what I called childish was ciding characters over a debate on the board, which is what I was told by Wraith and some others you did. I do not think your views or opinions are childish and never would. I consider you a freind and when my Law Dawg comes to me and says \"Faust cided everything because he is mad that death is getting reduced.\" I tend to think it a childish act. Sorry if I offended you and I do not consider you childish, only the act that I was told you did. That is what I get for listening to anyone but the source, won't happen again bub. I apologize to you and know Faust is restored. Wraith didn't even tell me you were arrested, he just said you cided.... so when I fingered Faust I got a little down....if you know what I mean.Thanks for the explaination.StormyStormy"
