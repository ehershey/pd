__Letter "I'd like to look over your area and get it as ready as I canto be put in, but we both have to be around. Evenings PST arethe only times I have enough time available all at once,or perhaps sometime on a friday.I know you keep trying to get ahold of me during mornings PST,but if I'm around at all it's not for very long.Friday morning I should be around though."
