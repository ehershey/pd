__Letter "Last night I attempted to study Dimidium.  I always check to make sure it's cutting xp from me so I know I'm learning.  There were no xp cuts.  I attempted to learn other languages, and again no xp cuts.  I let it sit studying Taurosian overnight, it said I was studying, yet no xp cut, and when I came back this morning, there was no change in the amount of xp I have, and no change in the status of how much I've learned in Taurosian.  I have my int at 55, so I'm assuming that isn't an issue.  Could you please let me know why it isn't teaching me?-jen"
