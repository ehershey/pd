__Letter "In 5 minutes of exping using the ability stab, i broke 3 wolf claws.In 45minuts of exping using only backstab, i did not break a single dagger.Just a suggestion. When a dagger breaks, seeing as were stabbing it would be inside them, so at the point of break, dealing extra damage would be cool.All i have to report for now, Thank you for your time reading it."
