__Letter "Thanks for thinking of me, at the moment just a small thing like that means alot.  My life is fairly crappy too.  Just problems with my kids, money, my job, my monitor shit itself and so did my car battery.  At the moment i just want to find a hole and bury myself.With that i'm just really lonely, when i felt really crappy i knew i could alway go and party with Paul or talk to him but now that isn't possible.  i just can't anymore, it's stupid i know and i'm glad he is happy.  Even when he does speak to me, he's always with her.  i'm not really jealous of her either.  He promised to find the time to party with me, i know that isn't going to happen and wisp died again and i just don't have the drive to build her back up.i'm just really depressed and just everything seems to be a big deal, and i really don't want to keep company with myself so why should anyone.Anyway i'm off to wallow in my own selfpity again, and i'll talk to you later.*Hugs you tightly* Thanks for thinking of meWisp"
