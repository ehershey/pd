__Letter "Well, it wouldn't let me e-mail you at either of your addresses so here:Jake,Hey, what's up man?  You should be done soon, shouldn't you?  Or is that July?  Anyway, PD is pretty boring.  Not that I've had any time with it anyway, with exams and all.  Stormbringer put me in charge of drawing the pics of the races and class/subclasses.  It's hard because I keep producing shit. -_-  I'm gonna try to do a new Furion, too, since the original I drew was lame.I've also found out how to have two AIM accounts running at the same time, so I can have one for my vampire character and there will be no supicion that we're the same person.  Well, I'm interested to hear what's up with you.  Write back.Lev"
