__Letter "02/01/03so sorry about yesterday.. i was sick and couldnt situp for long.. I'm back.. feeling ok while the meds arekicking.. but ya know how it goes...I read today a list of a slaves basic needs ascompared to wants.  I'm now wondering if there issomeone out there capable of handling so muchpressure.  Is there anyone in this world that canhandle just accepting me as me.. the good.. the bad..and that almost hideous me in the morning.. x.x?   Imean.. can you imagine someone you can trust so fullythat even those hidden.. inner most feelings can beshared to them.  You know.. the ones even you getsquemish thinking about.  I can't imagine there everbeing someone that forgiving or kind to take on allthe responsibilities that come with me and letting mejust be theres.  Even loving me enough to guide me tonew growth.  My biggest fear is that if I foundsomeone that loving and kind.. that gentle.. i'd dosomething that would turn them away from me.. how do Ikeep that from happening? and how do i stop feelingthat way if i do ever find someone?  I mean damn.. i'mscared enoguh i'm going to turn you guys away fromme.. much less someone I love with all my heart (nooffence meant by that.. but you know what i mean.. ihope)  there are so many questions im asking myself..and if I ever did find this person.. i dont think idbe able to even look at them until i was able toanswer all of these questions myself.  Irs kindalike.. I don't want them to see any bad in me.  Iguess.. purify myself before they have to meet me..that way i wont give them any reason to bedissapointed in me or get angry with me.  How could Ilive with myself if i FINALLY find that one specialperson.. and screw it up?I need to be perfect for them.. and hopefully in 2years I can at least be on my way to that goalYours,Heather"
