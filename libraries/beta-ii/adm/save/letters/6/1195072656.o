__Letter "It seems that while I could've been talking to you, I was insteadsleeping. :( Sleep is currently ticking me off. I have the classestoday so it may be difficult to see much of you. I think I will try to stay up tomorrow until I get the chance to see you, asidefrom a couch nap early. Those are remarkably unsatisfying andgenerally pretty brief. i miss you like the deserts miss the rain,like a bad sniper misses his targets, like Big Bird misses thelimelight. Darn that Elmo! Anyway, please take care and know thatI miss you verrrrrrrrry much.Love,Axenos"
