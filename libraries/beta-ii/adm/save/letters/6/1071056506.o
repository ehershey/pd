__Letter "Well, I know you're a good coder, and have had some good ideas for abilities and areas.  I know you'd do a great job of helping to flesh out the MUD.  We're having issues with abilities and balance, so I'll tell you straight ahead that if you make an ability it may be a while before it's reviewed/added.  My other request is to not have aziraphale on while you're coding.  That's all I ask.  Thanks.                        -Nightshade"
