__Letter "i have a suggestion for a room to code for players to talk to each other or multiple people without the fear of typing on the wrong line, accidently replying to someone else who sends them a tell or saying the wrong thing in front of other people.i was thinking of a room where only a player who has asked for one can enter but can invite other people in so they can talk using the say command. I am putting this suggestion in because i have notices myself replying to the wrong person when talking to some people and sometimes i didnt want the person or other people to hear what i was saying as it may have been personal or something of the like. If a room could be coded ( i can do it myself and submit it to you is you wish ) for players to talk privatly among themselves then it would save a lot of embaressment with some players or those who get the wrong message from someone else. It would also protect those who are of a sensitive age and should not be hearing some of the things that are said between people.Please mail me back with suggestions or ideas.Please mail me back with suggestions or ideas.CheersCrem"
