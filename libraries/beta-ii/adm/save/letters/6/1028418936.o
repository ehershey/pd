__Letter "first off, u know how there are different rages. say a melee one and a weapon one.. i think i should have demon abilities in the Melee ones, purly because otherwise me being a demon is useless, i've gone to 50, back to 30, i dun want slash, i just wanna be equal with the other advantaged races eg. Raknid 4 hit slash (not penelized), centaur/weimic for charging skill, making rush in melee rage half decent. I can understand that u might think this is too powerful, but really i don't have any magic defense, i have less skills then a warrior, i don't have any spells unlike the anti paladin, so right now i am easy pickings, as for balancing issues, balancing will never work, there will always be a para combined with a very powerful spell... or rage with 4 arms, the slash is insane, but i want to be original, i never wanted my abilities included into the weapon abilities rage, just melee... OK, perhaps massacre should be a VERY (like 1 every 50 rounds in rage), but as for gore, it isn't as good as slashbut it is better then rush, and i need something better then my rush, if i had the charging skill rush would be livable, but it still wouldn't make sense why a big nasty demon would hold back from his best abilities while he is a fit of Rage... really all i wanna be is the equal to the raknid and centaur zerker, and this would make it... well maybe wouldn't make the raknid, but i'd be closer, and no i don't want to make a raknid zerker, because i spend 1 weeks playing time trying to make a pretty good and original concept. I can understand your frustration of having to add new abilities to rage, but as i said why would a demon hold those abilities back.most people i know, agree that it should be in, It just makes sense to everyone, and balancing... Gore is pathetic right now, i get more melee then any other class and it still isn't as good as slash.. so i dun see the prob with adding it to my rage, i mean there are advantages to going kataan, antis have spells and MD, angels can be hackless just by going cleric and getting to 50.SORRY for writing a bookAldur."
