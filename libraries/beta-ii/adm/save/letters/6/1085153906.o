__Letter "first off, I keep mudlife seperate from real life as well. My relationships with players outside the mud do not affect my choices as an immortal. Even if my best friend IRL got on here - if they swore over newbie, they'd be gagged. Secondly, as for Pyro - i dont care about the shield or whatever was written in its code. The point is that you allowed a known troublemaker and banned builder to code.As for you not liking drama and conflict, you seem to enjoy creating it around you. Dont play the \"i want to be friends\" card with me. Its not going to work. Even if you're completely sincere. Your attempts to vilify the immortal staff on the mud have really damaged it. Regardless of what you thought you were doing. One thing that I dont stand for is uncalled for cruelty. Many things you said or typed - even if they were just your opinions - were cruel. You could have put them in words that did not cut to the quick, and yet you chose to. You can see every single word you type, and consider sending before you send.As for how you feel about me as an immortal - it doesn't matter. I do my job. and yes, you are going to have to deal with that. You know that. Know that I'm not going to be watching you closer than usual or anything because of this mess. You bend rules. You manipulate words. You pit people against eachother. IMO  - strictly as an immortal on PD, you should lose your character. I am CCing a copy of your mail and mine to Nightshade and Stormbringer, as I have every mudmail I have received from you in the past.I am quite aware of the insinuations included in your mail and your public apology. They are not appreciated.~Azire"
