__Letter "I know I told you I would drop the whole Helena matter. I'm sorry to go back on my word. Aziraphale made a post on the Tirun board, that pretty much lets me know that Helena has shared private information that she could only get as an immortal about me, to at least one other player (Aziraphale). If you really want me to remove the post, I will. I don't want to cause you any stress. I hope you understand that. You have no idea how much respect I have for you, and this is not to hurt you or undermine you in any way.I did drop the matter. I deleted the post, you didn't ask me to, but I did. I thought about it, and I realized, there was no point in me posting that. You were right. It would only lead to arguments, and more drama. It wouldn't benefit the mud in any way. You suggested that I read what other people had to say. I did. I saw that most people supported me. And a couple argued. When I read Aziraphale's post..and with his current title something along the lines of \"no place like 127.0.0.1\", which is obviously directed at me....well. Helena broke a rule. I *HOPE* that some action will be sought here. I am not \"forcing\" you, or threatening or...anything along those lines. Please do not take what I'm saying in that way. I'm trying very hard to write this mail to you in a way that you won't take... in the way you've been taking everything I give you...I'm sorry for the stress I cause you, I really am. I know that you have a real life, with real problems, just as the rest of us do. My goal in life isn't to make things harder on you. Believe it or not, my goal in life is to make things easier on people, including you, and to just help everyone that I can. I do not have a personal vendetta against you, and especially not against Helena. You have no idea of all the help I've given her in the past. I taught her how to do so many things on PD. And I even helped her a lot with her personal life struggles. I just hope that something is done about this. If not, that's okay too. You're the admin, I'm the player, I do completely recognize this, and I'm not trying to gain power or authority over anything. Upon your request, I will immediately remove the post.Take Care,Jen"
