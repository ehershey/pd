__Letter "Hi, I removed Tinochu, but no need to explain this name I guess.I've been going through a lot of mixed emotions, no point in saying anymore about it.I would put my own name on here, but I doubt I'll do much on hereany more. If you ever want to see what I've written - i'm on myspace aswyldflwr09.  It's just a journal, nothing more.I might be on capping as wyldflwr in the future.  Thank youfor the time you gave me and I'm glad you and Josh madeup. Take care of yourself, bye,Rayna."
