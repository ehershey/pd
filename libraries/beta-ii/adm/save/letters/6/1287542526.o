__Letter "Residents: Mathiu, Orcha, Bragi, Yang, PiehlRooms: 7Layout: Entrance, exit leading down into main lobby, which leads into 4 bedrooms to the north, east, south, and west. Last room leads down into the 5th bedroom.Locked doors: 1 lock on each bedroom = 5 locks.Room descriptions with color and senses:Main room:You step into a large room. The room doesn't seem to lead anywhere, much less be accomadating. As you walk further into the room, a click sounds, and the floor opens up into a very large tunnel leading downward.Listen: Dead silenceSmell: The smell of the town outside permeates the inside of the house.Lobby:After walking down for what seems like hours, you end in a huge room. The most noticable feature in the room is the massive staircase leading down. On each side of the room is a door leading to one of the house's Masters. The massive chandelier in the center of the towering ceiling is adorned with massive jewels even a dragon would be proud to have. Across the room is a bar with every kind of drink imagineable.Listen: Muffled sounds come from every direction.Smell: The smell of alchohol from the bar fills the air.Mathiu:%^CYAN%^As you enter a very large room, two enormous eyes, each with a %^BLACK%^BOLD%^ra%^RED%^g%^BLUE%^in%^BLACK%^g %^BLUE%^blue %^WHITE%^storm%^RESET%^CYAN%^ inside of them peer down at you, watching your every move from the ceiling. The room becomes to feel unbearably heavy. The wall to your side is lined with an assortment of staves, each looking more %^RED%^BOLD%^d%^BLACK%^e%^RED%^a%^BLACK%^d%^RED%^l%^BLACK%^y%^RESET%^CYAN%^ and %^BOLD%^RED%^d%^BLUE%^e%^RED%^s%^BLUE%^t%^RED%^r%^BLUE%^u%^RED%^c%^BLUE%^t%^RED%^i%^BLUE%^v%^RED%^e%^RESET%^CYAN%^ than the one next to it. On the other side, a rather large bookshelf houses what seems like hundreds of %^WHITE%^BOLD%^spellbooks%^RESET%^CYAN%^ and %^BLACK%^BOLD%^tomes%^RESET%^CYAN%^. A huge round table sits in the very center of the room, covered in many different colored %^GREEN%^BOLD%^p%^WHITE%^o%^GREEN%^t%^WHITE%^i%^GREEN%^o%^WHITE%^n%^GREEN%^s%^RESET%^CYAN%^, a few broken staves, and quite a few %^RED%^b%^BOLD%^u%^ORANGE%^r%^RESET%^RED%^n%^CYAN%^ marks. A large bed fills one corner of the room, covered in open books and orbs. There is a fireplace taking up an opposite corner of the room, %^RED%^a%^BOLD%^b%^ORANGE%^l%^YELLOW%^a%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^z%^RED%^e%^CYAN%^ with a magnificient %^BLUE%^BOLD%^b%^RESET%^BLUE%^l%^BOLD%^u%^RESET%^BLUE%^e%^CYAN%^ fire.Listen: The sound of a roaring fire fills the room.Smell: The smell of potions and burnt wood emanates from the room.Yang:%^GREEN%^You step in through a large doorway. Hundreds of %^RESET%^w%^BOLD%^ea%^RESET%^p%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^n%^BOLD%^s%^RESET%^GREEN%^ line every wall. %^RESET%^S%^BOLD%^w%^RESET%^o%^BOLD%^r%^RESET%^d%^BOLD%^s%^RESET%^GREEN%^, %^RED%^BOLD%^h%^RESET%^RED%^a%^BOLD%^m%^RESET%^RED%^m%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^RED%^r%^BOLD%^s%^RESET%^GREEN%^, and weapons few people have ever seen. The sheer magnitude of weapons here could equip an entire army. There doesn't seem to be any kind of bed, other than a %^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^BLUE%^m%^BLUE%^BOLD%^p%^RESET%^BLUE%^l%^BLUE%^BOLD%^ex%^RESET%^GREEN%^ array of what seems like %^WHITE%^BOLD%^sharp %^RESET%^steel%^GREEN%^ webs on the ceiling. The webs spread throughout the entire room, arching from one side to another. If you didn't know your way around, one could be %^WHITE%^BOLD%^c%^RESET%^u%^BOLD%^t%^RESET%^GREEN%^ into pieces trying to navigate around the webs. The enormous fireplace in the corner of the room lights up the entire room easily, reflecting a %^RED%^deep red %^GREEN%^light off of the myriad of weapons and webs, making the room seem rather menacing. Listen: You hear the sound of weapons scraping against one another.Smell: The smell of metal is strong.Bragi:%^MAGENTA%^A faint sound of %^BOLD%^m%^YELLOW%^u%^RED%^s%^BLUE%^i%^MAGENTA%^c%^RESET%^MAGENTA%^ enters your ears as you walk into the room. It's difficult to tell where it's coming from, as there are many instruments laying around the room. Most of them custom made, and never before seen. Across from the instruments, an impressive array of %^RESET%^b%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^a%^BOLD%^d%^RESET%^e%^BOLD%^s%^RESET%^MAGENTA%^ are displayed, all looking whimsical, while at the same time %^RED%^d%^BOLD%^e%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^d%^%^RED%^l%^BOLD%^y%^RESET%^MAGENTA%^. The music gets louder the further into the room you go, until it seems to take over your body, strengthening you. The %^WHITE%^a%^YELLOW%^m%^ORANGE%^b%^CYAN%^i%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^n%^WHITE%^ce%^MAGENTA%^ of the music is only disrupted slightly by the crackle of %^RED%^f%^ORANGE%^i%^YELLOW%^r%^RESET%^RED%^e%^MAGENTA%^ in the furthest corner, where a fireplace houses a %^CYAN%^BOLD%^b%^WHITE%^l%^YELLOW%^i%^CYAN%^n%^WHITE%^d%^CYAN%^i%^YELLOW%^n%^CYAN%^g %^WHITE%^white %^RESET%^MAGENTA%^fire.Listen: Powerful music fills your ears.Smell: The smell of wood polish emenates from all the instrumentsOrcha:%^ORANGE%^As you go further down into the house, it becomes extremely %^RED%^h%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^RED%^t%^ORANGE%^, and the air starts to feel very %^WHITE%^BOLD%^c%^RESET%^ha%^WHITE%^r%^CYAN%^BOLD%^g%^WHITE%^ed%^RESET%^ORANGE%^, causing your hair to stand on end. Looking around, this massive area seems to be more like a cave than a room. An endless %^BLACK%^BOLD%^pit%^RESET%^ORANGE%^ of %^RED%^m%^ORANGE%^o%^YELLOW%^l%^RESET%^ORANGE%^t%^RED%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^RED%^n %^ORANGE%^l%^YELLOW%^a%^%^RESET%^ORANGE%^v%^RED%^a%^ORANGE%^ is all that greets you across this massive expanse of %^RED%^b%^BLACK%^BOLD%^u%^RESET%^RED%^r%^BOLD%^BLACK%^n%^RESET%^RED%^t %^BOLD%^BLACK%^rock%^RESET%^ORANGE%^. An enormous pile of %^YELLOW%^j%^BOLD%^WHITE%^e%^CYAN%^w%^YELLOW%^e%^WHITE%^l%^MAGENTA%^s%^RESET%^ORANGE%^ and %^YELLOW%^gold%^RESET%^ORANGE%^ to the left is the only thing that could be considered a bed. To the side of the cave are piles of %^RESET%^bones%^ORANGE%^ you can only assume are the remains of unwelcome %^GREEN%^elves%^ORANGE%^ and %^RED%^BOLD%^ogres%^RESET%^ORANGE%^. The %^RED%^m%^ORANGE%^a%^BOLD%^RED%^g%^YELLOW%^m%^RESET%^RED%^a%^ORANGE%^ seems to be magically funneled into four different sections through the roof to the other rooms of the house.Listen: The sound of bubbling molten lava echoes throughout the cavern.Smell: The smell of decay mixed with sulphur and brimstone assaults your senses.Piehl:%^BLACK%^BOLD%^The light becomes very %^RESET%^d%^BLACK%^BOLD%^i%^RESET%^m%^BLACK%^BOLD%^ as you enter this room. As you step further in, a few shadows seem to dart to separate sides of the room. Squinting your eyes, you can make out a wide array of daggers, most of them covered in %^RED%^b%^RESET%^RED%^l%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^RED%^o%^BOLD%^d%^RESET%^BLACK%^BOLD%^, on the closest side of the room. There seems to be the crackle of %^RED%^f%^RESET%^ORANGE%^i%^RED%^BOLD%^r%^%^RESET%^RED%^e%^BLACK%^BOLD%^ on the far side of the room, but nothing can be easily seen. If you strain your eyes enough, you can make out what seems to be dancing black fire in the fireplace, almost as if it's sucking the light out of the room.Listen: A faint crackle of fire interrupts the otherwise dead silence.Smell: The smell of blood permeates the air."
