__Letter "What would you say is the max AC for each of the armour types, as guild eq.For balance purposes, the eq autoloads just if you are in illuminati, can we get higher ac if I set a minimum level to the autoload as well?How high would it be for each type? A few points below the max as set out in 'help balarm'?Just interested so I can make a heap of eq to spend hte guild treasury on.ok done."
