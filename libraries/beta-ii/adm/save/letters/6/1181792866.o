__Letter "It looks ok to me. The Pelicans need to be a max of level 25, evenif they aren't meant to be attacked.Also, Pelican Paul's is_invincible needs to make sure it can't killanyone. As is, it is possible a newbie could die from it. His strengthneeds to be a more normal number, too - 1000 is just ridiculous.After those few changes I think the area will be ok to go in, afteranother imm reviews it too of course. I've already posted asking forsomeone else to go over it."
