There seems to be dew around the base of the trees.petals- So soft, so pure, it floats towards the ground like a snow flake.snow flake- pure white flower petals that falls out of the tree like a drifting snow flake.hill- The view of the hill is particilly obscure by the tree branches.branches- Are heavy laden with white flower petals.dew- beautiful crystal in a tear-drop shape, placed around the  base of the tree.base- Funny looking dew drops are around the tree."
