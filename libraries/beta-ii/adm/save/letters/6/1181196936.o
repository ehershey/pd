__Letter "Hehe, see I am trying to learn your language.  I was saying \"Hi!\" to you,I hope you understood that.  It's hard learning bird language, along withthe other Mud languages.I miss our discussions and hope we can talk on a more \"bird-like\"level soon.  Hugs and wark well (Be well).Lady Adilaxo"
