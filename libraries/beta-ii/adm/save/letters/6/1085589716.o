__Letter "Ok, this is my idea for a cleric level 50 spell/ability since they don't have any at all. I personally don't think it'll affect balance all that much but that is up to you (imm/admins) to decide.Ok, the basic idea is an aura type thing. I'm not sure if this can be coded but if it can, i think that it'll really help the struggling cleric class without overpowering them because i don't want clerics to become hackless. My reasoning for not wanting clerics to become hackless is simple, i don't want the MUD to become overrun with clerics, as i feel that this would make the game boring. Anyway, back to the idea description :POkay,the first item that i'll cover is what the aura does. It Randomly Heals the cleric and/or deals damage to creatures/players that are in combat with the cleric, this could be seen as the diety watching over its devout cleric. Also while the aura is active, it should be possible for the cleric to cast spells of it's own. I was thinking that the chance for each the healing special or the dmg special should be no more the 20-25% per combat round or heartbeat (which ever is deemed appropriate), but make it possible for both to happen at the same time. Now how much should the healing and the damage be? well i've put quite a bit of thought into this and have come up with what i personally think would be balanced, although it may not be, im not sure. What i have come up with is this, the healing should do ~1/3 of maximum cure for thier level, so at level 50 it would be ~167. For the damage aspect i was thinking of working it as ((Faith + Belief + wisdom)/4) this would work out to be ~174 damage for me ((300 + 300 + 95)/4), the reason i don't think magic attack should be used it because the damage is divine, and not from the actual caster. If there are any questions in this area, please, do not hesitate to ask.Now casting time, how much mp, etc. Casting time and duration should be dependant on faith, so for example a level 50 player with 300 faith would have a aura duration of 300 heartbeats (10 miniutes) however, it should have a casting time of faith divided by 5 seconds (or faith divided by 10 heartbeats) (so for level 50 with 300 faith it would take 60 seconds to cast and goes up by 1.2 seconds per level) now this is a long casting time and by level 100 (if any cleric ever got that high :P) it would take 2 minutes to cast, but last for 20 minutes. now in this time i think it would be really neat if there were little messages that the player got as they cast the spell (of them praying or somthing). Also casting should paralize the player, and cost all the casters mp, and their mp should stay at 0 mp for the duration of the casting as the cleric is devoting all of their energy to praying to their god. An upkeep for the Aura may not be a bad idea, somthing like 100 mp every 10 heartbeats or somthing.  -- Templar Tsuke."
