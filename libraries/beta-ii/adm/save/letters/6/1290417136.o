__Letter "Hey dude, I've noticed that the guild list has gotten quite large, and there are quite a few inactive people. I figured we can clean it up a bit. Figured I would send a mail to every abandoned (our alts excluded) and tell them we are deleting every inactive player.It also seems like Forsaken is becoming the go-to guild when you just want to be in a guild, so I think adding a small requirement would be a good thing. Nothing major, just something like you have to have been active for atleast 2 weeks to be eligible to join. That will weed out the people who log on once every 2 months and keep our list full of active people. Also, you can only be in Forsaken if you don't have alts in another guild. I feel this is important just incase some drama breaks out and other guilds have people that can come and spy on our guild line.Email back what you think."
