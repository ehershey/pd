__Letter "i was wondering if you could post on the sub-class boards when you remove something like i didn't know create was gone kinda sucked because i didn't have any bags and i went to feed on corpse and that's when i found out that was gone as well. i'm coming to you about this because you are the one that is fixing and puting things ininsted of listening to everyone bs that might not have the right infosome have told me necros won't be getting the bags back some sai they will just will be called something else.most mages use the create spell for only bags, i would have to say i might be the only mage that doesn't i use the bread as well i don't only use magic in combat i use my physical abilities as well especially when my mp is way downnd feed some said you found it worthless is why you took it out i used that as welli was just shocked to see those gonei'm not mad at all i mean really where would that even get me if i was but i just wanted to hear it first hand insted of second hand bsthanksFury"
