__Letter "I really need you to stop by on BUilders at some point. I havemade alot of adjustments and additions to the builders site.Several commands have been installed as well. I want to reviewa few of these changes when you got a few minutes to do so.I will be on tomorrow morning, most afternoons from 6 to 8:30 est,and all day on sundays. Please come to builders for a bit so i cangive you a walk thru of what i have added. It's quite extensive.Ironman"
