__Letter "Ethereal is a group of people that contain both the darkness and the light in their hearts, for without one there would not be the other. The guild serves neither good or evil, but remains between both to keep balance to itself and to the world it resides in. Ethereal members live by one saying:I'd like the motto to be kept there but this paragraph replacing the old one."
