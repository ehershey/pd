__Letter "When your not mad at me anymore i was wondering if i could code an area with the glacier property to dock at the north or south pole. I would greatly appreciate being able to make one of these, and i will follow by any structure you say, town, frozen tundra, ice village, ice forest, and any type of animal you want in there (if they arent real just say you want that and i will set their race for that, and a body type for something that matches). So.. anyway... ermm... hehe, thats all. (i couldnt make my other quest village that was gonna take a year because i couldnt figure ouit how to query a single quest and even to just add and remove quests). Ermm.. thats all :P. contact me when your not angry anymore, uhh.... yeah.                                                                        %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^~%^RESET%^%^RED%^P%^BOLD%^y%^RESET%^%^RED%^r%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^"
