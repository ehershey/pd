__Letter "strip_colors() should do only what it says, strip colors...erroneous characters should just be fixed, I don't even know what a ^Rwould display as, but it certainly wouldn't be the same everywhere like it should be.I don't see a need to edit the mapper to try and take that into consideration,we should just fix/replace nonstandard ascii chars with standard ascii."
