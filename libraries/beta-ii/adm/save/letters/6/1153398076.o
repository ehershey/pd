__Letter "Sorry that they're messin with your class and all.  One thing that you do have going for you though is, you're one of the few necros that are high level and still runs around to play.  This means that you'll get a much larger say as to what goes on with them in the meantime.  So if you just try to work with Nulvect on it, you'll probably be able to get him to give you something at least as good as chaoswave, if not better."
