__Letter "I read the rules and am requesting permission for the wife and I to play at the same time. We understand that we aren't to exchangeitems or money and no pk, which we aren't into the pk thing anyway.We follow the rules, don't abuse bugs, report things that don't seemright. We met on a mud years ago, then got married, so its morenostalgia than anything, hah. So, if you have any questions, happy to answer anything.Dante"
