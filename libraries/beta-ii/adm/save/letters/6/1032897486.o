__Letter "KK did a little holyfire testing.Seems to always work at hitting everything i'm in combat with now. Which makes it MUCH more powerful than it was before (i made in excess of 30 mil per hour before).Damage is still very high. 900 vs yakko in arena. I insta-kill 27k mobs with 1 holyfire. With the non-missing i'd estimate i could make 40 mil an hour now. Which is insane.... a good sized fighter will make around 12-15. A rogue 20. A mage can make a lot... but they dont have cure which slows them down a bit.I'd say make a large damage cut to holyfire as it hits more targets. As in it does 900 total but if i holyfire 4 mobs its divided over all of them. Right now this new holyfire is very close in power to the old one (i lost 1/10 damage is all it seems in testing). 3 hits kills 40k mobs now which would make forbidden forest insane.Anyways to sum up its damage is still way strong, but i like how its redone so it doesnt miss.-- Ash"
