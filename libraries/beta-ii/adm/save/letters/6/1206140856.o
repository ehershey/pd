__Letter "It's ok, love. I was still kinda sleepy but didnt wanna recognizeit. It recognized me, tho! Put me down for the count!! But now, Iam up for the duration. :) So, maybe we'll meet again before workwhich would be awesome. :) But, I am flexible so no worries. It'sEaster Break so it shouldnt be so busy I can't get away from workat the scheduled time (1030p your time). I am glad you were able to talk to friends and be helpful to thefabulous Trevor. :D To ensure I dont fall back asleep, I am goingdownstairs on the computer there. Had a Naruto dream after the gum got stuck to my fingers. Also had a video game/pinball dream.Weird stuff but felt right normal for me. :) See you later, love!More love,James"
