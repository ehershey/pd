__Letter "Nope...  Can't really do anything about that.  All I can reccommend is that you have someone sit near the tirun shops and let yourself get caught.  Then have them buy all your stuff back.  That's one of the downfalls from using kill all.  If that's your first outlaw offence, you wont die, so dont worry.  Just make sure someone's there to grab your stuff.Paul"
