__Letter "Here are some ideas that I thought up for vampires.  I don't expect you to use any of them, but they're there if you like any number of them.- Getting a large amount of HP per level/con.  Maybe 40-50.  And naturally healing something like 10-20% of that HP each round.  The idea is that they're like cockroaches - incredibly difficult to kill.  The current help file says that they're 'immortal', so lets make them survivors during the night, even if that means nerfing their attack power.  This of course only works during the night.  Also, being undead, they can't heal using ANY items or magic.  Only what their bodies regenerate themselves.  In fact, you could have healing spells damage them.  - Blood points - Vampires have to drink blood, because without BP they can't do anything.  You could have their HP/SP/MP regenerate at some rate, but only as long as they have blood to work with.- During the day, their healing rate freezes.  Their mystical regeneration is the only thing preventing them from dying in the light, but it is completely occupied by staving off that destruction, so they're sitting ducks.  They also are probably easily blinded by light.  They would be okay indoors.- Weak v.s. turn, since they're undead.- No actual death - their bodies are removed from the battlefield and returned somewhere.  They experience the same stat/exp/etc. loss as anyone else, but they never drop a corpse (since they're immortal).  They can of course be stolen from.- If this is possible, I think they should be permanent outlaws.  A known vampire shouldn't be allowed to wander around in a protected town.  Make them outcasts!- Some kind of blood drinking technique that is like a slow moving charge/backstab.  It drains HP in much lower amounts, round by round - the duration depending on some kind of skill, and charisma.  It would transfer HP into BP, though.- Maybe 'trance' which amplifies the vampire's charisma with respect to a particular target, so if they try to blood drink they are more successful.- Phasmaform: An ability allowing the vampire to turn into a ghost without death penalties.  They possibly lose their inventory or something, but can rematerialize later.  Probably takes a lot of BP.- Deathaura: The aura of the vampire explodes and a whole bunch of creepy, black, hyperphysical steam and confusion blasts out of their body in all directions, delivering damage = # of kills, or divide that by however much depending on how many mobs are in the game.  (So that a vampire with all the kills isn't overpowered).  -  Liches could probably have Deathaura too, unless you want to keep them distinct from one another.- miasmabreath - The vampire's body accumulates poisons and diseases and such that it does not need to combat because it is already dead.  These are stored, dormant, somewhere in its torso.  It can breath them out into the room, affecting everyone.  I'm not sure what this one could be based on.  Maybe, like the help file says, this one could be based on age.  It makes sense that the vampire has been exposed to more contageon as time goes by.  A no damage attack, it just unleashes a lot of poison.- Maybe give them shadowburst during the night.- If you give them anything like cloak, maybe make them able to SEE other cloaked people during the night.  If they're photosensitive enough to be killed by sunlight, then they ought to see everything in the dark.- Melee for fighting skill? - maybe a night-time technique that just gives them a lot of normal round attacks.  I haven't really thought of how they could fight (most of the abilities listed seem kind of like 'supers' and not practical for EXPing) but maybe they could manipulate the darkness a lot.  Lots of attacks where they make the darkness so dense that it becomes physical and can do stuff.  Here are a few:- umbrasmash - A pumped up shadowburst- blackaegis - The darkness solidifies around the vampire, raising defense temporarily. (I like this one because it increases the survival factor)- reaper - the scythe of the grim reaper materializes in the vampire's hand long enough for them to deliver an attack with it.  Maybe a low-level vampire can materialize the scythe for a moment, but can't maintain it long enough to attack, and falls to the floor.  =P  I guess if they were super-advanced in whatever skill this took, they could continue delivering attacks before the scythe disappeared.  If you take anything away from this list, I hope it's this: legendarily difficult to \"kill\" during the night or indoors, sitting ducks during the outdoor day.LeviP.S.: Most of these things don't need to be in game until we open the quest.  =)"
