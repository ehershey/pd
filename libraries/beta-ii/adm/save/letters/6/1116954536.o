__Letter "I think its cool that you want to come out but I think June is too soon for me. I will have only just moved and I need to be alone for a bit for reasons that I can't explain in a simple mud mail. Give me some time please and than we can meet.  Once I'm in my apartment, I can call and try to explain my crazy situation here.Illisse the Enchantress"
