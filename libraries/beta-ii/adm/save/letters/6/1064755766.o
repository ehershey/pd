__Letter "yo stormy, I just wanted to know if I could get my builders access back, and I hear that you need to make a small area before you can continue coding what you want, so if you wanna assign me a topic or whatever that would be coolanyways, I have been coding my area but thanks to the downtime ect, I havent been able to upload or test it, or even rember how to do things properly, so most of it prolly wont work :PSo when you get this, if I am on or whatever please get in contact with me to help me set this up, Az and Wolfspirit have both said they will help me with stuff, and I do understand basic programming logic, and have done a little C work, so It shouldnt be too long before I am pumping out areas for this place.Ug."
