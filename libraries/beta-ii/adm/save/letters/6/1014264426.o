__Letter "STORYLINE PROPOSAL		After the war that wiped out most of the gods, Seekercame to this world and brought some order to the incredibleCarnage left behind.  He brought with him two deities, Infernoand Stormbringer, to bring balance.  Unfortunately, their mereholy presence awakened a great evil known as Asmodeus.  He created hell and tempted mortals to stray from the virtuouspath, promising them incredible power and eternal life.	After many hundreds of years, Asmodeus' army grew very large.  His elite evil races, the demons and gremlins,were many.  Before these forces were too powerful to contain,Inferno created the arch angels in hopes of forever bannishingthe demons and Asmodeus.  Despite incredible efforts, neitherside was willing to take the help of weaklings or those whodid not fully appreciate the meaning of their side, so a greatbalance grew which has lasted for as long as anyone can truelyremember.  The balance which even the demons and angels have come to understand and accept, which they continuously strivedto break but secretly knew would never end.  	Until Myrir, one of the more powerful surviving gods.Some say that Myrir was stronger than Seeker.  Others say theywere equals.  They deffinately had a bond of some kind but onlythey truely know.  Myrir was the first to perfect the use ofthe unmade, the amplified life force left behind when a beingis unmade by the gods.  The tremendous power of the unmade wasthought to be nothing more than mounds and mounds of garbage,the idea that it could be harnessed was ridiculous.  But Myrircreated unsentient minions of incredible power.  The balancewas broken.  	A great war errupted again, between Myrir and the gods.Seeker, Stormbringer and Inferno combined could not best Myrirwith the unmade at his side.  Many mortal warriors perrishedin this war and in the end, his first unmade warrior defeated,the desperate Myrir cast a great spell that unmade Sindarii and anyone who was born there.	Asmodeus, enraged at his loss of demons, took hold ofhis legendary axe and attacked Myrir himself.  It was a greatbattle but in the end, Myrir slew Asmodeus.  Evil was decimatedand once again, balance was along with it.  Myrir's energyexhausted, he fled and began a deep sleep until he would onceagain be strong enough to try again.	With the center of the world Sindarii, completelydestroyed, the world started to drift apart and a few new towns were established without any knowledge of each other.The gods had lost much hope but Stormbringer reconstructed thecenter of the world, the city of Tirun.  Compared to Sindarii,it's size and beauty had increased tenfold.  An organized system of law slowly emerged and people began forming guilds,establishing Tirun as the greatest city once again, in factthe only town large enough to be considered a city.	Seeker, comporable to a king of the gods, was extremely impressed.  He acknowledged Stormbringer as an equal and shared the realm with him.  The two also created a few immortals to aid in the reconstruction of the world.  Inferno, however,  slowly grew away from the people.  Hisangels also decimated, mortals could only spread rumours thathe might return one day to see their rebirth.  	A mortal by the name of Leviathas, a low priest atthe temple of Asmodeus, was enraged at the turn of events.  He wanted nothing more than for Asmodeus to be ressurrected,though it was assumed impossible to ressurrect a god, and tosee the demons thrive once again.  He created the unholy guildfor this purpose, co leading with a kataan whom he believedto be the reincarnation of the great demon princess of the old world, Wildflower.	The world was growing again with new heroes and villains, oblivious to the recouperating Myrir.  The futureis uncertain.STORYLINE PROPOSAL		After the war that wiped out most of the gods, Seekercame to this world and brought some order to the incredibleCarnage left behind.
