__Letter "Hey bubba, im going to need arch or admin access to the armour.c file (or you can e-mail it to me) so I can code some new armour for the guild.My idea was that the armour would query the player, then set itself to the players current limbs, but  I need to look at the armour.c file to see if it has a wear_function in it"
