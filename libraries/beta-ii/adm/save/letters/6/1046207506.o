__Letter "Sounds good. Reducing all raknid abilities to 2 hits (very rarely more) would really help. The sheer number of raknids on the mud show the power of this class. Perhaps limiting it to 2 hits would even be balanced as they do get 2 extra normal attacks.Your balance sounds great :) ThxOh ya... also the stat thing you talked about in the past (low str/con and high dex) would really hlep to balance raknids. Currently their con is as good as an angel's."
