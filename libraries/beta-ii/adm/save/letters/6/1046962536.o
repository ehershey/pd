__Letter "yeah i agree about prator i have been dealing with heavy sp costs ever since i started playing a dragon which was end of last year when sp cost more and that's not the main reason but im not gonna sit there and make a huge paragraph etc it is a fair bit annoying when someone half my level like wraith makes 20 mill an hour and i make 11 i aint being an ass at stinking all as for complaigning all i get from almost every single player on the mud is i am freaking hackless etc and no matter how many times i tell them what costs i have etc what level i am they just keep saying to me i am bs which is why i get this sence that people are complaigning about me and as to why i am so annoyed as for the reason why i aint playing anymore from the damage no cost is hardly an issue see i been playing with the costs this whole time fair i get it and then i liked it being too good i knew i wasn't going to have it forever it's mainly players saying i am full of bloody shit and telling me i am hackless even though i tell them the costs of my abilities that's the main reason so that's why i think they say to you i am too good etc while i wait their sitting for my abilities to be further reduced or whatever because of the players harassing you to put me in my place i don't know if they have been saying anything to you but from the crap they give me it just feels like it it's also annoying to hear half my level players just do so much but as i said it's not gonna matter anymore anyway and no i don't know it because of the damage of my moves it's hardly that so fair enough i was just told i will be ridded because i gave you a mouthful cause i was pissed offAnyway as you have sorta said in your mail that no one has said anything to you about me i have clearly pissed you off so i aint gonna bother playing when i have a admin wanting to dest me for breathing wrong"
