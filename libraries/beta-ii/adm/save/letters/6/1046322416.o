__Letter "I don't think there is much of a worry of me posting on the boards, as this is my first time logging on in like 6 weeks :(  Also, I don't think i have a current post on the Scorpio board.  That and even when you promoted me, I told you I'd defer to you on any decisions.  Of course, now that you've sent the mail, now i'm just curious as to your reasons even if i can probably guess at least part of them. :p"
