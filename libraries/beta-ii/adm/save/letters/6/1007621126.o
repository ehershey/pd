__Letter ";I dont know what to say, love, I wish I could be there to hold you, I wish I could make it all better for you. I've been where you are, I know it's easy as shit to just give up and let go.. Doesn't it always seem like the fakes are happiest? >.< You just need to find something that makes you happy, I guess.. You're not alone in this, life isn't black for you alone, love. They're hard to find, but I swear to you some people are different. Some care..The dentist wasn't that bad, though, was it? Sorry I didn't mail you back any sooner, the post office system wasn't letting me read my mail for a while there, though I dont know why it is now...-shrug-Take your love, take your pain and fuck the world for what it's worth. Make yourself happy, Jen, I have yet to find somebody that would seek out another soul and bring them from the darkness into joy. You can't wait for that person to come along, what if (s)he doesn't exist?Find your own happiness, I dont know.. I guess I personally just adapt to whatever situation I'm put in.. Depression and whatever else may come, it just becomes routine and I pull myself through another dayThe last week would have damn near been hell for me if it wasn't for thatI dont know what I'm trying to say, but whatever you get out of this, if anything, I hope it means something, since I guess that's all that really mattersI'll talk to ya tomorrow :)Love,       Andy"
