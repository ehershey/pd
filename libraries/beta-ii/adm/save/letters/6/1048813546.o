__Letter "well here i am, listening to the newbie chat and waiting for you to get up. I'm guessing you probably slept through your alarm. But that's fine, I don't mind it. I know you need your sleep. And plus, what more can i ask for when i get to spend nearly every hour of every day this week just being with you? :)I'm gonna stay on for another 10 minutes or so (that's 6pm), and then if you still haven't unidled then i'll assume that you are happily dreaming of me and i will see you tonight. Your princess,Heather"
