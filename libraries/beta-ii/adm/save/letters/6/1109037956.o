__Letter "Hey there... I'm back at my place, for the moment.Car tire blew out / shredded / disentigrated on me last night, on the way home from the airport. The temp was so low that the rim froze to the car, and it had to be flat-bed towed (after two hours in -6 weather, I was ok with that), and I was in a hotel.Well, my rim didn't get destroyed by the good samaritans (one nice man and his wife stopped, and were great. The state person had a big male-ego thing going, and wouldn't stop kicking, pushing, prying and generally being MALE)However, I was safe, which is good. I was pretty tweaked up about it last night / today, until I got my car back around noon, and finally drove back to my place. Nice snowstorm to greet me back into Maine, too!Anyway, they're flying me back to Ohio on Sunday evening, for another weekish. This testing's really important, and I need to be near developers (rather than phone/email-tag). What's going on at work? Who'd you unload on? What happened? How ARE you?I'm going to turn Trillian on, but I don't know if I'll be around a lot. I didn't sleep much last night, and I'm wiped. :)I am getting a raise this year (cheers, because raises are ALWAYS preferable to layoffs). Nothing huge, but I'm happy :) And I get a nice bonus, too. Wasn't expecting that one.Apparently, I also get vacation time paid out this Friday... so... it's going to be quite a nice off-paycheck week. :) (my normal pay is every other week, with next week being the next one)So, that's good news. Putting that into savings, too.Man, I missed the critters.Tag.-H"
