__Letter "Hey escobar. Our fearless leader. I've been told that you have an extra black dagger. I was wondering if I could borrow it. I've decided to stick with black daggers for now. At least untill everything autoloads for me. Only two locker spaces! Maybe when they AL, I can borrow your wolf claws again? Thanks so much!"
