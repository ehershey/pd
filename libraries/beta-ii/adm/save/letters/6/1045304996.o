__Letter "Note: This was before all of this started. Even NS was still here when I wrote you this.Stormy,I know you're tired of me now.  I bother you so much and give you so much crap that I'm really amazed you haven't gone off at me by now.  A testiment to your patience to be sure.But here is what I consider to be my final suggestion in my long, unending line of suggestions.Unlike my other ideas, this one actually gives you less work instead of more work if you decide to impliment it.Look, I'm not trying to be egotistical, but I'm pretty much three for three on ideas right now.The heal spell, bear, and espically AC adjustment have all been adopted by you. Add the readdition of acid rain and I'd say that I have more god ideas then bad... At least when it comes to the mud.I'm also rather dedicated to this mud and am skilled in C++ and Java.  Plus, I'm learning LPC at a fast clip and to prove it have a brand new spell all play tested for you to put in after balancing is worked out.the game(This new spell is called Ball and I'll go over it with you tomorrow if you wish.)In any case, if you look in any text book on science, it tells you that one of the most important part in any scientific progress is field tests.Do the guys go out in the field with their goofy glasses and make things blow up? No, they give it to competant field engineers who blow it up for them and then return them the results.You are a very good, and intelligent admin, and a good man in my opinion.  But, even Einstien needed to have his stuff field test and as smart and dedicated as you are, you are only human.Your adjustments have had some problems in the opinion of quite a few people including me.  I point to thornwrack as a pristine example of overadjustment.  It was to powerful at first, now it takes me 17 castings of it to kill a 60k monster at level 50 with max nature, magic attack, and damn high wisdom.And this is just a sample.  On the whole, despite your best efforts, this mud is way underbalanced. Is this your fault? Hell No!You are one man, you have a family, you have a life.And you are devoid of all the data.Hince my solution, what I like to call the Player Perspective.My idea calls for me to become an immortal, the reasoning for this will be made clear in the presentation.Basically I would become Hermes, the mechanical man!I would pick a class, let's pretend I'd pick fighter and Paladin.Then I'd wonder around for the next two weeks playing with it.  I'd XP my way up to around level 50 to level 60  trying out everything about the class.I'd make notes, make out a report, and then present my recommendations to you on what needed to be adjusted.Then, with whatever changes you make, I could adjust the aspects. Or, if you don't want me to you could adjust them and just use my report as a starting point.Now, why immortal?Simple, it drasticly cuts timeMost of the XPing is made up of raising skills and stats, but most espically stas.If I know that an average fighter of level 30 has around 40-50 in stats, do I want to spend a week trying to raise my stats up as this is a week I could be doing other, more productive things? No.  I would make the call and change my stats (I know what you're thinking, but Wraith had a suggestion on this part which will be made clear soon.)The most important thing is I would be your field engineer! If you had something to test, then I would do it.  If you had a change to make, I would help you work out the bugs.Remember when AC was changed and at first no monsters anywhere did any sort of damage whatsoever? Well, with a playtester, that problem could have been quickly isolated and solved (In fact, if you'll ask Daos, I'm the first one who alerted him to the fact that the monsters were dealing out 10 damage when they should be doing 150)And as ball proves, I could also make new spells and with your approval, begin to enhance the mud.  instead of writing new areas like everyone else, I could be adding new abilities, new spells, hell maybe even new classes or subclasses?Although that would be a secondary function at most, the primary function would be to help *you* balance.Part 2 to follow"
