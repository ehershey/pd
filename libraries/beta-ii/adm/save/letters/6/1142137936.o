__Letter "hey man..cortoth does 1k to me, i do 500 dmg to him, im way behind on skills and stats but dood..i think the damage is fair. its like the old gore you know. AND WE ARE DRAGONS...so we do deserve something like this..HOWEVER. i think the sp cost should be increased man..its not nearly high enough still. its doing about 40-80sp it should be double that considering how good it is and how slow our fat asses are"
