__Letter "Hey, i'm sorry for how i was acting last night, and i'm even more sorry for that outburst... I'm afraid that i scared you a little last night. I hope i didn't but i'm worried i did. But regardless its how i get when i'm in a very lonely/depressed state. All i wanted last night was to be held by you so badly. And right after you logged off i cried. I feel so childish and foolish with all of these silly sad emotions but i can't control it sometimes. But every second i'm with you i feel a million times better than when i do sitting here alone. You did cheer me up alot last night, but i was just so fustrated at myself from missing you constantly yesterday i just just beating myself up on the inside. And again, i'm sorry for that outburst i said about wishing something. I truly hope i didnt push you away, that is the absoluete last thing i want right now. I just want to know you in every way there is to know a person, and i see this potentially going all the way... I'm sorry i am doing it again agh... I miss you, i'm going to force myself awake early tommorow so i can talk to you when you first get on in the morning if you do. Maybe i'll have another dream of us.... Anyways this is getting alot longer than intended so i shall talk to you tommorow. I miss you dearly Rayna..."
