__Letter "hello, bot on here and you were 7 minutes idle, i have to havea shower now. But, i will return.I just wanted you to know that i tend to keep my feelingshidden when i like someone, in case they don't return myfeelings. you don't want to feel like a fool is the otherperson says they don't like you the same way.When you said you liked me, i was happy and was hoping byour getting to know each other better, we would both feelcomfortable and know that it would be mutual. I liked you too,but I didn't want to ruin it or jinx it. I like you a lot,and we both have been hurt in the past and i know I was beingcareful not to scare you off.Also, too with the other guy here, he intimidated me andscared me, so I was always explaining myself. I think you are so caring and thoughtful and sweet to me. I want to getto know the Chris behind the Endbringer. That is who I comeon to talk to. Endy is a bonus.hugs, talk to you when i get back on.xoxo"
