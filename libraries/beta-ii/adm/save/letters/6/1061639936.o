__Letter "I would like to request having the character Prator back. If I remember correctly you were upset when I cided, maybe you thought it was a 'statement' or something. It wasn't. I had gotten tired of PD for a few reasons, first, because lvl83 things were like 500 times as expensive as they were at lower levels and stuff, my spells had maxed out and all that. Second, I had just died, which sucked. Third, very very good friend of mine was leaving from PD because of family stuff, and I wouldn't be able to talk through email or anything, which really sucked. So I didn't feel like playing anymore because them leaving took the fun out of it for me.Oh yeah, and Drakule's cheating feeding and backstabbing by advancing when he had the extrememly hackless breathe, and dragon armour made him take 0 damage formm 40k mob idles and all that - anyway, levelling past me by the 15 levels in a day pissed me off, so there was nothing fun left, and everything was upsetting and basically all around bleh :-/However, I have gotten back to talking to that friend now, and everything is better, and I have also gotten back into playing PD. So I would very much like to be able to have that Prator char back, as he was after dying. I still remember all stats and skills. Hah, you get to remember them when you put that much effort into it.Strength: 80Dexterity: 60Constituion: 85Wisdom: 100Intelligence: 105Charisma: 60Level80 with maxed skills of defense, magic defense, faith, healing, belief.100 conjuring317 Magic attack60 blade100 flying90 bargaining.Umm, yeah. That's it. So, please?"
