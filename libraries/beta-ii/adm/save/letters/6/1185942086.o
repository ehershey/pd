__Letter "dude lemme know if this is good for yaYou look upon what seems to be the figure of a man.  As you step closer, your heart beats faster as if it were warning you of some unexplained evil.  You clench your weapon waiting for your opponent to strike when you notice blood escaping from a bloody mess that was once your chest.  Darkness clouds your vision as your ears pick up a voice that only could have come from Hell itself saying \"Return to dust, you cursed land lover!\" Yin aka Bam"
