__Letter "hey i was bugged today, I PKed someone in rhondale, and it marked me as outlaw.  Then, it spammed the mud b/c it said i was wanted for death... and it would not kill me, then finally it killed me and i should not have been, as Rhondale is a PK area.  I have a list of my inventory, and I only lost 2 stats, but lost 3 lvls and the skills with them.  As this is a PD related bug, I would appreciate if I could get my inventory back, there were LOTS of unidles at the time, piehl, nulvect, furiae, clyde, pal and many many others. It was pal's alt i killed, b/c he allowed me to do so, so we went to rhondale.  he was with me."
