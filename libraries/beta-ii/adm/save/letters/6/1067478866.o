__Letter "Never speaking, still awake,Pleasing most when most I speak,The Delight of old and young,Tho' I speak without a Tongue.Nought but one Thing can confound me,Many Voices joining round meThen I fret, and rave and gabble,Like the Labourers of Babel.Now I am a Dog, or Cow,I can bark, or I can low,I can bleat, or I can sing,Like the Warblers of the Spring.Let the Love-sick Bard complain,And I mourn the cruel PainLet the happy Swain rejoice,And I join my helping VoiceBoth are welcome, Grief or Joy,I with either sport and toy.Tho' a Lady, I am stout,Drums and Trumpets bring me outThen I clash and roar, and rattle,Join in all the Din of Battle.Jove, with all his loudest Thunder,When I'm vext, can't keep me underYet so tender is my Ear,That the lowest Voice I fearMuch I dread the Courtier's Fate,When his Merit's out of Date,For I hate a silent Breath,And a Whisper is my Death."
