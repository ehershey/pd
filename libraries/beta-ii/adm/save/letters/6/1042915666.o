__Letter "Hey honey! My dearest brother in law let me use his computer to play the mud. *cheers* only problem is that you're asleep right now. :( Well, just checking in with you. What did you think of the room i came up with? Did you like it? I've got the bedroom designed now, but I'll have to tell you about it later. I don't really have the time right now. Love ya and miss ya,Savannah"
