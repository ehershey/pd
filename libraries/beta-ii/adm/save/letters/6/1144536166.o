__Letter "sorry to see you go, though don't really blame you either...  arma seems to have single handedly started a guild war between darksoul and dragonwarriors and several members are trying to pressure me into backing the guild...  Agnidev, incedentally is not one of them.  Been hanging around, trying to help the ones not wanting to get involved to better be able to defend themselves, but have nearly resigned on a couple occasions.  Of course if i do resign, i'll probably go guildless like i was for so long.  Guild leadership seems to keep getting thrust on me... Why is it that people always want the strongest characters to be their guild leaders?  Anyway, I hear arma stole one of your diamonds.  I you need one, i bought 2 off of arma not too long ago - they might be yours - let me know if you need any."
