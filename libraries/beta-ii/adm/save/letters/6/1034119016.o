__Letter "Talked to Stormy last night.  Nice long talk and he promised to make some changes.  He says he changed holyfire so I wanna test it on you and see how it does and he also nerfed flameclaw big time.  Nothing about charge/stun/slash which I did not bring up as I can live with that.Oh, dump leafmailYou can now use Darkmail in the place as leafmail for a \"chainmail\"It has a little bit less AC, but even if it's 1 or 2 less. You can wear fucking darkmail over spideramour. How cool is that?In any case, you and I need to get our asses in gear and get me spider armour from the drow general.  I don't know how yet, probably will involve a cleric and para/peaceLet's talk to Mocha or somethingIn any case.  Seeya whenever buddy."
