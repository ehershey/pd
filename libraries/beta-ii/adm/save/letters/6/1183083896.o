__Letter "There are several problems with your areas.First off, you didn't use headers. This is required. Most of uswho are around on builders can show you how to do this.Secondly, your rooms have several typos as well as spelling and grammarmistakes. Several per room, that is.Thirdly, you describe little or none of the nouns in the room.Fourthly, these areas have absolutely nothing in them. No monsters,no items, nothing special to do.All of these things must be addressed before these would even beconsidered to be put in. We do appreciate the work, but we want quality,not just quantity. If you need help with any of this stuff, again,most people on builders can help you. The pd line available to talkto the imms on the main port as well.As for becoming immortal... I don't think anyone even knows who you are.Writing areas does not make you an instant imm on the main port,it is simply one way to gauge your skills (and not just coding)."
