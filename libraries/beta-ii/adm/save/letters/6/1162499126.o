__Letter "I could easily rewire the set_value() function in object.c toautomatically set the same part of the object's mapping thatset_curr_value() does. I would simply make it automaticallyset it to value[\"gold\"] = value; the way set_curr_value() does butwithout the requested TYPE named. set_value() would automaticallyassume the gold standard is implied. Least once i was done itwill :PIronman"
