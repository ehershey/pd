__Letter "What a mess! This room looks like a tornado hit it! As you look around theroom, you cant imagine a messier place on the planet! There is only one spot inthe room that isn't messy, there is a bed against the far wall with pictures ofMathiu's family.  You Then hear a booming voice in your head saying, \"Who DareDisturb The Room of Mathiu!\" You decide to leave the room at once."
