__Letter "In the interests of people not being rude and insulting me EVERY time I post, could you just tell me when you think my post is just a big complaint. You are the only person who has been nice to me so far.I swear, either I am way too good at writing for my own good, most people here are stupid or they don't remember dug from english in high school.It is too bad everyone decides to ignore me when I compliment you guys, everyone seemed to skip over the 'PD is cool' part of my post. Anyway, sorry to bother you with such trivial concerns, can't fix peoples attitudes when they aren't around ey?Once again, like the paladins, can't wait to see the new stuff.	- Aziraphale likes PD, too bad about the players (j/k)"
