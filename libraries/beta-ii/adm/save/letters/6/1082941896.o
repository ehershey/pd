__Letter "ok, I'm a little mad about this, aziraphale just pked gob with smite, it is my understanding that smite is a finishing move, and not to be used to insta an elite rogue with over 1k hp. Ignoring aziraphale's previous law infracktion(which even I admit are suspicous) this I feel is bug abuse, and should be investigated."
