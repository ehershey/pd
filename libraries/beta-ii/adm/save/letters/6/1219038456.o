__Letter "peachy keen jelly bean. Sorry I wasn't on, not keeping this alt anyway.I was having a bad today, had an anxiety attack and was resting up.I think a lot of it was I felt pressured to help them out.I might have helped them out somewhere down the road, but not rightnow. I have always been able to work things out, with some help from others.But, I don't hate either of them, right now I don't want to talk to either ofthem in any way, shape or form. Maybe once I get through this, I can.I feel I've let you down. But, the thought of having to talk to either of them right now was extremelyhard, because i didn't get to sleep until 3am and was having chest pains.I finally slept until 6 and then went back to bed as 8 and slept until noon.I had to take a pill.I'm tired, but may come on tomorrow if i go to physiomiss youhugs"
