__Letter "Wondered how you've been... You haven't been about. If you haven't, consider using AIM? I KNOW that's on all the time... I've changed/shifted AIM id's, because everyone and their brother had SunMoonStorm, apparently. :) You can reach me at Waliing.*snuggles into her NJ Devils hockey jersey* I love this :) It's so totally me. :)Oi. Long day going through financial proposals, state budget information and ROI (return on investment) docs, trying to figure out why none of them total the same amounts. It gives me a headache. I hate figuring out my OWN finances. Let alone screwing with something that costs more than I'll make in 20 years. :) Or 40. :)I picked up some cedar potpourri today. Not the cheap wood chip stuff, but NICE stuff. :) Smells so good.That's going in the kitchen. I have a nice little wicker tray for it. I also have a painting to hang in there soon. :)Ah, bah. I doubt you care about me decorating, for the first time ever :)I've missed you.-H"
