__Letter "I just wanted to toss an idea out to you fellas.What would you guys think about setting up another position forbuilders between Creator and Mortal called Tester ??This posts responsibility will be to help the builders by p-testingtheir areas and giving feedback. I can set the position up myselfbut i wanted your permission before i do it.The only commands beyond the mortal ones I would grant them isac, wc, stat, objcmds, and summary. This way they can SCAN the infofrom the area but not read or alter the files. It would also allowthe builder to lockout or permit them to access this info due tothe security_screen() s-fun i wrote into those commands.I think it would be benificial to get non-coder feedback on theareas since some coders like Hep and myself perfer to code overactually playing the mud :PMail me back with your opinions please.I will leave the final vertict to whit and stormbringer as to ifi will go ahead and set up this system or not.Ironman"
