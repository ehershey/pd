__Letter "wisp was having the same problem. if you can't wear it by typing wear all, wear everything individually, If this doesn't work, try quitting out. If you can't quit out cause you're holding mikolai's stuff, then yeah....can't do much until you can :Pbut wearing all wearable items one by one should do the trick. start with wearing your soul stone, then the saddle, and go from there.Helena."
