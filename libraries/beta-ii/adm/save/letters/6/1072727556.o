Several rules to apply topking:        1) Repeated killing of a player by a person/group is            considered harrassment.        2) You must be at level 20 to PK or to be PKed.        3) PK sprees are not allowed.  A PK spree is considered            to be when a player kills every player insight.             Failure to follow this rule will result in immediate            destment, and banishment.Failure to comply with the rules will result in punishment.  The type ofpunishment administered will be at the descretion of the administrator online.Shadimar has already been arrested for abusing a bug to kill me in town.  I think he's in the 0 tolerence zone.Shadimar is being a classic griefer.  He is trying to ruin the game for people which is not in the spirit of PvP at all.  Also, he may not have broken Multiplay or PK rules word for word, but he has violated the principles of both.  I reccomend that he lose all his characters at the very least for abusing them.Melphista wants to quit, which sucks because she's never done anything bad to anyone.Leviathas"
