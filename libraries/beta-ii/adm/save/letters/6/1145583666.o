__Letter "I posted some of my thoughts about the two players on the board. I will not respond to either of them, they know they did something wrong and are just trying to go over my head in hopes of getting me in trouble, or get themselves back on or something. To quote vyce \"This is shameful behavior and a disgrace to the ideal that was supposed to have been Primal Darkness.\" I have never seen anything as disgraceful as Vyce. He was truely scum. And just to refute his claim, right now there are around 16 players on right now, and thats becoming an average, before he was dested it was closer to 7 or less. Vyce was the plague.I will defend both Nesoo and I's performance to the end, everything we have done has been right, and following our own understanding of the rules. I will not apologize for our actions, they were all done with the good of the mud in mind. I must say, after reading his e-mail, I was sickened, although not surprised. Of course, it is all up to you, but from where I stand, and no doubt Nesoo stands, all of our desicions were right. I ask that you back us on the main board so we can put an end to all the arguments about what nesoo and I have done in punishing those that break the rules."
