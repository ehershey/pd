__Letter "Hello love, I meant to send this before midnight, but eventsconspired against me! As it stands, I'll send it a little late. :)Happy Thanksgiving!!! We call it Turkey Day over here as that birdis a prominent part of our traditional feast. I wonder, doeseveryone usually eat turkey in Canada? I know you wouldn't, beingveggie and all. Maybe you had a nice Tofurkey? Whatever you had,I hope it was scrumptious and a fun time had by all. :)__________________________________________________________________Work is going ok, a guy got written up for falsifying records andI am currently waiting on him. He got himself and the supervisorsin trouble behind it. So, this one may be a challenge. Otherwise,things are groovy. I went to cell tonight. It's like a biblestudy meeting with church members in your community. Myra wenttoo. It was fun. :) Anyhow, I will cut this short and look for youTuesday sometime, yay! :)Take care and have fun, love.All my love,Your James"
