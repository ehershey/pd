__Letter "ok man..i'll be straight. i remember what happened now..joey and utaku were fighting..about arena..she was being cocky. and joey lost in arena..joeys a real good friend of mine for many years nowso i tried basic passwords..see if i could get it. and avenge joey. im sorry.i wanted to help joey out. i really dont know utaku at all. i didnt mean to lie about it. i honestly forgot about it. and the accusation of it being yesterday..confused me.im really sorry to utaku. it was nothing personal. i have no grudges against anyone here.i truly miss my character..i swear to GOD it wont happen again. it was a stupid idea..i was probably baked at the time.i do not mean to cause trouble"
