__Letter "Hey love, I know you mean to be on more, but please don't worryabout anything. :) I got my head on straight and have settledwith the fact that you need copious amounts of rest! We want youhealthy, we want what's best for you. Listen to me say we likeI'm Gollum talking about the precioussss! Those tricksy hobbitses!At any rate, get your rest and I will be on when I can, you'll beon when you can, so we'll be on when we can. :) You may wanna invest in a chair with some arms so you don't goplopping onto the floor. :) Just an idea. :) I will keep you in mythoughts and prayers and wishes, so I gotcha covered three ways! :)All my love,Your James"
