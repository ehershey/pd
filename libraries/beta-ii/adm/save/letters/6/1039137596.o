__Letter "I read this thing and I want to know if you think it is any good.                    Life By: Kristi Vincent\"If God had a face, what would it look like, and would you wanna see, cause if you see it then you'll have to believe, in all his glory.\" To me these words emphasize the human instinct to want to see something before you will believe in it. It is saying that most humans will not accept what they cannot see, hear, or touch. It has been this way since almost the beginning of time. They do not want to believe that there is a higher power somewhere that is more powerful than their money, houses, diamonds, and all their luxuries. They spend so much money; it drives them to think it will bring them happiness. They are driven away from their families, their children, and anyone close to them, because when they are worried or sad, they simply use their money to make the people around them happy. It makes the people around them spoiled, and keeps from knowing all the real happiness in life. They become so spoiled in money and things that they no longer take the time to appreciate the real things in life. The little things, that is something that is ignored by many people, there are not many that appreciate them anymore. All many people care about is there money, cars, houses, diamonds, and all the other riches they can buy. They do not take the time to simply make a home-cooked meal because they are so spoiled by society today that they go to a big-name chain restaurant such as \"McDonalds\" and buy a cheap $3.00 hamburger that takes less than a minute to make, instead of taking at least one hour of their lives and cooking one themselves. Most people walk outside look at the sky, and do not think much, they do not take the time to appreciate the night sky and how one day, there won't be anything left on Earth, the sun will explode and leave a huge ball of nothing floating in space. If you were to float away you would at first see your house, all the people in it, then you'd gradually start to drift farther and farther away, seeing things like, your town, your state, and even your country, get smaller and smaller. You would then float out and hover over the Earth and see all the little ant like people on it, as you drift on out, you would then notice Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. As you start to hover over the entire universe you would start to notice that the people on Earth are nothing. The Earth is so small compared to even some of the other planets, such as Jupiter or Saturn, but even compared to the entire universe, we're nothing. People think that they are all big and bad, but in reality, we are not anything. We are small things stuck by gravity to a tiny rock floating in a huge universe. We are not much of anything, it is just in our minds that we are. We may be something on Earth, but when you think of the big picture, we are nothing, and will always be that way. Many people do not take the time to think about life. I am not talking about what you do socially or anything, I am talking about life itself, the human life. It is actually very amazing, you start out as an egg, which is made inside someone's body, you grow, are fed the things you need to live, and eventually you shape into a baby with arms and legs and a head. Finally you come out of your mothers' body, which as I've heard is pretty painful. But, that is very amazing that two people can create another human out of almost nothing. It's almost like growing a bean plant, you first need the seed and fertilizer, then you plant it inside the cup, water and feed it, then it starts to grow, eventually it will become ready to face the harshness of the world and will bloom and will be able to remove from the cup and be planted in the Earth. Life is amazing; you are able to move your hands, your fingers, toes, and all other parts. I always wonder how we are able to do that. You can move your fingers and your toes at the same time, you have all these cells and things in your body that keep you living, with just one slip you could die, you could lost a limb, or paralyze yourself. All in all the process of life that we live is amazing, We each have our own personalities and we all have that one special someone that is out there that we will one day share our life's with. When you think about it, you being on the Earth is amazing. It's amazing that one person can mean so much, that one person could change everything, that one person could be the reason if you will live or die.In this day and age, asking someone what they want to be when they grow up is not what I think people should be doing. Of course everyone wants to grow up, but now, in the society we live in, we do not know what will happen today or tomorrow. There are so many fights, shootings, bombings, and hatred that could take anyone down. The criminals today are becoming very advanced with the things they do, and could kill someone and make it as though it never happened. In this day and age, we should be asking, If we grow up, not when.Sorry if it's so long, or hard to read.Mocha."
