__Letter "i accidently tried to pk some ethereal members in a safety zone. i've already been 30 day temp banned for pking leviathas in a safety zone..i didn't realize i was in a safety zone though.noone died...i left when i realized my spells weren't hitting them and only my undeads were doing the damage.its kinda spammy when u got 5 monsters hittin multiple times per round and their hits too. i didnt realize what was goin down. but i caught it in time and noone died.if i should be punished..errm...i dont think i deserve it..but if i am..well im sorry. so yeah. later"
