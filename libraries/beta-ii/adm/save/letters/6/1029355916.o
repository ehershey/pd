__Letter "Sir, I have found yuor guild. For it was very simply once I look at it carefully. The place where the earth conqours the sun is the part that got me. You see I merly had to think of the sun as not relating to the mud. In this case a place where the earth would be conqouring the sun would be when the sun is down or setting other wise known as dusk. This is where I had to relate it back to the mud. I regret that this part took me awhile to find. For when I did I found myself at the gate of dusk. For this part was the most challenging of all. For there is not much at the gate of dusk. Until I read the rest of the clue that your guild is underneath the gate of dusk. It was then that I saw that small crack, this part took me while to get into but I finally have. For it is then that I found yuor guild. If I might add I most admire the colors you have used in your guild room description.Buffy."
