__Letter "alright - here's a description of the green/jade in his man form. \" Straight black hair cascades down the man's back, two wisps gently framing his smooth oval face. His clothing is striking, a long robe which flows around his body makes it impossible to discern whether or not he may conceal something. Jade green eyes calm and steady seem to see past you, as though you were nothing of importance to him. A low rumble eminates from deep within his chest as he moves off away from you.\" "
