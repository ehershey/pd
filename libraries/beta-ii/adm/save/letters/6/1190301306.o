__Letter "read 35Message 35 by Aizen: \"Douche!\"=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=I am for a better lack of words, Pissed off.  There is no way Noxus should havebeen booted if he killed his guild mate that's one thing but because he calledsomeone a douche. If you boot someone out of a guild you hardly are a member ofyourself, guess what YOU ARE A DOUCHE. If you talk smack as an alt and thenwhen invited to back up said smack in Merk, YOU ARE A DOUCHE. I am trying tounderstand how such a douche gets to be on the guild council. I am also tryingto see why the hell we have so many inactive members, but are only allowed onealt to the guild. So if you are bouncing around as an alt don't expect to beshowed any DS love, unless that alt is DS. I see very little RP on this mud,but that needs to be looked at. So if calling Zach a douche gets people bootedout of this guild, consider me gone because judging by what happen ZACK IS ADOUCHE. And if Zach cares to talk about it on a personal note my address is 109Will Pimp Your Ass Rd, Merk, PD 31213 and my office is ALWAYS open.Aizen=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+="
