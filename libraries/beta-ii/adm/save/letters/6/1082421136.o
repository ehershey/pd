__Letter "i'm not 100% sure what happened, but me and sasayaki think that the reboot might have broken them, because when we came back from reboot they were broken and not creating the save file in my dir.i made a copy of the wings myself and put a working copy in my dir /wizards/helena/custom/wing.c you can delete your copy now :P otherwise when tsuke logs in or comes back from being link-dead or something, he'll end up with two pairs of wings....or he may not, but i think we should be safe :PThanksHelena"
