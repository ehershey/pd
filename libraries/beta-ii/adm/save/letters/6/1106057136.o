__Letter "Ahoy mate. We should work together and get us a nice guild hall set-up. Now your alot beter coder than I but I do know some, my strength lies in ideas and descriptions. So when we both have some free time we should get together and plan out some ideas not just for the main hall but others rooms for things we will get later. (like guild store, and guild oil/stones person, treasury of course and a locker room if possible."
