__Letter "Yesterday Smite and I went and attacked Scourge in rhondale with Breath+Firebomb, Aziraphale got gated in by Kya, a few rounds later Scourge went L/D to avoid death, then about 5 rounds later Aziraphale did the same. When Aziraphale logged back on he told me to go east of square, and cuz the 2 of us were still \"attacking eachother\" from the rhondale incident he was able to pk me.Insert from rule number 4: PK in a nopk zone such as Tirun is also illegal and is considered bug abuse.Insert from rulle number 3: Exploiting bugs is not allowed. Any who exploits bugs shall have all their characters deleted for cheating."
