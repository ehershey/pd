__Letter "Depressing depressing... life is one big black hole, isn't it? Had to leave the square earlier -- people making your new girlfriend a conversation topic. It made me sad, so I left... then Seeker and Leviathas were making jokes about me. Seeker was kidding, Leviathas can fuck himself.Roy's ignoring me, but really, what's new about that? People keep fucking me over left and right. I give up on love and trust. I should have stayed introverted like I used to be. You can't have your cake and eat it to. You can't want to be around people yet not expect to get hurt.Maybe I'm naive... maybe I'm stupid for thinking \"Oh, he/she might be different\"... but I do it time after time, and get hurt over and over until I feel so fucking useless.I have to go to the dentist tomorrow... plus I have school. Woo fucking hoo.- Jen"
