__Letter "Daboura,You've probably noticed that I haven't been around much lately.  I've come to a conclusion as to why.I work really hard for school, and need to spend time with my friends, and when I sign on here it's like I get blamed for ten thousand different things from the players, but I thought 'This is still okay.  I'm like a net that catches a whole load of bullshit so that Daboura and Nesoo don't have to deal with it.  I'm being productive.'But then I got reprimanded by you, and that hurts.  'Ingore Carina' I believe were my orders.  If I wasn't giving special treatment before, I'd certainly be doing it now.  Carina has the tendency to involve herself in all sorts of issues that are none of her business.  I was essentially degraded to dealing with Law cases in which she had no part.  This is increasingly difficult.  And if I enforced on any of her friends or guild mates, then she'd certainly jump in. Carina has basically won.  This is her MUD.  She has disrespected the administration on several occassions.  She has done more damage/evil to the MUD than any other player, creating a huge rift between the staff and the players.  I just can't work under these conditions.  You've tied my hands, hands which were never permitted to do much of anything to begin with.LeviP.S.  Should this be my resignation?  You decide."
