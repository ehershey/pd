__Letter "PvP Damage is full of crap. For the Role I chose to play on this mud I have to work over 2 times as hard to get to where I like my charater to be. I live for PvP combat and that is what my goals are set on. I don't see why PvP damage has to be different from player vs mob damage. If a lower lvl get PKed from a higher lvl it's probably because the lower lvl got the higher lvl mad or because the higher lvl was in ROLE.I thought the lvl in \"who\" was taken out to increase ROLE PLAYING.Now if a lower player kills a higher lvl that means either the higher lvl sucks or the lower lvl worked his butt off to build his charater.All I know is my Role is to be that lower lvl who can kick the crap out of higher lvls. I love to do that and that is my Pride and Joy to play. and when I mean be the lower lvl I mean at least 10 lvls lower.I was told that PvP damage was implamented because PvP dmg almost solely depended on who got the first hit in. As a Rogue Assassin that is my life is the first strike on a player. If I don't get the first strike in and kill. Then I have no choice but to run. Yet I think that is the way it should be. My Title Again is \"ASSASSIN\". I don't know about you but I don't know many assassins who miss the first strike stick around for another round. We are suposed to be 1 hit killers and if we are good we should stay as a 1 hit killer. Now I have to work over 2 times as hard to play my role and I really do not like that. My role life as a assassin is my Backstab. I don't really care how much damage I can do in a round cause for a good rogue there shouldn't be a round 2.That is how I feel as A Rogue AssassinIf you are worried about the first strike then I think you should just take out PK from the mud and bring back the oldPvP damage in the arena. The First Strike is the Life of a Rogue. It should be hard enough to kill someone 5 times your lvl but to go after someone 10 times you lvl is even harder. Yakko WarnerHas to work 2 times harder to play his role"
