__Letter "I haven't had a chance to speak to you yet about my being a rouge archangel.I have since chosen monk, (3 days of being level 5 with no moves will do that :) ). And I am already regretting it a bit. I  really really want to play the fallen angel. I am even willing to go level 1 and reroll stats for it. Anyway I won't make this another long as post. Even if the answer is a deffinate NO then could you send me a mud mail so I know. And if you want to speak to me about it mail me or grab me on AIM Name: Kenscythe. I'm almost always on. Anyway like I said I don't mind if the answer is no I just really want to know is all. Anyways speak to you when I see you.()Halo"
