__Letter "Don't have an issue with it at all. Wanna help on the main portfor awhile. Only thing is my time might be divided with helpingbuilders. Got the tutorials to the point that it's almost self-explanatory now. Plus they can work together if they wish.Mail system is getting done in parts. Only concern i have is thatthe player_mail object's need to be safe-guarded. Wouldn't thinkan imm would go poking around in them but i would be concerned iffor some reason we got a bad apple. It's mainly for the buildersport im concerned about for this. Since a builder isn't always astaff member. Part of the reason the file_names on the current mailsystem was a semi-randomize number was to scramble what mail belongedto whom.Lemme know if you want to worry about that kinda issue stormy. I cancode it either way.As for imm in general, zap me when ya ready stormy/nulvect :PMight not be paying attention here on the mail but you can catch meon builders if this ironman is logged in.Ironman"
