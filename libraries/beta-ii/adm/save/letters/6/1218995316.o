__Letter "OK. I have the line working the way you told me you wanted it to.It has a report for line colors and line status.It also has it built in so that people can toggle all their lineson and off like the old _lines.c did.Pyro made a few other suggestions on the board in my room as well.Please review these and see if you want them added into the command."
