__Letter "you have been on my brain lately!!!! I miss you so much! (sigh) i am sorry a thousand times for not being able to keep contact here in japan - my life has been crazy busy. But I wanted to at least drop a line to letcha know that you are on my mind. I would like to get together sometime in the future, hang out, etc. anyway... I will be back in Minnesota on August 1st. I:ll be around much more then , though i already have artistic comissions lined up. sorry for the poor spelling, etc... :m still stuck on a japanese keyboard and on telnet. haha. love you!!jenna/azire"
