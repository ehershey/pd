__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Hepualahaole to Hepualahaole Tue Nov 16 21:45:27 2004:-----9 orbs totalYou need to get all 9, as you get them they merge into one orb4 orbs (black, blue, red, white) will be off of statues, you need to give the proper respect to each.  Exaple offer poisin to black, offer salve to white, offer lit torch to red, and offer water to blue5 orbs will be gotten from random deeds...since a dragon is wise in all thingsWhen all 9 orbs are blended, a clue would appear (don't know what that may be yet)But I should note here, the 9 orbs will create one eggPart one of the quest finishedPart two of the questFind the living dragon you wish to becomeconfront it (in just about every dragon book I have...they like riddles)Pass the testGive the orb to the dragonDie (not sure how yet)You find yourself in the orbHatch outYou see your corpse on the ground but your soul in another bodyReally really really basic outline tell me what ya think?"
