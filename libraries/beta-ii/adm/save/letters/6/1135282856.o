__Letter "Lol, it's no problem, Niruku is a friend of mine in real life so incase I'm not on you can always ask him for help, he said he didn't mind. And no worries about getting lost, everyone does in these games, but remember, if you are level 1-5 you can just type in recall to get to the town square ([]). And trust me, you're probably doing A LOT better than me when I first started off :)Josh"
