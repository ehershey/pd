__Letter "I'm sorry, it's just that I am concerned that you might feel bad. I don't meen to pry into your personal life, I just thought that if there was something wrong you may like to rant about it, as people often want to do. If you'd like for me to never ask nor appear inquisitive as to your life again, then I shall not do so, and I can instruct guild members not to inquire into your current state (at the very least over the line).Again, I'm really sorry."
