__Letter "Hey this is Eios and I just have to say a few thing in my defense. First of all Faust has never killed Seth ever and they only character of mine Faust has killed is Eios. When I killed him yesterday it was pay back from Faust killing Eios not Seth. Yes I know the multi-play pk rules and I didn't and haven't ever broken them ever on this mud. I would like my characters back full restored for the fact that you have dested them for something I did not do."
