__Letter "I have this weekend off, and Dabby has every weekend off, so it should work out for both of us... Haven't talked to him about it yet though, as he has school after work Mon-Thu. Friday night prolly won't work so well either, as it will be my first weekend off in the last month, so we'll prolly be at a bar or something."
