__Letter "Oh god I had another episode with Tsu.  She lied and told me Jonah was offline, not realizing I was capable of seeing people who have me blocked.  Then she came up with some lame ass excuse like she accidentally had him on block.  I was REALLY REALLY MEAN and actually felt kind of bad but this just sums up how much of a fraud she is:Leviathas: Oh by the way.  I know I'm not hurting you.  I don't take pleasure in that at all.Leviathas: I honestly don't believe you ever hurt.  I'm doing this for my benefit.LavanderLuck: perhaps if you had net meeting .......these tears would be invisible as well......Leviathas: You're lying to me again.LavanderLuck: no........Leviathas: And if you felt bad, you wouldn't keep coming back the same.  You'd change.Leviathas: You can't go from laughing your ass off at me to crying.LavanderLuck: i have changedLeviathas: I'm not convinced.LavanderLuck: go awayTears?  Tsu?  Not fucking likely.  That was RP.  I summed her up in the previous discussion and she went and did exactly what I bitched at her for doing every time."
