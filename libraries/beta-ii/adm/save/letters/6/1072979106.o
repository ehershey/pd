__Letter "Umm, for some reason, when i died in the arena, i left like usual, then i went to tirun [], when i died for real??? What happened?? I think it might be some sort of bug but i think that it is unfair to lose levels and stuff when i died in the arena. Can you look into this for me??Cheers - Crem"
