__Letter "It was a public competition posted on the most public board.  Entries were to be submitted to one individual, true, but it was open to everyone and it stands to reason that it would end up in the paper which Hermes was making a big deal about around the same time.  Either way, it's bad.  Oh and I was just reminding of the obvious rules but if you can't read past my asshole act then you don't know me and you should have a seat and calm yourself down."
