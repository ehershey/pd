__Letter "\"I shake my head whilst rubbing my face in disbelief. Its still there and its still carrying on, a monotonous drone. The head shake only makes it worse. I half raise my left hand in protest but it ploughs on though, it never listens. *sigh*  fine, fine, fine I say to my self. I acknowledge it, the splendour of antiquity , the  softest touch and it withdraws, a sensation of something akin to joy. I raise my hand pressing finger on lips intoning silence. The gesture throws it off and an odd expression of bewilderment flashes. Only he can feel the kiss of warmth on skin, the sound familiar yet out of place, the flutter of clothes as wind whips. Shock doesn’t even register as flesh is pulped. Its silent now except for the wet rasping sound it makes. I shake my head and rub my face, it doesn’t have to be this way, it never does. I don’t like it but some times… some times it needs to be done. Now even the wet sucking sound has grown weak and it topples over, half thumping half splattering as it hit’s the ground. In a few weeks time there will be reports of a bus and how the driver could have swore he had hit something. The smashed headlight and damaged panels testament to his words. But the news will fade as no evidence can be found and a new urban legend will spring up. So quick to forget so quick to be forgotten. Ah well..\""
