__Letter "I've found that daos sent me an entire mudlib to my email, so I naturally ran out of space and my mailbox got closed down (in case you sent an email)  I figure I'll stick to mudmail for now.  How was thanksgiving?  Everything going well with the fam?  Had a good time here, cousins and I went to see harry potter after everything else.  Just wanted to let you know I was thinking of you.  *kiss*                           -Paul"
