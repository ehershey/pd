__Letter "We've patched things up, me and Josh. And it was onlyhis own duplicity that caused the rift. Anyway, weworked things out. I hope that you're ok. I knowthis has got to be like the hardest time in your life andI will always kick myself for adding to it. But, if youdon't mind letting me know your LiveJournal info, I'd likethat. I did enjoy talking to you last night even thoughthere were some heavy topics. I hope you feel stronger forgetting things off your chest with Josh. I hope you'llfeel set free. I really do want what's best for you.And if you ever wanna talk, I got 2 good ears and am readyto use em. I'll even clean the wax out for ya. :)Hugs,James"
