__Letter "Trust me bro. If we wish it to be done, I WILL be able to do it.It's mearly a question of IF we want it done. I was more thinkingof immortals who wish to share code than mortals tho. SImilar tohow the boards support it. Very simple matter to include it really.Check security >> read file >> mail itBut what you suggested about FTP protocals can be worked in later >:)wouldn't be to hard if we coded an FTP into the webpage. Basically builda part of the mailbox system into the webpage so people (with a character)could log on there and mail :)Food for thought :P"
