__Letter "Hey love, I am sorry that you haven't been feeling all that hotlately. :( (Always hot ta me, tho. >:)) Maybe a movie with thesister-in-law will do you good. I've been wanting to see you whenyou come online but my comp has been crashy lately and when thathappens, it undoes my most recent aliases in GMud, namely the onethat plays your song when Ayesha logs on. (meant trigger, not alias)Anyway, I will quit out and come back to make sure it takes. I hada weird dream last night with Will Smith (from I Am Legend and MenIn Black) in it. He was taking on a job as a waiter or somethingpreparing for a movie role. It was weird. Then he was seducing thischick...it was all scandalous! Anyway, that was the dream. I willtalk to you more when I get the chance. :) Have a great night, my Rayna. :)Love,Your James"
