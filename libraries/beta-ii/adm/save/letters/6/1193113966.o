__Letter "Hey Hep.  Just wanted to let you know we have our hotel booked for the 31st through the 3rd.  Talked to Kristi and she thinks it would be cool if we meet for dinner on Friday the 2nd.  There are lots of resturants around Columbia and if you think it is better I can just call you on the morning of the 2nd after graduation and we can decide (if Kristi has a preference) and meet around 5 or so?I know you told me it was at least a 4 hour drive so didn't know exactly what we wanted to do.  We may go to the zoo that day after her graduation and not sure what else.  Just thought I drop you a line since I seem not to log on when you are here sometimes.  Just let me know and we will go from there.Luna"
