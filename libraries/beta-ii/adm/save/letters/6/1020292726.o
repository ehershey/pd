__Letter "I have been working on my area...  All that i have done so far is at my house on my computer.  I should be able to transfer all that can fit to a disk this weekend.  As for as the guild commands go i thought they all have been fixed.  I guess i was wrong...I havent worked on typos or any of the sort since you told me not to because that was now Daos's job.  Im very glad to be here still and it is a privilage.  Thanks Stormbringer for understanding :)Whit"
