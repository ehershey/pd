__Letter "There should be an extension to the graveyard a few north and all west where the kataans and necros halls are, a secret underground maze (a graveyard) with undead i believe it should be almost like sewers 'cept four levels In turn this should TREMENDOUSLY be helpful to clerics/paladins or whoever else has turn since skills-wise early on they need a way to get xp and xp is often quite slow with each of the four levels the first level will be for lvls 1 - 5 filled with 400k - 5k mobs the second level with 6k - 15k mobs and the third lvl with 17k - 28k and the fourth with 30k - 45k mobs  The mobs will of course be undead perhaps with each level a lil bit of newbie armour on the lil wee wee mobs but just weapons on the bigger ones (the big mobs should have something that only one drops once in a while) and it should be a weapon that there is not an abundance of in the game perhaps a projectile and/or flail/blunts because I believe there are few of them out there and the ones out there autoload at either a high lvl and gets hard for those trying to get up there and maybe this weapon could perhaps be a slight rare drop on some of the mobs on the fourth level or be hidden in some kind of secret room other than that  idk the theme should be the living undead tho and it should be a scary lil passageway with the only exit out is until you clear out the mobs or something >:) and no teleporting and things of the such - my 2 cents- Holy Knight Warrick"
