__Letter "What do you say to including the old ogre caves in the new event?Amun was talking about something where you have to collect the portal fragments. We could have each exit portal start out as unspawned, and have to assemble them with portal fragments that you find scattered throughout the area. The last portal fragments in the last cave could then be something to assemble a portal to the new ogre caves. That would allow the old caves to open again along with the new caves.If you do decide to do it that way, we should probably have it check a denyPortalEntrance variable, instead of a canEnterPortal variable. That way, the portals will only have to be assembled once, when the event is started, and after that they will always be up."
