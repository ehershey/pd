__Letter "If you dont mind, id like to get this balance thing out of the way. I know itsnone of my buisness, but I think I might be able to help you out with it. Ivegot a few questions and suggestions to ask and present.1. Are you using a base(controll) subject, like a lvl 30(class: whatever,subclass:whatever) with 50's or 60's across the board for its stats.2. going out and testing that characters spells/attacks with maxxed skillsand then balancing from there?doing it like this might be an easier, though a little time consuming, thing."
