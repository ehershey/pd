__Letter "WE really need a link to the builders site off the website. I would suggest limiting the login from the website to existing builders only. Don't let someone create a character via the website on builders. You supply the link and give me the ISP for the website and i'll alter the login.c to screen out the website people.I would set it up to allow only builders to log into the site in this manner. I just need you to supply the link and give me the ISP to test for.You also need to set up Cortoth on the website as a builder.Ironman"
