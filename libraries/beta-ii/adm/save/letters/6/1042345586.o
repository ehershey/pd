__Letter "Well, it seems my brother won't be going to sleep as early as i thought he would. He's got a raid going with his guild on Everquest. And those usually take a while. He says he'll be going to sleep by midnight (my time) but knowing how raids go, there's a high possibility it will be later. But I should be able to stay up for hours upon hours tonight. It just may be that we have to wait a little bit to have the wedding (if we can have it tonight). Can't wait to see you again. ;)Savannah"
