__Letter "If you're interested in looking, it would be somewhere within the guild filesystem, wherever the ethereal items are located...probably \"dew.c\". Otherwise, I do have it on the builders port, I am pretty sure it's /wizards/kumi/areas/ethereal/objects/dew.c or somewhere in /wizards/kumi anyway...I honestly have no complaints as far as any of the non-fantasy things on PD go. If people want to have a kwik-e-mart, plushy dolls, french fries, and bloody marys, that's none of my business. The only things that would ever bother me, is if something added were bugged, or harmed anyone in the game (to a certain extent...). Anyway, as I said, the dew itself may seem like the soda, but it is actually meant to be dew from the mountain. If you want to take a look at the file, go ahead, and if you want me to change it at all, you know you're welcome to tell me to, and I will. I'm not interested in having fights, or making anyone unhappy here, that includes you, so...Also, Evolution (a real life friend, whom I brought to this mud), and I are working on areas together, and we'd like to know if we could have a shared directory, or access to eachother's directories on the builder's port. It would help us write everything a little more quickly, and it's just a bit more efficient to have a shared directory between the two of us, if we're going to be working on this together. As it is, we're just having to share code with eachother and wait until it gets added in....Let me know if you're able to do this, if you need Evolution's approval first, I'll just have him send you a mudmail with his permission or something along those lines. I'd really appreciate this. I think our first area might be a little small, but it's coming along nicely.Take Care,Jen"
