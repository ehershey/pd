__Letter "UNIX administrators will find many similarities between PowerShell and the tools thatthey are familiar with. In fact, many of the individuals who were involved with developingPowerShell have extensive knowledge of UNIX, AS400, and VMS. The level of interactivityin PowerShell was inspired by BASH and KSH.

The production orientation was modeled afterthe CS on the AS400 and the DCL on VMS.heh cut and paste from the ebook im reading. no wonder its so much like *nix"
