__Letter "I have set up an LP mud running off the Dead Souls mudlib.  Just to give a bit of history, Nightmare which PD is using was the precursor to Dead Souls.  I would like to get some Wizards to help develop the realm.  The one feature that I found particularly nice was the QCS (Quick Creation System), so that you don't have to be in an editor typing out lines of code to create rooms, monsters, armour, etc.  You could just do create room n for instance, and it would write out the code for you in the file. You might wonder about the name of the mud, but it's just temporary for now until I come up with something.  If this sounds like something you are interested in, please drop by the mud at dreamscape.murpe.com 7001.  I think we all can agree that PD was good while it lasted, but now it's time for a change.  Daos - Creator of DSMud"
