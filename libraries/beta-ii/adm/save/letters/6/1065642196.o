__Letter "Hey there, I'm so sorry that I didn't say anything to you after a while... I fell asleep, and when I woke up, it was 7:30 my time, and thats when I remebered I was still on PD... except it didn't lastvery long apparently since the internet kicked me out! But I just wanted to tell you thank you forletting me vent to you about my problems. The things you said, I didn't imagine that anyone lookingfrom the outside in would actually say those statements, its encouraging! But, I don't want to setmyself up again to have my heart broken, however... you can't live without taking risks right!No, I won't give up, yes, I'll continue to be his friend, and we'll just see what happens right...you know, you're pretty smart for a 16, will be 17 year old at the end of this year:) Well, I hopeyou passed you IT exam... I gotta study for my exam.... but thank you for the advise, I totallyappreciate it! See you in PD later on....the Frog!\""
