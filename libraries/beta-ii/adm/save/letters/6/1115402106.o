__Letter "Well, it seems my brain isn't quite up to par.  I found a note to myself that said I was suppose to mudmail Chris my new number.  I'm so good with notes but unfortunately I keep misplacing them.  So, I mudmailed him yesterday and he called me last night.  I was alseep but there was a message.  So now I write bigger notes on sticky paper and leave them all over :PIllisse the forgetful mage"
