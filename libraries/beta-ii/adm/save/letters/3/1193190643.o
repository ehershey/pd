__Letter "Hey love, I was ironing out some union stuff for my co-workers so theycould see what we are going to try to get out of this contract. I wishI was in this screen long enough to say hi to you, but I guess I willuse this opportunity to miss you even more. Then, I'll be all the morerelieved when I get a chance to speak to you. :) How's that for a silver lining? :) Take care and kill well. :)Love you too,Escxxxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxxoxoxoxoxooxoxoooxoxoxoxoxo :)"
