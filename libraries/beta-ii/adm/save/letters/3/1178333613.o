__Letter "You look over the male centaur.Eios Kendt's eyes glow a bright white, almost blinding, you get a small glimpseand they seem wolven like, calm yet interesting. He is about 2 and half meterstall with a neatly trimmed goatee, his body built like a brick. You notice manybattle scares from past brawls. On his chest a tattoo with the words 'bestia absnatura' written around the face of Gaia and on his left shoulder a tattoo of awolf. Just from looking at him you can tell that there is more to him then whatyou see... Nature seems to flow around him as if it where an aura. A glimpse ofsomething hanging out of his Black Diamond looks foreign and gives you theimpression that he has been to many places and seen many things. The fresh smellof forest herbs also grabs your attention, a wierd but nice calming smell. Hestands proud with two Starscreams sheathed seperatly on his shoulders. He is aconfident man who is known to take on anything or anyone that gets in his way ofdoing such he pleases.Eios is married to Sugarcandy.An aura of holiness surrounds him.Eios has a burn mark the shape of a circlet across his forehead and temples. An inscription in the burn reads: Annar TilinHe is in top shape.He is wearing:Master Ring (worn)Eios's wedding ring (worn)Master Ring (worn)Master Ring (worn)Master Ring (worn)Master Ring (worn)skull ring (worn)skull ring (worn)Master Ring (worn)tail ties (worn)PK Badge of Coolness (worn)straight jacket (worn)sapphire earrings (worn)Wolfskin Cloak (worn)Mage Robes (worn)Holy shield (worn)a leopard skin loincloth (worn)A chainmail blanket (worn)Sash of Forsaken (worn)Bride's Maid Dress (worn)A Boonga!
