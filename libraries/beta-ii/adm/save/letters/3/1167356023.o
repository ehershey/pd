__Letter "I want you to come look over the new system guys. Either Whit or Stormbringer. I think i've been pretty thru with it but Amun wantsme to change a few things. I therefore want an Administrativereview of the protocals i put in place.If you like them, I'll leave them in place. If you want a change,I'll do them as you specify.Yes i have added more locks and altered older ones. The builderscontrol the KEYS to those locks. They just need to master how touse them.Ironman"
