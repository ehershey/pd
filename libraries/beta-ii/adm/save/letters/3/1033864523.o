__Letter "whew, it took me so long to fall asleep, then when I finally woke up it was 2:30.  That's cool about your sister, how about we meet up on Monday afternoon.  As long as we get the first pathway ideas undway, I can do that while you are gone for the week.  Think of a way to hide the crystal dragon within the pathway, and which color dragon you want along side of the path, oh! and if we were going to hide the orbs in the four pathways, maybe two to three different ways of hiding an orb.  Like I said the other night, once I learn how to do these different things, the other paths will be quite easyDid we want the dragons to come alive when the orbs were placed?  or just the last dragon?  we'll talk about this on Monday (hopefully)  I belive I get off at 11 am, which is 4 your time, but it takes roughly 30 mins to get home, (depends on traffic).  Let me know if this is a good time for you or, if you have better.  just mudmail me, I don't think I can get on for long periods of time tomorrow (Sunday)  we are picking up our mattress and going to walmart, then hubby would prolly hog the comp when we get home :P"
