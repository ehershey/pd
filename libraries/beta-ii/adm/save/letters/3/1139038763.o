__Letter "Wizard:Level 5:tremble:3 to kill a 106 exp mob5 to kill a 586 exp mob5 to kill a 848 exp mob8 to kill a 3.6k exp mobmagic missile:3 to kill a 106 exp mob7 to kill a 1207 exp mob4 to kill a 357 exp mob13 to kill a 3.6k exp mobsummary: The first level was a bit of a challenge, it took over 50 rounds of missile to kill a 800 exp monster, with that exp i leveled and the time it took was cut down to about 30 after maxing skills, at level 3 i got tremble, which took appoxamately 10 or so rounds to kill a 1k monster, i used this to get to level 5, maxed skills and the results above were the end result of the first 5 levels. money is hard to come by, i spent most of my time exping in the elven village to the north.i luckily found some stones in the pit so i have been okay for the time being. mana costs are seeming to be around 2-5 mp a cast.level 10:tremble:4 to kill a 5.5k mob5 to kill a 8.1k mob7 to kill a 11k mob6 to kill a 9.6k mobmagic missile:5 to kill a 5.5k mob6-7 to kill a 8.1k mob8-9 to kill a 11k mob7 to kill a 9.6k mobshockwave:6 to kill a 9.6k mob4 to kill a 5.5k mob5 to kill a 8.1k mob6 to kill a 11k mobsummary: all monsters 3-4k and below are all easily 1-2 rounded with all above spells. i obtained shockwave as i leveled from 5 to 10, climbing up the levels was a slight challenge, i took on the 11k townspeople in roston, taking about 20 rounds apiece with tremble, soon as i reached level 10, i maxed my skills to result in the above information, skills help out alot, shockwave has been a good addition, as it started out much stronger than tremble without the skills. money is a little easier to come by as i can easily kill monsters in elven village. mana costs are seeming around 8-10 mp a cast.level 15:Fog:Well its not a direct damage spell so i'm going to approach this a little differently,using fog alone, i can kill a 3k monster with 6 rounds of fog and my weak idles. When used against stronger mobs and using shockwave, anything 15k+ has a round knocked off of it in killing time. It is a very helpful dot spell that adds fun to exping!magic missile:3 for a 5.6k mob5-6 for a 11k mob8-9 for a 17k mob13 for a 25k mobtremble:3 for a 5.6k mob4 for a 11k mob6-7 for a 17k mob9 for a 25k mobshockwave:2 for a 5.6k mob4 for a 11k mob5 for a 17k mob7 for a 25k mobsummary: i am now starting to feel powerful. exping is much faster and i am starting ot get the hang of using fog and shockwave toghter, i learned fog and coalesce from leveling to 15. mana costs are starting to finally climb 20-25 mp for missile/tremble/shockwave and around 30ish for fog. i take quite a bit of damage due to a lack of a buff spell that lasts more than 5 rounds, but it is completly understandable for my level. off to 20 i go now!level 20:magic missile:4 rounds for a 10k mob7 rounds for a 11k mob9 rounds for a 15k mob13 rounds for a 25k mobtremble:2 rounds for a 10k mob4 rounds for a 11k mob5 rounds for a 15k mob7 rounds for a 25k mobshockwave:2 rounds for a 10k mob3 rounds for a 11k mob3 rounds for a 15k mob5 rounds for a 25k mobpillar:3 rounds for a 10k mob5 rounds for a 11k mob5 rounds for a 15k mob7 rounds for a 25k mobsummary: Exping is going along smoothly. fog and shockwave continue to be a nice combo, at level 20 i obtained pillar. Which happens to not be a powerful as tremble or shockwave currently. maybe that will change as time and skills progress, but for now it is my 3rd strongest attack spell out of 4. I have yet to mention guard until now as it has either always seemed to fail or add little to nothing protection, while lasting 4-5 rounds. this currently stands, it still only lasts 4-5 rounds, but offers enough protection to want to use in bigger battles to keep safer. I still take quite a bit of damage but seeing as how im a single target mage it is easy to keep healed, also the option of obtaining good equipment is still there. i finally have slightl issues with mana. as fog takes 35-40 and shockwaves take a consistant 25, the other three slightly less around 20. after 5-10 mobs depending on the workingness of my stones, i have to stop for a 2-4 round breather for mana. class seems to be very well thought out and has the outlook of it staying the same. stay tuned for part 5... level 25!"
