__Letter "I had a dream about you last night, just a nice dream :).  Please clean up the board, and can it be made so i can do it?  As for the news, i just want the stuff there removed because it says something about us joined with Darksouls and we aren't anymore but no one could tell me how to change it.How are things with you?  We don't get to talk much anymore, but it's good that you are busy, working and stuff, i miss you sometimes.It's great PD is back up and thank you for everything you do, i know i'm not the only one who appreciates your efforts, even if sometimes it doesn't seem that way.We are all good here, though now winter is creeping in it's getting cold brrrrrr.  Courtney is doing well at school, and i'm still arguing with Ash about getting a job but i'm hoping it's just his age.Anyway gotta bolt, write again later*snugs*Anne"
