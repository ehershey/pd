__Letter "//CAUTION = It's Frickin Long :P I was not easy on them in things I thought were wrong.Mk, well, i took a look into the ethereal guild dir, and this is what i seen...The ethereal pray room is identical to couch that Illuminati have. You rest (i forget the command) and it restores your sp, mp and hp back to max. Since Illuminati have these couches in their sub-halls all over the mud except in places they were not allowed to have them, then I think it's fair to say that this prayer room of Ethereal's is a bit fair.Their trinity belt has a Mass of 3 and an AC of 3. while this may seem fair enough, it isn't really because the one of the popular MUD eq is a skull belt, weighing 15 mass and having an AC of3. I'd recommend the trinity mass be moved up to at least 10. I know guild eq is special for a reason, but this is a bit cheaty.The cloud boots don't have a value OR a mass. Thats just stupid.The sapphire bracelet has an AC of 3 and a mass of 1. which means a stone of sapphire protects you more than it weighs. Items in this fantasy game should conform to Some Form of logic, and i don't think any bracelet could give you 3 times protection than it weighs.now, the infamous eidolon blade everyone's having a problem with now that holy swords from Illuminati are fixed :P.-->they weigh 20, yet have a WC of 13...a weapon that does a lot of damage, and can be wielded in One Hand...only costs 100-135 gold...has a 1/5 chance to special, which is high considering all the mud was complaining when a certain guild's specialing sword was around that high...I noticed in my search for conformity amoung other guilds that forsaken and AoD also have swords that have a 1/5 chance to special, but lower AC (forsaken = AC 12, AoD = AC 11[11 being better than 12, as 12 is still cheaty])The etheral's mask has a AC of 5...the rare and sought after Blood Mask, which is no longer found because the mob that had it was removed, only has an AC of 3. Lodos mask on the angel has AC of 3, the Merkkirri mask, which would be dangerous to get, only has an AC of 2...5 is just purely ridiculous, especially when it only weighs 1. Merkkirri mask weighs 4, blood mask weighs 2 and lodos mask weighs 3...so the Ethereal mask, which is worth 2 gold, gives its wearer 5 times the protection of its weight....Their frozen staff has a WC of 9, it should weigh more than 5, even if it Was Made by an Ice Mage because it is a full length staff, so it should also have to be wielded in two hands, not one. if its a short staff its description should say frozen short staff, not frozen staff.They have a tailwrap...wasn't there a ruiling that there was to be no tail or horn armour in guilds? which is why its so rare? I can't say much about its AC, except its one more than that for the lodos tail ties, because tail and horn armour is rare...Frosted Wings are also purely ridiculous. They weigh 1 to its wearer, and yet gives them an Armour Class of 7 when worn. You can wear them, and then fly, which means that the wearer has constant protection from them. Wing Flames from AoD only have an AC of 4, weigh 8 (double the weight of their protection), and also paralyze when you wear and remove them. This means you cannot fly with them on, and in order to fly while wearing them, you must first remove the wingmail, which means before you fly, you are paralyzed. Forsaken and Illuminati also have wingmail, but they only have an AC of 1, which enables them to wear them while flying, while landing and at all times, but 1 AC is Nothing compared to AC 7 with a weight of only 1.Looking at other files in the Ethereal Dir, i noticed that they have a portal not in function yet to places OFF the Main Island, which i was told is Strickly Forbidden for Guilds. Illuminati was Forbidden to have them. Not only this, in that ethereal has access to merkkirri, Rhondale, and Purgatory, but they get their access portals from the Forsaken Dir. Then I noticed Forsaken have access, through their flaming portal, to purgatory and rhondale.Everything in Ethereal I haven't mentioned i haven't mentioned because i think they're okay. The sacks, the tunic, the beans and the dew are fine in the sense they are not overpowered. However, having guild mobs such as homer simpson and strongbad are Far From being Fantasy Genre Related, and Neither is Mountain Dew. I would appeal that they be requested to have a name change as it does not fit in the genre of this Entire Mud, which is mythical fantasy."
