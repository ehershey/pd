__Letter "Hey Beautiful, how are you doing? I'm alright, it's 11:05 my time and I'm thinking that I will be out of school tomorrow, but I dunno....I hope I will be though. I miss you so much already it's not even funny, but I'll live on, knowing that I will for sure be able to talk to you sometime again makes it all worth while. I know I said I was going to send you the enchanting, romantic snow scene but I really REALLY wanna tell you that over the phone. But if you really want to know it now/soon just send me a mail back telling me and then I'll just mail it to you, but remember I really want to do it over the phone so taht way I can hear your cute little sigh, knowing that it was really romantic and so forth. I love you so much Beautiful and I can't wait to talk to you again. *hugs and kisses*(p.s. I hope your day goes well tomorrow too beautiful! *hugs and kisses again* I love you with all of my heart :) )"
