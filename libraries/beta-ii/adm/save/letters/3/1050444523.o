__Letter "*Gasp* I have had a revelation about our trip to Panama City Beach. I have the answer to all our questions! Where do we meet? Not the pool. Not kayaking. Not on a bus. But on the elevator!!!!I can't believe i never thought of it before. It's so simple. But the only way *that* works is if you are staying in the same hotel as i am.Anyway, just had to tell you that right quick before i forgot about it. And doing email would take too long for such a short message.Love you,Heather"
