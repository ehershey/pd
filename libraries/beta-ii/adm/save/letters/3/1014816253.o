__Letter "Here's what I posted on stormy's board...  just thought you might be interested.Well, now there's tons of people planning on killing all the dragons when they get the chance.  It's getting incredibly frustrating.  It seems that the majority of our players are bad.  Just straight up, rotten players.  I was hoping for a while that eventually more good ones would come into the mud and kinda drown the bad ones out, but it seems the opposite is happening.  The bad players are making this a terrible place to play and are scaring away the good players.  Tonight I got VERY close to going on a desting spree of the rotten players then just ciding.  I'm still somewhat close.  I've put a bit of work into here, and I dont want to lose it, but if this continues, I may not even care about that.  I'm here not because I want to have fun (I do enjoy coding, though) but because I want to be a part of something successful.  Right now, it's not looking good for this mud, despite the awesome ideas and coding that's gone into it.  It's the players that are destroying it before anything of quality can be enjoyed.  When law is opened, there's either going to be a lot of desting, or a lot of good players leaving.  Then the bad ones will kill themselves off or get bored.  by that time, this place will be a ghost town worse than it was in phase 1.  I dont like that.  At all.  If this mud is just going to die, I'd rather invest my time in something a little more worth while.Well...  that's about it.  I just figured I'd share *smooch*  hope you slept well tonight :)  *hugs*                            -Nightshade"
