Didnt wanna take the time toget gmud going. Class is going good, understanding the conceptswell (heredity and evolution) and I will be having my debate withmy group in 3 weeks. That should be enuff time ta whip em inta shape. ;)Thinking of you, obviously. :D I hope you have and had a good day.Love,James"
