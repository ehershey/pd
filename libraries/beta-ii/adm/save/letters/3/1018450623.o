__Letter "Husband and wife lying in bed and husband starts to feel a little frisky. He starts kissing his wife and rubbing her but she stops him and says \"Not tonite hon, I have a gynocologist apointment in the morning, i wanna stay fresh\". So disapointed the husband rolls over and after a little, rolls back to look at his wife and whispers in her ear \"So, do you have a dentist apointment too?\""
