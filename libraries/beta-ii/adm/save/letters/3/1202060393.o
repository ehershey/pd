__Letter "I'm trying to create a new command for my use on builders.I need to know how to handle one thing tho.i want the command to be able to read the /adm/save/users dir.Reason is i want to make a command that can inventory the filesfor daos and me. I want to create a way to keep track of whoselogged in and when without having to finger each and every oneindividually. Basically a summary report of the user files.I know i can handle creating the command. I just need to knowhow to make the command have read access to the directory.Please mail me back with directions and i can handle it fromthere.Ironman"
