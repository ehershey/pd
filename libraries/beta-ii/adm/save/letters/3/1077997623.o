__Letter "Alright, here's where I'm coming from.  I'm sorry if the \"get over it\" seemed a bit harsh.  I had said that in confidence to Daos who obviously didnt realize it.  The reason why I do nothing is this:  If something happens here on the mud that would cause someone to be dested, I have to have proof of it.  This is a personal rule I've established from previous experience of being an admin.  Without proof, there are just as many people hurt than when some people get away with it.  I would like to err on the side of letting more people play.  That is why I would like a log of somesort.  Other people can log it too if they can see it(says, emotes, etc).  I do want the mud to be fun for everyone, but you must remember that I want to make it fun for EVERYONE, so I try to stick to needing proof.  I'm sorry that Helena has been upset by things that go on here on the mud.  If emotes still show through ignore, I will try to fix that as soon as I send this mudmail.  One other thing about the get over it comment.  I wont say that I didnt say it, but all I was told is that someone \"called her fat\" and that was it.  There wasnt anything else described.  I dont think you would want me to dest someone for that, even if it is mean.                                  -NightshadePS I will send a copy of this to Azire as well, since you decided to include her with your first mail."
