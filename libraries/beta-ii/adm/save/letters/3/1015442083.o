__Letter "Hey Storm, I need to have some kind of conference with you and wiz and the other Imm's about mages and our spells.  Some things just aren't working the way they should and other things really aren't fair the way they've been changed.  This can wait until you all have time, but I do think it is important, there are many new mages and they will be reaching my lvl and skills in the next coming month.  They will start complaining and I know you hate that.  One of the main issues is how no matter how high our magic defense is, magic defense spells don't seem to be affected by our skills.  When I have to pay close to 10mil for one point of defense, when defense is at 21, I need a reliable magic defense spell.  That's just one of the issues but the main one of concern at the moment.  Please mail me when a talk about this stuff would be at your convinience.Soulfly"
