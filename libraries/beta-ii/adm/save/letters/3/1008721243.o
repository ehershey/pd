__Letter "I would just like to add this.  Just because i got the msdos version doesnt mean i will steal the code.  All i got it was for to work offline on building and get out all my errors before i upload them so i dont sit here for an hour trying to make it work and getting in trouble for being on the net.  That was my purpose.  I still plan to contribute loyaly to Primal Darkness and i hope someday to become an admin"
