__Letter "To my dearest Queen Empyrean.Today I hunted with slendor. I regained the health I lost from days past and many fell, it was quite energizing. I went back to that island but a shadow attacked me and I had to make haste as I was clinging to my last breathe and retreated in time.I was also back at the castle where it seems they always have a wedding going on. Those Tenebraians go figure. One of the guards tried to get rough with me and I took him to the task but he called for reinforcments and they had me in a negative life energy, BUT the gods spared me and I was able to regain some of my negative health before the reaper could claim me.All and all it was an exciting day. I must continue to work on my magical abilities to be able to protect my Queen in the event of the dangers they may try to befall her.Be well my Queen.Jynteral"
