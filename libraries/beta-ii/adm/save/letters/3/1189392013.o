I will NOT do it      for you. I will however walk you thru coding it      for yourself. The sole exception is if i feel it      is something vital to your area's theme and is      beyond what your coding skills can manage at this      time.--More-- (74%)I'm normally around daily from 9a to noon monday to friday EST.I'm almost always on all day on sundays.
