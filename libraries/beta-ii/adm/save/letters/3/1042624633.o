__Letter "PD-Builders is back up, would you give me a quick message saying what is still in the way of the area coming in? Is there anything I can do to speed it up? (Like sending you the whole thing in .c documents if PD ftp is up but builders ftp is down etc)Sorry to be nagging you a bit, just we've been waiting on a new exp ground for a few months now. If only the FTP had been up before we could've had it now :/That's all.c'ya. - Prator"
