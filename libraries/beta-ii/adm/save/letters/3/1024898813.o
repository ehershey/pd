__Letter "I checked the room you were in as Ku and it is not bugged. Nothing there is broken. I resent the fact that you would think I would dump you out of the quest or try to trick you out of it. I could care less how many dragons there are and hope everyone who wants one gets one, it is why we left that second part of the quest the same.Stormy"
