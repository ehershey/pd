__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Wisp to Stormbringer Sun Mar 23 17:25:41 2003:-----Ok, i'm having this problem with tells, i know that Gob has had the same problem.  They will work for a while, then suddenly stop working and then work again.  They still come up on your last tell list, but i've notice the ones that don't show up look different to the ones that do.Aard replies: God I hate figuring time differencesAard replies: lolYou reply to Aard: just add 3 hours and turn it into the opposite time ofday....i think it's 3 hrsThe previous tells showed up where as the next ones didn't -Aard tells you:n/mLeviathas tells you:!Notice how the ones that don't show up don't have a space between the : and the words, i don't know if that is the problem or it is my problem, but i'm tired of getting yelled at for ignoring people *wink*Sabbabe Cabbage WispStormy"
