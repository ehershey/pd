__Letter "Message 39 by Rohl: \"Animal Companion\"=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=Alright here's my idea for Druids. Possibly rangers too but that doesn't belonghere. I believe druids should gain the support of an animal companion. Perhapswhen you achieve level 20, or even when you start your character, you can pickone of 3 various stones out of the druid hall. Each stone would represent ananimal companion, your new pet. Perhaps a bear, panther, and wolf? The stonewould then be an item in your inventory that cannot be lost. You could \"call'companion' and bring your companion by your side. Your companion would startat level 1, and would get stronger as it fights. Maybe it would automaticallyaid you in battle too, but i definately think it shouldn't be labeld as amonster in the room because I have that problem as kataan with my summons, ihave to type kill monster 2 and so on.I just think druids deserve something like this, something more to work withthan supporting others with buffs. thanks for your time"
