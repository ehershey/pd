__Letter "I'm trying to make sure the guide dragon's follow works...a couple of things...I removed the check for is_linkdead, because it always seems to return 1. Also, apparently, doing set_following(0) doesn't actually stop you from following them, it just removes them from your following list. You still end up following them if they happen to walk by you.That doesn't matter anymore though, because I changed the way follow works. If at any point, you want the dragon to stop following them, make sure to do: retreatLoc = 0;Otherwise, when the dragon finds they are no longer following a player, they will retreat to that location set."
