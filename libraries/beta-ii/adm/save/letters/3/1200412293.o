__Letter "#1 is something I've already planned to do, but using the directoryas a zone default. I do not think it a good idea to allow people tomake safe rooms nonsafe though.#2 is definitely possible, but I'm not sure if it would save memorygiven how many large mappings we'd have loaded. You could try itout I suppose, but one issue I can think of is that many objectsstore info in variables and don't autoload, so you have no way ofgetting that info when you recreate the object. Oils and stonesare like this."
