__Letter "He asked me for a builders character the other day,  And I gave him one.  Well, turns out, some players told me that he is Cenn.  There is only one reason why he hasnt been rid yet.  He actually seems to be building an area.  Hes been asking alot of questions and such.  So, it is up to you what you wanna do, but, since you can no longer mess up people with call on builders, I dont think he would be much of a problem, and if he gives us an area, it would be nice.Whit"
