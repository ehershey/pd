__Letter "Well, this is a level 1 scout, but I'd be happy to help test stuff.I can get to level 5 rather quickly but if you need like level 20,well, good luck ;-)By the way, I have an idea for a scout abil: a leap attack from anadjacent room (HAS to be used from adjacent room), that works sort oflike backstab but you can use it bare handed too...Anyway yeah... thanks for actually helping the classesthat need help."
