__Letter "I finally got home tonight, but it seems I'm a little too late.  I saw what you mentioned on the cre line...  did you get accepted at the art institute?  That'd be great if you did.  Well, I guess I'll just have to wait til tomorrow to see ya.                             -Paulbtw...   sorry if I seem kinda over-needy...  I guess I just miss you a lot and find myself thinking about you all the time.  *hugs*  I'll see you when I see you ;)"
