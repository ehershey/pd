__Letter "Hey Beautiful, thank you so much for the Valentine's card, it was so cute. :) I miss you lots and I wish I could be there to celebrate Valentine's Day with you. But none the less I'm hoping you are having a great Valentine's Day so far as well. I know I haven't said it but I'm wanting you to be my Valentine. :). I love you so much and I hope I get to talk to you soon, even if it's on here or on the phone. Have a good day at school, Beautiful. I love you so much Simran *hugs and kisses*Yours Forever and Always,Joshie :)"
