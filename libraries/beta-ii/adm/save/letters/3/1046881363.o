__Letter "Rebalancing had nothing to do with anyone complaining. I did just as I said I was going to do. These are the things that have needed doing for awhile now.As for Rubicante, wtf does it matter what his playing time is? The reason for this is a bug I encountered whne moving him back to player, his character had to be deleted and then redone, he lost all eq, money he was carrying, aliases, etc. So he paid a high price for the time reset.As far as I know, which I have logs to back me up on most things, no one on the staff is handing out score info to other players. Yes there are ways to get around the lobs but I am not sure anyone knows how. The only imm that was a part of the guilds you mentioned is Hermes and he has agreed, when he was made imm, that he has no guild ties left. If you have proof of him cheating you should mail it to me, otherwise leave it be.And the reason you are not playing anymore is because you are no longer able to do super damage at no cost, it is the truth and you know it. Far as Prator goes, I could care less. He had a set of moves he cheated with, never reported them, and got to almost legend status with before I got to change them. By all rights, I should have deleted him from the mud several times for bug abuse.So, I think if you want to act like an ass, maybe you should go play elswhere. Your posts are irratating and I do not appriciate your fucking attitude. Do not bother me with this again, else you will find yourself gone.Stormy"
