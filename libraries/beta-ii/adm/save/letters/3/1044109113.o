__Letter "For instance, Pixie dragons would probably be the size of a human child. Butterfly wings, they would have high int and high wisdom, and would be primarily spell casters. There would be \"Marsh\" dragons; they are more snakelike in nature, with no arms or wings, but they are also the strongest (Being pretty much a living muscle as snakes are). They tend to closely resemble Oriental dragons, but are a high gloss black in colour. The Gryphon is actually another type of dragon; feathers, a head which vaguely resembes a hawk, with the rear of the creature scaleless and rather feline looking. They are the closest, game wise, to our current dragons. Then, there are also Wraiths, or Shadow dragons, which are not actually dragons at all; they are living shadows, but when light is shined upon them they appear vaguely dragon-like, giving life to the rumor that they are the spirit of an evil dragon of old. Pheonix is, like the Gryphon, simply another kind of dragon; constantly bathed in magical flames. They excel at melee combat, not for their strength but for their extremely high dexterity and naturally burning state. The last dragon is the \"Familiar\". This dragon has the ability to take any body shape they so desire, with their natural body being extremely weak and frail. Despite this, they are highly intelligent and charismatic, being gifted with the ability to talk themselves out of any sitatuation."
