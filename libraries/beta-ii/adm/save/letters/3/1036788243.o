There are some who just do it for the exhileration rush.  For others, they need to work out guild matters, or player differences, and this is one way to do that.  A slight few kill just to prove it can be done, then they can tell the rest of the world.On to the arena, it's there for players who want to battle each other.  You don't get to loot a corpse, no loss of levels, so what's the point?  If you're going after someone, the idea is to make them hurt as much as possible.  The best way is outside of the arena."
