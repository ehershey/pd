__Letter "The Poison Ivy of the Great Acirian Forest is a very potent natural defense against outsiders.  The inhabitants of Kesis have a natural defense against it from being exposed to the island's atmosphere.  However, there is a strong chance that an outsider to the island may be afflicted by it during their exploration.How they get it:Each room should have a random chance of them being afflicted by the Poison Ivy.  The chance should be something pretty rare, but make it likely that walking 100 rooms or so will get them.  They don't know that they have it until symptoms occur, but maybe it could change their description to say that they have a horrible rash on a random limb.Effects:The Poison Ivy will give messages now and again that the player is very itchy.  For a round during the itch, they have to stop to scratch--it is mind numbingly itchy.  They can't use any abilities or spells or the like while they itch.  The more time passes, the Poison Ivy's timer gets smaller and smaller, so this happens more often.  It would get really annoying.The cure:an item called 'antidote alpha' which can be purchased in a store on Kesis.  Have it keyed to the item ID of the Poison Ivy, and remove it.I understand if this is too much code to ask.  Just let me know.  Thanks man =)Levi"
