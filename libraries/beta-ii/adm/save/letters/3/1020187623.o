__Letter "I killed calirynth last night while protecting stryder while he was in jail. I dont know if cali knew that combat dosent end after a death with something, but he walked in there while stryder was bound and gagged. I backstabbed him not knowing that he wanted to talk to stryder. I had a long talk with him about it afterwards, explaining what happened and all that other stuff, and a few other players as well. I dont know if that was the cause of him leaving builders (I liked kaknal personally) and if it was, then im sorry"
