__Letter "I was sitting here doing some thinking while idleing and as to not forget to tell you when I see you next, I decided mud-mail was the next best thing to trying to keep it in my head.There may be a problem with the crystal amulet, and it goes as such...If a berserker is raging, and they die, then come back to life via the amulet, they still have the rage object on them... so they keep raging. Only problem is, there is now both death, and a super OOBER angel in the room with you... which you will auto-attack. If you attack said angel, you're gonna die. Alot. And you can't run because you are raging. So, that might be a bug you might wanna have whoever made the thing check out. Maybe forward this mail or something. Later.Cookie"
