__Letter "Well since Lucifer doesn't play anymore I would like to request that Me and Lac who are also both Leaders of the Forsaken guild to have as much power as he does. Atm we can't use the /change/ command and also we probably can't use the /newsadd/ command, so if you could give me and Lac equal power that would be great.  --Kai."
