__Letter "Ok this is what happened to me... i was xping cloaked in tenebrae and rhuan comes in and kills me for no reason.. like 5 minutes before that Vyce was 25min idle.. now if that isnt multi playing then i dont know what is.. He would have had to of seen me on vyce and loged in an alt to kill me this is just stupid because if you let him kill people like your going to have no players left on the mud. Also he killed my alt Alchemon not long ago and claims he didnt know it was me yeh well he can keep pulling himself because everyone knows scamp is alchemon.. i have been around for a long time and im sure everyone knows who i am."
