__Letter "There was a motion from several of the players to have the Mad Cow Inn in Dystopia put back into the MUD. I'm aware it has bugs and typos, but I'm offering to fix it up and have it readded, if given permission and the code to work from and such. Speaking of code, I have a new miniarea to be added into the MUD as soon as one little problem about it is fixed."
