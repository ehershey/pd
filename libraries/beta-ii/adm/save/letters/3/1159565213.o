__Letter "Ok, so playing up to 34 so far I gotta say I really like the class.. but there's a few things I think would help make them a little better without making them overpoweredFirst i'm sure as you  know when you knock someone down with clobber, you cant clobber them again until they stand up.. normally I would just use smash at this point (honestly, jab and headbutt are completely useless once you get clobber) but there's really a small amount of rooms that you can actually use smash in. There's 2 ways to fix thisA) The boring way, fix it so no matter what you can find something to smash on (which wouldnt always make sense IE: helgrath snow plainsb) The really cool super-fun way :P Implement an ability called \"stomp\" this ability would only be able to be used when an opponent is (laying) I would say pretty much cloning smash as far as damage, pre-requisites and what it's based off of (attk,str,dex, etc) smash is considerably weaker than a good clobber so I dont think it would give us an unfair advantagemy favorite part about thugs are the fact that you can get different attacks via clobber and smash is one of the few abilities out of all the classes that's actually worth using aside from your *main* abil (kinda like why cut when you can slash) I'm not sure how you guys feel about giving subs lots of abilities but I think stomp would be a great idea and would make my exping a lot more fun, because it is frustrating just sitting there for a round over and over (headbutt and jab do less damage than my idles)Personally I'd like to be able to use it the instant they're knocked down, sure it would allow us to use two abilities in one round on occasion, but it would require you also to be a little quicker on the draw with entering commands. but even if you had to wait for that lag round to come it would be nice to be able to stomp a mudhole in your foe :P"
