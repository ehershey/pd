__Letter "Hi.....I know I shouldn't be thinking about this....but I don't think I should be in this game anymoreand its not you.....I promise....its me. I'm not good enough to be in the game, and I don't think I can compete with any other player. All of you are good....and there's no way I'm going to be at anyones level any time soon. I still don'teven understand this game or how its supposed to be played....I don't know if I should stay on all night or just kill thingsoff. I really want to be the top player....which would be your leader in the guild....just to prove it to him andeveryone else that he's not the only one thats good. As much as I want to, I can't be good....theres no way I can,so.....maybe its better I just leave the game for a while or something. Im just really confused and I feel stupid anyways.....yes...your wife has a self esteem problem......but I can't help it....I just feel like Im not good for anyone..thats all.I know you wanted to see me today or tonight or whatever day this is for you.....I'll try to come on ok....I cant gaurantee that.I'll talk to you later ok.....me"
