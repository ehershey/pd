__Letter "Man, do I owe you one hell of an appology.  I didn't forget to call.  I text you than had to put my phone on the charger so I wrote your number down to call.  I should have checked to make sure it was the right number cause it wasn't.  I called twice but kept getting the wrong number.  When I text you again, it was late and if I interrupted anything, sorry.  Again, I'm really sorry about this.  I know better than to just write something down without double checking.Illisse the Enchantress"
