__Letter "Helloe Edge! I have spoken to Rohl about you and he agrees that you soundlike an excellent candidate. :) BUt first, as initiation, we have set fortha task for you. You must obtain one piece of dull brass equipment. Thiscould be a pendant, leggings, chest plate, bracers, helmet, boots, glovesor shield. There are indications of their location somewhere on one of theboards. The mobs to fight are not too daunting for the most part. The keyis the perseverance it may take to obtain one. It will speak volumes to showyour dedication and resourcefulness. And so, you have been tasked, should you choose to accept it. :) Good luck and farewell! Please mail myself, Escobar or Rohl upon completion. Uzamaki/Escobar"
