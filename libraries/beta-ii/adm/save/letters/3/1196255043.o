__Letter "Hey sweet lady,I was just cartwheeling the crap out of some demons and angels, because you've gotta keep a balance. :) And in the midst of thebattle, my mind turned to you. This might not be a surprise asmy mind always turns to you. It's about as natural as slippinga whoopie cushion under Nulvect's chair or spraying Skunk witha seltzer bottle. Or even breathing. :) You're like breath. :)Good breath, not bad breath! Anyways, I hope you're sleepingwell as we speak, getting better, stronger and faster like thebionic woman. :D Talk to you soon, love.Lots o loe, Your Axenos"
