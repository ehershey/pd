__Letter "Hey love, thanks so much for the mail you sent me earlier. It gotme thinking of you...as if I needed help with that. :) I hope youfeel better soon and to help with that, I was inspired to writeyou a poem. I used to write a lot a long time ago but havent doneso in a while. So, here goes. I call it 'Our Dance'You are where you are and I am where I am.That makes what I say next sound surreal,But this very night, I danced with youAnd I swear it felt so real.A slow, sweet song on the radioSent me straight to Cloud Nine.You were somehow there waiting for meAnd you were looking so very fine.We moved to the music, not much needing words.Our eyes intertwined seeemed to say it all.We seem to just glide like thought itself,For on Cloud Nine, you can't fall.Just as long as the song and more real than notWas this brief, sweet rendezvous.So please don't find it strange if sometime I say'You remember our dance, don't you?'------------------------------------------------8/27/08-------I hope you enjoy it and maybe you'll put on a song and I'llbe there to meet you. :) Take care, my love. A speedy recoveryto you and nothing but my best wishes.All my love,Your James"
