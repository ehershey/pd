__Letter "Mudmail from Aziraphale.Ok, I finally got it all together for sending. I have included descriptions for our stones and oils, two new items, perrin, the oil/stones shop, and Rand [)], it's shopkeep. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Our Items:Stones Type: AngrealName: %^ORANGE%^A%^YELLOW%^%^BLUE%^%^RESET%^n%^ORANGE%^g%^YELLOW%^%^BLUE%^%^RESET%^r%^ORANGE%^e%^YELLOW%^%^BLUE%^%^RESET%^a%^ORANGE%^l%^RESET%^'look' description: An Angreal, it is a small figurine of a man praying. The Illuminati use these to focus their magical energies. A small inscription upon the base reads \"rub to unleash the power within'.When rubbed: The Angreal begins to glow as magical energy begins to rush through your body.When it runs out: The Angreal you are holding begins to fade from this world, then disappears completely, it's magical energies exhausted.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Oils Type: HeartstoneName: %^YELLOW%^%^RED%^H%^WHITE%^e%^RED%^a%^WHITE%^r%^RED%^t%^WHITE%^s%^RED%^t%^WHITE%^o%^RED%^n%^WHITE%^e%^RESET%^'look' description: A small round disc made of pure heartstone. It has been enchanted so that when it is rubbed it will absorb the wounds from your body.When rubbed: The Heartstone crumbles and turns to dust as it absorbs your wounds.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Armour type mask: Dimensional maskName: %^WHITE%^D%^YELLOW%^%^BLACK%^i%^RESET%^%^WHITE%^m%^YELLOW%^%^BLACK%^e%^RESET%^%^WHITE%^n%^YELLOW%^%^BLACK%^s%^RESET%^%^WHITE%^i%^YELLOW%^%^BLACK%^o%^RESET%^%^WHITE%^n%^YELLOW%^%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^%^WHITE%^l %^YELLOW%^%^YELLOW%^M%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^as%^YELLOW%^k%^RESET%^AC: Good, like good even. I dunno, make it good.Illuminati wears info: As soon as bring the mask to your face it begins to shimmer and twist as it molds itself to fit your face perfectly.Non-Illuminati wears info: As the mask touches your face it becomes ghost-like, it would be pointless to wear it now as it would not protect you.'look' description: A mask designed to protect your face in combat. The metal it is made from seems to shimmer and change shape even as you look at it.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Armour Type Necklace: Faith PendantName: %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Fa%^YELLOW%^it%^WHITE%^h Pe%^YELLOW%^nd%^BLUE%^ant%^RESET%^Armours: Light armours everything.Special: 5x Regen for hp'look' description: The pendant consists of a small diamond that hangs from your neck by a smooth platinum chain with no apparent links.As you wear it: As you place the pendant around your neck the diamond begins to glow with energy.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Description For Perrin.This is Perrin, the guild's blacksmith. He makes various weapons, armours and items for the Illuminati. He is massively built with broad shoulders and arms like tree-trunks. He is waiting to serve you.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-We'll also need a stones shop for the stones, it's supposed to go in sw of the hall. So here is the description:This strange room has all sorts of odd figurines placed all around on shelves. Each of them radiates with magical energy and has a specific purpose, it would be best not to touch them. At the back of the room is a bench with a man standing behind it, waiting to serve you.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Description for Rand: The guy who sells our stones/oils. (Angreal/Heartstone)Rand Al'Thor, he creates the Heartstones and Angreal for use by the Illuminati. He radiates a very powerful magical aura, perhaps you shouldn't mess with him.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-That's what we were missing I believe. As usual, just tell or mail me if there is a problem with this and I will try to get right on it. I'm not sure how much this is going to cost so it'd be good if you could tell mehow much it is and when/where/how to pay.Oh, and I thought I should ask. Whenever we want to add stuff to the guild, do we just keep mailing you? Or is there someone else who handles all these requests?	- Aziraphale."
