__Letter "sorry to part ways in this manner, but noxus (arma, armageddon btw) is in the guild again, i thought you said he was barred from joining on arma or any alts, hes been disrespectful since added, i told you that last time we spoke, he was talking shit to me when i was on diamond, i switch to zack and he says: \"Noxus <newbie> i knew it was a douche\", being disrespectful to me again. he cares nothing for the well-being of the guild, nor does he care about any member but himself. i removed him, and uzamaki decided to -defend- his actions... so i added noxus back and resigned."
__Undeleted ({"escobar","resolution",})
