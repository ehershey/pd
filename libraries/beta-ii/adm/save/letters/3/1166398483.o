__Letter "Ok, I have already mudmailed Nulvect about this, mostly because I believe he'll login next.  But I was informed it be best I let a few others know of this too...So here goes.  I got to elite today, and went through with the angel quest...But once i completed it, I wasnt an archangel, still lvl 50, and no stat losses.. no change at all.  Just recieved credit for the quest.So I attempted to re-do the quest, because i wanted to become angel...But it says I'v already completed the quest, so I can't.  Now, I know that the reason I wasnt made angel is likely because of me missing something during the quest...dunno for sure...but It wont even lemme do the entire quest anymore to see what I missed.If there is anyway that I can re-do the quest to become archangel, I'd be grateful. (Demon just doesnt speak to me personally...)And any feedback/help from anyone on this is MUCH appreciated. (Even if its feedback telling me to suck up and move on :p)-Patriarch- Pauley Capone."
