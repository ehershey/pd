__Letter "iOr what exactly? Last time I checked you weren't and admin. I can pk whoever Iwant, and if I choose not to pk, then that's my right. Until an admin tells meotherwise I'm not going to pk Artanis or Lucifer, and I don't really feel likekilling faust, since you or another darksoul member might decide to start aguild war about it. Oh, and I thought I should remind you that soulfly andfaust are archangel and demon respectively, and tehy are both in darksoul.You're encouraging guild members to kill each other now are you?Anyway Wraith, you aren't a demon or an archangel so you don't get a say inwhat we do. So until you are either race, stay out of our affairs.Just so you will shut up about it, the archangel and demon races are not yetset in stone, and there may still be large changes done to both races. Untilthe races are finished, the war won't start. Oh, and we are working onsomething to do with the guilds and artanis, so don't you worry, I don't needhelp in this from those who don't know anything that's going on.        - Aziraphale, yes that's right I AM an archangel."
