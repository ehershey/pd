__Letter "Hey. I'm doing the demon quest with this char.However it wont even let me start the quest. I'm level 50 and satanic and i'm doign the \"pray to asmodeus\" thing but it just gives me the you feel a cold chill down your spine message and thats all. Is this because i started as a paladin? If it is could this please be changed? After all angels can be assassins and there are so many more angels than demons already. I'm a paladin who wants to go to the dark side (i'm gonna be kataan btw).Thx"
