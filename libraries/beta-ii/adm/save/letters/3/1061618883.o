__Letter "Ok this is Chrom, i got a favour to ask. Ive lost the password to wishful, i know that normally admins can only give the passwords if its emailed to the person but i didnt put an email on wishful when i made him, but u know my email and u got me on msn as well so if u can, could u be able to give me wishfuls password cause i forgot it.Thanks."
