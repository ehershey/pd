__Letter "when i'm pissed off i can't sit here with him 5 feet from me.  i just want to kick his ass.since i was tired & pissed, i decided to just go to sleep.i had a talk with him after i got off here, i told him \"you know, you work all day, then you come home and work all night.\"\"you spend 0 time with me, ever\" \"you make me feel like work is more important to you than i am, is that true?\"his response was \"i don't know\"  HE DOESN'T KNOW IF WORK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME OR NOT.  i'm really not sure what to do.  nothing i say gets across to him.he just doesn't get it.  why the fuck does he stay with me if he doesn't care about me, it's really irritating.-jen"
