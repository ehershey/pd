__Letter "The old man here in town that is part of that quest has alot of hp and deals very little damage.  I walked upon endbringer outside the old mans home.  I went in and decided to try and kill the old man.  I BS'ed him and it did nothing as far has his HP are concerned.  Then idle attacked him for over 10 mins and he was only at hurting.  If you have the time idle attacking that old man is better than spending the millions on our blade to raise it.Dark Soul"
