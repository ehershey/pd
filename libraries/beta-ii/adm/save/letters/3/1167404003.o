__Letter "I'm mailing this request directly to you and you alone. You prettymuch gave me a free hand on builders and I've basically redesignedthe way the builders can conduct buisness there now.My issue is the Tirun Board. I want either to be able to post therefor builders or be given a sperate board one south of that board forbuilder topics. It's sad that posts about \"moving\" and \"jokes\" areallowed but conducting builder related buisness is not....Alot of builders do not use the same names for their builder as theircharacters. I therefore need a PUBLIC place here on the game todiscuss topics. The board would also let the playing public have aplace to post ideas for things they would like to see come into thegame :)Please Stormbringer. I need a board for builder issues and/or permissionfrom YOU to post freely on the Tirun board about builder topics.You already know how drasically different the system is that i designedfrom the one Nightshade did. I have a feeling that more people wouldhelp out if they know that they can now work on projects together.How can i get the word out to the public if i can't POST it on a board...Ironman"
