__Letter "Wiz is out of control. I have to keep calling him down. He is showing favoritism to the hawaiin platers and I have had it. I understand he hosts for us and all, but this is not good. He needs to stay out of player affairs alltogether, he does not know how to say no and now they have him changing spells. I will not tollerate it seek. If he does not stop, I am gonna hit the road. I love this place and put lots of time I could use making money into it. It is bad when I do something like balance something in a guild then have to go back and redo it because it was changed. So, either he buts out, or I do. Sorry it had to come to this.StomyStormy"
