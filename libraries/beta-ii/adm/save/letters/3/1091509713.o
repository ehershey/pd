__Letter "I, Tsuke, have asked Aislin to post this on the board as a favour.I have heard from various players that there has been quite a bit of argument within the illuminati about my leaving the guild, and how this is a bad thing. So I would like to clear up a few things so that you can all make a decission based on facts, as opposed to rumours, or personal opinion.1. Aziraphale flat out cheated, on more then one occasion. This really dosn't sit well with me, and hasn't for a long time. I'm talking about setting up scripts to xp for him, which was allways against the rules. I'm talking about the 600 MILLION experience points that Aziraphale gave himself with Amarael. I'm talking about getting certain items through the balance when they aren't balanced, like Sa'Angreals and Lifestones and also getting the Hackless version of the holy sword through balance before we were meant to have it. AND then to top it all off, he has gotten away with MINIMAL punishment, mainly I think, due to the admins not knowing the Full Extent of his cheating.2. Illuminati used to stand for a guild that protected the weak, and slew the evil players. As far as I can see now, it has become a guild full of nothing but power hungry players. All the main players do over illuminati line, is strut, and brag about how cool their stats are, or how they could pk someone so easily, but never do. This has annoyed me to no end.Now finally, to finish off this post, I still consider myself friends with some Illuminati members. But i could no longer belong to a guild that supports Aziraphale, and such elitist attitudes. I personally don't have a problem with everyone in the guild, I want to make that abundantly clear. However, in light of this post, i think those that i do have a problem with, should be able to single themselves out.   -- Ka Wo Tsuke Tekudasai, Betrayer of the Light.'The decision has been made, all that is left is to follow through, and accept the consequences'"
