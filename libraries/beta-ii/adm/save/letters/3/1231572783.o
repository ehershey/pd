__Letter "Hi, I did send one to you to convey to him that I hold no ill-feelingsand if I do come on, I won't bother him. I just had to clear the air to move on.I sent copy to Uzamaki.I'm not sure when I'll be back on again, just too much to deal with.Even though I said what I had to, I know I have a long way to go.You must understand that sometimes when a person is under a lot ofstress and trying to cope with difficult situations, they don't know what todo. I also think that because I was talking to Paul so much at our sessionsthat I might think I told you stuff but didn't.I've tried to be a good person and let it go, but Paul said I had to deal withthings and confront those who hurt me in order to move on. If I can't confrontthem, then he would help me get through it. I do have a lot to deal with.My job is still on hold, but I need to work to fulfill myself. Paul also said thatunder stress a person doesn't act rationally, and he wanted me to deal withthe stuff with Nick, but that is hard to do. He was trying to get me to look at my pattern with guys and wants me torecognize it before I make the mistakes again. You were the ideal guy,but I have too much baggage. Josh doesn't know the half of what I wentthrough, but I wanted him to know. Not that I wanted to hurt them, but tosee that I don't hate him. I sent a mudmail to him, but I just want to move on. I will be taking a leave of absence from this mud and trying to rebuildmyself. Maybe the thought that Josh is associated with it makes i too hard. I thought I had told you my Dad was ill, but he never came up toomuch. We had to go for several tests and when I said I had a familyemergency, I wasn't of the right frame of mind to be thinking who Ihad or hadn't told. I haven't been thinking clearly and it is scary.But, I guess I'll just stay off here for awhile, I hope you and Josh stayfriends. In my heart, I know he's a good guy. Take care, your friend always and forever,Rayna"
