__Letter "It's been a few days and i havent gotten any word back yet.Has there been any progress on the sensory system guys ??Has a decision been made about giving me an updated versionof the mudlib so i can intigrate it into builders for youStormbringer ??I have no problem doing the upgrade for builders for you Stormy.I just need a copy of the main port's mudlib places into the tempdirectory /std_current and ill do all the adjustments to it. Oncethe files are adjusted. I'll backup the old /std and move the filesinto /std one at a time, making sure that the mud accepts the changes.Also, I would like a copy of the new commands that Nulvect created.No one on builders will see them but Daos, Cortoth and myself. Iknow Cortoth won't let the cat outta the bag tho. I trust him andfeel you can as well here. You can put them into /IRONMAN/cmds andill do the changes for them too. It's important that the builderscan play around with them for their areas. We need to know how theyact when placed into monsters. We cant do this without copies onthe builders port.I would understand if you wish to wait until Nulvect has intigratedthe sensory system into the mudlib before you give me the updatedmudlib. Just please inform daos and me so i know when i can finishthe upgrade for builders. I need the new mudlib so i can write allthe lfun files.I will be recruting hot and heavy for builders once the sensorysystem is operational on both ports.Ironman"
