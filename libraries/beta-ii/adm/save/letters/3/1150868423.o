__Letter "First, I'd like to nominate both Rohl and Nemo as co-leader.  Reason why I have 2 nominations is because Rohl is a great player and respects the guild and its members as if it were his own, but he has not had the leadership experience.  The reason why I nominate Nemo as well, is because Nemo is always on, he has the experience to be leader, and he does contribute to the guild. He respects the guild and as former leader I will be able to be his advisor, which brings me to my second issue, I would like Ying to be promoted to Masochist.  You may have heard that Yang was dested, I would like Ying to take his place.  She meets the lvl and stat requirements and I will be able to help with guild desicions.  Pls email me back on what you think.Ying blinded with rage"
