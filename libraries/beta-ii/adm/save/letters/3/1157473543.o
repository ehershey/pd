__Letter "It looks like im actually going to have to be resorting to SSD and SSI.Its gonna take me about 4 to 6 months to get through it all. Good newsis that once im done i get all the back money....about 7k of it :POnce that happens, I'll DEFINATELY be back cause i can afford a privatelink for internet again :) Just a few points tho for the mud.    1 ) Finish off the Skills Inherit ....          It's in my directories as targeting.c   2 ) I don't mind ya doing commands except for the ones i talked to         you about already ( aka, cloak/invis, mixed-skills,          shields/buffers) I already got those all balanced out on         paper and should be able to squeeze out a few $ to come on        at some point to code them.If you get a yahoo address, we could chat easily on yahoo. It would make it easier to swap code until i get a more secure link to the internetIronman"
