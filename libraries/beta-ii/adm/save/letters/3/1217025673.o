__Letter "Nulvect it has come to my attention that Backstab has become very skill based. Although I do agree with the use of skills, there is something I wish to comment on. The great difference in our dexterity, his 90 at the time and mine 250, and still he hit. Now I know his agility was only 250 at the time, it's max and his perception maxed as well, however, the great difference in speed is quite a concern to me. Don't take this as a complaint, because it isn't, i love the new backstab more than the old actually, I just wanted to give you my thoughts on the matter. Thanks for the time Nul. Sincerely yours, Piehl the last Last Saint."
