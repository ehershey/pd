__Letter "Hey I hope that you got to school O.K. today, did you try unfolding the couch? I really do think that if you just slept on a surface that was suitable for a guy of your height, you'd sleep a lot better and wake up refreshed instead of in agonizing pain.Also, schedule an appointment with your physician sometime today or tomorrow. Tell him about your problem, and he will probably either give you some advice, or refer you to a specialist (like a chiro). I definately think that something is not aligned properly in your back. I doubt you have a pinched nerve, so let's just hope it isn't that. If it is, you should definately suggest to your doctor that you think it might be that, so he can presribe you some anti-inflammatory medicine, which will cause any swelling of nerves/muscles to go down.If you are still in a lot of pain, practice those exercises, don't do them excessively though. You should try to have ibprofen instead of tylonol, that is a really huge pain reliever. Make sure you don't get addicted to any medications, I don't have a worry that you will though, but just use it as directed.Take Care,Jen"
