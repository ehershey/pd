__Letter "today, folks on newbie were talking about getting impregnated so i started talking about mythology and how zeus turned into a golden shower and impregnated i believe venus (that could be wrong).  I did not mean this in any sexual way, and yet skunk thought I did and started saying why is it yetron was gagged but you didn't get gagged.  I'm like just b/c you took it wrong doesn't mean it was. What i said had no sexual context in it, b/c in mythology, sex is rarely a way of pregnating someone.  Am I wrong?  Yeah, it is something that could be taken wrong, but when you're talking about mytholology and not sex and everything, I think people should be mature enough to realize it was ntohing sexual or bad.  It's not my fault he thinks only about sex.  Am I wrong?  If so I apologize, but I do not see how i was in the wrong.thanks"
