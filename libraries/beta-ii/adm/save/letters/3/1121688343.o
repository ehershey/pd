__Letter "this is still that same mail..I dont care much any more, because they have those chars...and i guess that they worked for them.Any way... I dont care that you have a dragon, i coudlnt care what colour it is.Last night i was angry at the IMM's, not you, not smokeyTho.. i did get your remark on Dragon line about eating your shit...You nasty girl!Hope this clears up the fact that am NOT pissed at youand am over the whole issueHope that you and I can put this behind us, and move onHope we are cool still.. and that you will talk to meagain.*hugs*Orcha."
