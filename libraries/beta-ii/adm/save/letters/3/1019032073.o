__Letter "Hi. just a little pk stuff. Tonight Besnell/Lac/Lich all attacked me at once. Paralyze + Backstab + Slash. Basically the works. Naturally they all died.So i have 3 pk things on me. Just wanted to let ya know its not a pk spree, but all 3 at once in the same room (area attack) and it was completely in defense of myself (i was attacked not the other way around).Is there anyway i can get any of this taken off my record since it was pure self defense? if not thats fine.Thx stormy"
