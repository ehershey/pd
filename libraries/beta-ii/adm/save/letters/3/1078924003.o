__Letter "I know you wanted me to drop the Helena thing, and I really was going to. As I told Nightshade, I deleted the post and everything. But nightshade also suggested to me that I read what people had responded with.. and I did...so either Helena broke a rule, or aziraphale broke a rule. But Helena is the imm, not aziraphale...An imm isn't supposed to share private information about a player to another player like that. It's no one's business. In light of that information, I have to defend myself, and I have to bring light to that fact. I think Aziraphale and Helena meant to make it look like maybe *I* could be a cheater because I have a shell account on TGI, okay well what they said was, I mud from localhost, same as wiz...so now apparantly I'm a cheater, but I guess they failed to realize that anyone would notice the fact that sharing that information is wrong...Anyway, I really don't want to disappoint you or NS. I don't want to lose your friendship. Today you made me feel like I was going to. I never would ever try to undermine NS. You have to understand that. I don't know if Paul truly understands that fact yet, but I have nothing but respect for you, him and djerr. If I didn't have respect for him, I'd never bother telling hiim anything. Not to say I don't respect other.. admins and imms..but I guess, I just think NS is more capable of...well you know he knows what he's doing as opposed to..well you know.Sigh.I'm really worried at this point that I am about to lose your friendship. But I have to risk it for what I think is right. Everything you were told about all the situations were taken completely out of context. I never made threats to NS that I was going to quit ethereal if he didn't ban Helena from the guild. I asked him and argued him for less than 5 minutes to block her. He told me it would never happen. I told him exactly this: I don't think I want to own a guild anymore... He said Okay, I said bye, that was that. I go to Paul so often whenever I have problems on PD because I don't feel like I can go to Daos or Whit. If you want to know why, ask Djerr, show him this mail so he knows that I'm giving him permission to tell you. Actually I think NS might know why... I forget if I told him on the phone earlier...Anyway...I also ask Paul lots of questions. Not to annoy him, but because I know he's the only person who can enlighten me. I'm curious about a lot of things on PD. Like the other day I asked him about why we have to type give # type coins to player instead of give # type to player (when giving money), and he did a very good job explaining it to me. I wasn't complaining, I was genuinely interested. Most of the time I'm scared shitless to even talk to him. Sometimes it takes me a few hours or a few days to finally get up the balls to message hiim or mail him about anything. But I'm a very curious person. I have also praised him a few times with things he has done, and I've always supported him behind his back when people talk to me about him. I'm not out to \"get\" anyone. Just help everyone. I would think YOU of all people would know me better than that.I'm sorry to disappoint you. I hope you understand where I'm coming from on this. It isn't like I'm pulling anything out of thin air. Helena messaged me the other day, asking me why she was on my list of people I don't really like too much, and I told her. Because she's still in a guild, after becoming an imm, yes I realize other admins/imms do it, and I frown upon that as well. But, whatever. And I also said because I didn't like the way she became an immortal. Simply because you're bored, doesn't really justify something like that. In that respect, everyone on PD should be an imm...okay maybe not everyone. I also told her that I hoped she would be doing something to benefit the mud in only a way an imm can. Then she started accusing me of giving out Illuminati code to Epic. I was shocked. I have never had access to any Illuminati code, that I was at least aware of. I tried to tell her that, but she jumped back at me telling me I can easily have access, because I mud from localhost, which wiz also muds from. I explained that I only had a basic shell account and 0 access to PD, which is perfectly fine and PD is safe from the harm of the almighty kumi (gah)...and i explained the difference of having root access as opposed to just being a regular user, and she got mad and told me that she knew the difference, so I asked her to tell me what it was, and she told me she wouldn't. So I told her I was done speaking to her, and she'd remain on my list of people i'm disappointed in until she benefitted PD in a way that she'd need imm status to do so, and blah blah blah. that was all. I never told that to nightshade, I dunno how he learned of this. I'm guessing she complained to him, and left a few -minor- details out. I pasted most of the conversation I had with Helena to Djerr, that time, so he can definately back me up on any of this.  I have no reason to hide anything.The reason I'm bothering to write you such a long mail is because I don't want to lose your friendship over something so trivial. I feel that we are friends, and have been friends, and in a sense , up to a certain extent, have eachother's trust. By the way you were treating me when I woke up this morning, I felt like our friendship would be over, and I don't want that. Again, I am not trying to have authority over anyone here. I am trying to look out for the best interest of everyone, I dunno why I do this, but I just do...I realize it puts me in a bad situation a lot. But if I believe in something enough.. well you know. Anyway, I hope that this cleared some things up to you. I dunno what other issues you might have with me at this point, but I'd love to discuss them all with you, because I don't want any bad air between us. I'm not asking for you to AGREE with me on anything, it's fine and normal for us to disagree on everything in this world, but I don't see why that should stop us from being friends.Sorry for writing so much. I hope you understand.-Jen"
