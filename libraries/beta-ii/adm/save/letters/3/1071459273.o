__Letter "hey nightshade i accidently killed leviathas when we were in merk.  When i took him back to his corpse i forgot to truce him and he was mounted on me so he died (whilist in the air) and when i landed he was still on my back as a ghost and i was an outlaw is there any chance this can be fixed?"
