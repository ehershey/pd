__Letter "I had a thought for two new races. The following is the outlinesfor each one;  a) Pegasus     1) This race would be another flyer as well as a steed.     2) Due to it's lack of arms, The race would SUCK for melee.        It would also lack the ability to wield anything for the        same reason.     3) THe magical nature of this creature would give it a major        boost in the magical skills.     4) Wisdom, Intelligence and charisma would be at low cost.     5) Dexterity would be high cost.     6) Strength would be normal costs. It is a kind of horse after        all. Constitution would be normal costs as well for the same        reasons.  b) Unicorn     1) This class wouldn't be able to wield weapons either due to        a lack of arms.     2) The horn of the unicorn would act as a built in wand. It        would have a spell built into the horn unique to unicorns.        The spell will be defined later on.     3) Magical skills would be raised.      4) Melee and combat skills would be lowered.     5) Wisdom and Intelligence would be VASTLY cheaper.     6) Charisma, strength and constitution would be normal costs.        It is a horse after all.     7) Dexterity would be majorly expensive.BOTH of these classes would be quest-only races. I intend on buildingthem into the Atlantian Area. You all know how hard i design my quests. I therefore wanted to grant proper prizes for the hell im intendingputting the players thru in Atlantis :)Please mail back to me about the idea. If you folks like the concept,I'll go ahead and define the body types on builders. This way we canrough out the designs for these two races.The intention with these two races is to grant mages and clerics tworaces that are intensely magical in nature while sucking in weaponand melee combat. They would be powerhouses with magic. Hand to handor weapon to weapon.... a 5 year old with a stick could own them :PFighters and clerics have demons and archangels. I just feel it's timethe mages/clerics get two races for their magical properties.Ironman"
