__Letter "Hey i got a wierd request:I got a lot of RL stuff that i really need to do. The thing is if i have PD around I will just come on here instead of doing it. So could you plz store my chars and ban me until May 15th? Thats probably the only way i can make myself do what I need to do in RL.Thx, and I hope everything works out for you in RL"
