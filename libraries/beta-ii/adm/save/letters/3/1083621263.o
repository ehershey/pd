__Letter "Woot! Glad to hear it was put to some use. ^_^ I'll polish up the code a bit and then I'll hand it out if you want... or it can just be there, everyone knows how to get to it, hehe. :) And about the date, no problem. An emergency is an emergency. I hope you feel better!  --Hugs and snugs, Ven. :D"
