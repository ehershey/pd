__Letter "Clerics should be your next class to work on Nul.  At lower lvls pain wound hurt do the same ammount of dmg and to have 3 spells that are almost the same is silly.  Plus i got para at lvl 7 and it failed me til lvl 24 so it should be changed to either be a higher lvl spell or fixed i dunno your the genious at this stuff.  And then nwo im lvl 34 and it sort of works it still only paras 4 rounds and thats what it done when it worked earlier on too.  Its a fun class but no one uses us as support they go for the druids now with there buffs.  So some new spells or something like that would be awesome but ill leave that up to you.Adios"
