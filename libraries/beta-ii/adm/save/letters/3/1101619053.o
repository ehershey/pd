__Letter "Hi, I have written a description for a stuffed petA cute little pandaThere was once a baby panda, who through some bizarre coincidence, ended up in the forests of Merkkirri. Evading the relentless xpers destroying his habitat, he eventually befriended a nearby shaman, who fed him and gave him a place to live. One day, an adventurer from distant lands killed the shaman, hoping to find great power in the staff he wielded, but disappointed at finding nothing, he adopted the little panda as his own pet. They were later both slain by an army of gnolls, and the panda was stuffed to decorate the mantlepiece of the gnoll commander. The little stuffed panda sat there gathering dust for many years, before it was picked up by the Gods and used as second prize in a trivia contest.Hope you like it, and thanks in advance for making itPirsq"
