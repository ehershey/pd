__Letter "Sorry to bother all three of you with this, but not sure who's actively doing things with guilds.I've been having quite a few problems since Dab became an Imm. First, it was not being able to withdraw from my treasury. Now, I can't even promote, demote, or reject people. I haven't tried to induct anyone, since I wouldn't be able to reject them, but I suspect I might not even be able to do that. The guild is Dragon Warriors for those that don't know.There was a problem with Dab, too, which I'm too tired to explain now. If you want details, ask me sometime. In short, his position in the guild is bugged somehow. If you can, just totally remove him I guess, since an Imm probably shouldn't be in a particular guild."
