__Letter "O.k. Don't take this the wrong way or anything, but I have to leave the guild. Or more like I'm gonna not have to. But N*e wayz, the reason is is that I got a really good offer from Blackforce's new leader that he's let me be co-leader of the guild. I had already had an offer to join the guild but I turned it down. Only this time I'm not. It's got nothing to do with Forsaken or anything, I actually didn't want to at first but, you know. Another reason is that Blackforce isn't really a strong pk guild and I really don't like the idea of pk. It also has nothing to do with Soulfly and AoD. Well sorry bout all this. Hope ya'll aren't mad or anything.Luv ya, Mocha.P.s I'm posting all this on the guild board. Hope it's o.k."
