__Letter "  Ok Dude... I made my 100 million.. and jumped 11 levels to 55. I could have hit 56, but I boosted dex one, wisdom one... and int 4 instead. Now all I have to do is fill in these level jumping \"shoes\" with skills and all, and I should be set. I've got 1770 hp now... about 100 more than I had... 820 sp, and 1155 mp (which means lots of snowballs I guess). I'll be sitting here for a while now I've decided... till I can get int up in the 50's, dex and str to 75 or 80... then I'll move on. That'll take about another 100 million... but that will take a while. I need a hard-core xping break for a bit. At least when alone. Catch you on later. Ryan"
