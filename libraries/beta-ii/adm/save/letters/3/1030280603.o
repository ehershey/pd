__Letter "Short version: I want to be cleric with an archangel, getting to 50 and remorting or doing archangel quest defeats the purpose. Being set as cleric would be *very* nice. With guild war coming up and holy war meaning something now - I need to get very powerful ver fast, and I cannot do that with a paladin, since clerics have cheaper skills, get better spells, do more damage and cure more and faster.When I became archangel I saw that paladins were going to be getting revamped, since they are my favourite class, I thought to be one so I could see if they got cool spells and/or abilities. - However, after seeing how slow I exp, how long it will take me to do any damage, and after being pk'd 3 times by assassins. I see that I am going to need to be the class that I am fastest at exp'ing with: cleric. With the guild wars coming sometime soon this it is important to have a cleric for scry, mheal and paralyze.If I can't be set to cleric (Level 1, rolled stats, no skills of course) then please consider giving paladins a good attack ability and some MD spells. Smite in my directory (builders) and the spell 'shield', for example.Bah, so much for short version, that's just telling it like it is. %^CYAN%^*** %^BOLD%^WHITE%^Aziraphale 'Prator' Amakiira %^RESET%^CYAN%^***"
