__Letter "no, you want to stop insults, then no, i will insult you any way, and any how i feel like it, and coding oh great, so you coded something, ain't you special, maybe when you finish, i'll complain and cry and whine about how broken it is and how terribly coded it is and how it should be. so untill your area, this area that don't exist anywhere at this time mind you, comes in, then it shall and will be said your. but know what, my work is obvious, yours isn't, you take the easy way and when its no longer easy, you look for an easier way. So like i said before, fuck you and your guild. You and your guild will die"
