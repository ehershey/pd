__Letter "Before boot i brang my bard on to see if any changes had been made etc. and i sung song of fates a few times to myself. and i noticed that the hp given actually stayed. the con went back down but the hp was permanent. I sung the song till i had around 2800 hp. then i quit out to see if it lasted. And it Did. i didnt go xp or anything i idled for abit then went l/d. now i tried it again today after boot and it looks like it may have been fixed i do not know. maybe you should check the coding of the song might have a few glitches in it.Liquid will sing for Food"
