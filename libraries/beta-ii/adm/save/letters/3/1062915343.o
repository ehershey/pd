__Letter "Heya Wiz,Just letting you know that I won't be on PD anymore   =/I guess it would be best if I not be. I feel that I'm only bothering you guys. I feel that I must focus my timeon things that need my uninterupted attention. Not to put you guys down, but I feel that this is the right thing to do.Anyway, it was great to meet such an extraordinary person like you.You are one of a kind, in a good way.  =)I know what you are doing is going against the grain, but it willsurelay pay off in the near futurel. So keep on keeping on and make it count bro.  =)you can always reach me at rtdate@hotmail.com if ya need to.I just feel it's the best for now.Anyway it was my pleasure to meet you bro and hopefully soon willdo again. Best WishesRonnie aka Penny"
