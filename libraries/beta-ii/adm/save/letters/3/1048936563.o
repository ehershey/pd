__Letter "I've made a suggestion on the board, but here is another one.  I would like to make a pk free guild.  Just for those who like to explore, build up a character without the threat of being pk'd just for the fun of it.  Only the players in the guild would be flagged, and if anyone is found to be there and cause trouble they would be booted.  This would not hinder normal deaths, but something has to be done and seeing as I'm pretty much the only one who wishes to try something that is what i would like to do.Wisp"
