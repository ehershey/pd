__Letter "Message 104 by Faust: LeviIf there is no penalty for being pk'ed by a player, then there is no loss, eqis easilly replaced and don't count. Money, well, depends on what level, atlevel 20, i was able to make a few mil in a day of heavy xping. So if death ina PvP is down graded, then there should be no penalty. The reason there is ajustice system is to make sure people don't go on pk spree's, you get 3murders, you get executes. You take lives, you pay with yours. if a pk is aslap on the wrist, then why have a harsh justice, why not have the guard takeaway your dagger or armor, then hey, its equal. So no sense changing it.%^RED%^-Faust brings death to you people who idle in safe zones.P.S. I think its harrassment when someone can idle in a safe zone and not letme kill them :(%^RESET%^Just highlighting in red the part that I found offensive.  I have avoided many oportunities to flame Faust at your request.  I thought you asked the same of him?Lev"
