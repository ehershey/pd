My system, /adm/simul_efun/security_screen.c , takes on thesefuntions and allows us to grand read or write abilities to the dirs too.The BuildSecure.c was an all or nothing prospect. Please come look overthe file bud :) You will be happy with my work :) If your not, I'llreturn those controls to BuildSecure.cIronman"
