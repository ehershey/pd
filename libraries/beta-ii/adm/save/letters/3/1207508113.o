__Letter "I was thinking, that for the next while, I'm not going to be too reliable fortimes.  I mean, I may promise or want to be with you, but because of myhealth right now, please don't take it personally.  I want to be with you,but I can't make promises, so if I don't show up or don't stay long, it's onlybbecause I'm not well right now.I feel bad for not being on and now it seems all I do is sleep, rest, watch tv,and all boring stuff lolI will try to be on and off all day, so I hope to talk to you.  Maybe tonightI'll try to convince Trevor that I'm okay to sit up for awhile.  It seems sittingfor awhile and concentrating is hard to do lolmiss you tonslove, your Rayna"
