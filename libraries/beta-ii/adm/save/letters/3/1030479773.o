__Letter "Thinking of you.  Not really much else is going on *winks*  I'm going to try and get a job today.  Or at least apply to a few.  Heath and I have been having some highway troubles as well it seems...  I'll tell you about it later.  Nothing serious...  just annoying and somewhat funny *smiles*  We went to the ju-jitsu place last night, it was pretty cool...  Only thing is, it's 50 bucks a month.  Hence...  the job searching.  *grins*  Although, that money could be better spent on phone cards so I can make a few phone calls......   The \"friends getting along\" issue isnt ending up to be a problem.  Mike lives pretty far away now, so all of them hanging out isnt an issue.  They all really dont like each other, but there's not much I can do to change that.  Otherwise, both groups are doing well.  John and Rachel both got good jobs, and ryan's enjoying his new major (auto repair), and mike got transferred to the toy dept at his work (which he loves).  Anyway, I gotta go apply to some places before they close.  I miss you immensely.  *sighs deeply and hugs you, unwilling to let you go*  I hope to hear from you soon.                                -Your Paul"
