__Letter "I have been given a guild quest already. I found the star scream sword on merkerri and will turn it over to Dab or Whit if I dont see you first.As for why I joined this guild...it is because you invited me. I like to think you saw something in me that you believed would benefit this guild. My own reasons have to do with you as the leader morethan anything else. You showed me that you wanted a guild that represents good and although my character is demonic, I want that to only apply to how I act towards NPCs rather than players. I kill whatever I want in this game. I hope that my skills as an assassin will benefit the guild in whatever it chooses to do with them. I am ambivalent about my alignment for the most part; it is the result of the places where I currently hunt.What I want from this guild is to enjoy having people to call upon when I need help with the game and/or the hunt. I can offer what knowledge I have of the mud to any member of the guild, my gold is the guild's gold if ever it is needed, I will gladly party with members when asked and I enjoy helping newbies...not just for recruiting purposes.The guild can ask whatever it requires of me and be assured that I will deliver or die in the attempt.Peem - \"meeps\""
