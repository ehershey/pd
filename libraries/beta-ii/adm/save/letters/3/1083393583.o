__Letter "Today i accidentally pked someone when they walked into the room i was breathing in and they got killed in one hit. This is my first pk and i didnt know what would happen so when i went to jail i lost my stuff, including 16 black diamonds and i have a murder offence: 1 on my criminal record. I feel this is somewhat harsh since it was an accident so i was wondering if u could reimburse all or some of the diamonds back and remove the criminal record because i was told that if u have too many u can get dested, which i felt is fairly harsh considering i dont pk and this is my first pk and it was an accident. If nothing can be done, i can understand, i just feel this is very harsh for a first offence. Thanks"
