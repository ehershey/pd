__Letter "i got your tell about your friend who can't connect. i have a couple of other people who have characters on the Mud who also can't connect. they simply timeout when they get to the login page. My suggestion is to talk to stormy or NS about it, and find out if, First, their character has for some reason been banned along with their IP. Then if it has, well, thats an issue they're going to have to sort out with the Admins. If they aren't banned, then still talk to stormy and NS, because sometimes when they ban people, they just ban the whole spectrum of IP, from for instance AOL, instead of the individual IP.apart from that, there's nothing much I can do, or you :-\\ sorry i'm not very helpful, but NS and Stormy really are the ones with all the answers.Helena."
