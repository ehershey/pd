__Letter "Hey thanks for helping out with balance. Here is my perspective as demon antipaladin lvl 57.Gore. Currently it is not useful. It does the same damage as jab/rush. For being a quest race i had to give up a level 50 to become, we deserve a bit stronger abilitiesMassacre.  About 750 damage but takes two rounds. This is less damage than if I just jabbed (400 each jab).Vortex:  This is too strong. 700 damage from a lvl 50. Room attack too. WAY too strong.Chaoswave:   600 damage at lvl 50. Still too strong. Nova:   I've heard this kills rhondale in 3 rounds with low stats at lvl 50. If so then its the same case as vortex. In general mp users have an advantage over sp classes. Stones give back mp non stop and in good ammounts. Ointment is only 100 per round and you cant do anything else while applying. When your abilities take 200 sp each thats a LOT of down timeThanks again,-- Vyce"
