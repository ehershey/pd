__Letter "If you get a chance to help me out, just sign on to Zynna and create Stormbringer there.  What I'm trying to do is make race specific spells/abilities.  If I had just one example or if that idea had already been implemented on Zynna I'd have no trouble figuring it out on my own but since I dont have examples im stuck. I have seen these ideas implemented here and I'm guessing from scratch like the swipe ability for a race and your Dragon class.  Zynna does not have alot of players.  I'm doing this admin position there out of respect for the first mud I ever played and immortaled on.  The owner of the mud is Harley Hahn who writes internet books.  I was approached by him after the last admin could not perform his duties anymore and the players wrote Harley asking to make a new admin.  He had my contact info from a previous complaint about the lack of leadership for the mud.  While Harley and I were discussing what to do the ten or so players we had all left, upset at the lack of progress of the mud.  I was made Admin.  If you remember I immortaled for you for a short while.  My only \"claim to fame\" for PD is the few items I made for Forsakens guild weapons. After that I got bored and created a character here and cheated, for which I was removed from a coder.  I have matured alot since those times and took the job over there.If you could be my \"Expert\" advice that would be so great.  I have a 2 man team to help over there on the coding (Hexous and Timbo) but they are limited by experience and the lack of good coding from previous wizards.  Please give me a hand.  I'm getting so frustrated I want to just quit.Samson on Zynna"
