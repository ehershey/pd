__Letter "this is more of a MUD prolem but I feel it needs to be brought upturn onEven if I am just sitting in my lil room of the tirun board or in my guild hall, I am constantly badgered by arma, which gets ironman annoyingly involved. I have asked them all to just not talk to me and leave me alone b/c I am tired of them turning everything into a fight.  This is a game, it is meant to be fun..a place for people to get away from their real life and play and talk a lil with some friends. But they constantly speak down to me and noone does anything about it, which forces me to stand up for myself b/c i am tired of their shit. I think that people need to be reminded that this is a place of fun, not a place of \"my dad can beat up your dad\" jevenile(sp) bull shit. Do what you wish, but I know I am not the only one that feels this way. ThanksCarina"
