__Letter "The game went fairly well...  with the exception of Ryan and I getting our loot stolen *growl*  We worked hard for that loot, so now we're trying to get it back.  We had to do quite a bit of planar hopping to track down the suspects, but at the moment we're eyeing a museum that collects unique weapons (my loot was a lance that can absorb a person's soul, and ryan had two sentient swords).  Ryan doesnt have much for backup weapons, although only one of his swords were stolen, and it just so happens that MY soul is within the lance..  so although I'm basically immortal....  I still need the lance.  There were a few battles, the occasional slaughtering of innocents, and so on, but we must get our loot back at any cost *grin*  Yeah, we're not exactly what you would call \"heros\".  At least we dont start the fights.  Usually.  Well, Ryan's character does have a tendancy to slap people that dont cooperate...  but hey.  They should have cooperated :D  Our games are usually lighthearted and entertaining...  havent had much of a serious game.  I'd love to play one with you and your friends sometime, or at least watch one.  (I'm still a bit intimidated by all your RP skills :P )  But I better get to bed.  I have a feeling tomorrow's going to be a long day.  Goodnight, Jenna.                       -Paul"
