__Letter "May I politely ask what you thought of my proposal that I take over where Venenum left off. And I'd also like to reiterate that Vene wouldn't mind coming back if Daos won't be so.... rude to him this time. Many players miss Venenum and the work he was doing on PD, and we were all eagerly awaiting his large area.I would like to imm for a few months to get some work done.I know I made a couple of mistakes, but I was always totally honest about them.Hmm, see you."
