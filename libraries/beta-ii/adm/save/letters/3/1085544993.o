__Letter "Stormy- this is what I have so far. Feel free to change or whatever. :DThis guidelines are by no means 'rules'; just that, guidelines. They are flexible to a point, some more then others, but they are things to always keep in mind when acting as an immortal for Primal Darkness.%^CYAN%^Your privilages:%^RESET%^  **Immortals have the privilage of viewing all guild, class, subclass and race lines at all times (exceptional circumstances aside)- but their ability to speak over guild lines is subject to the owner of said guild. This, however, only applies to 'chat'- random conversation that has no meaning towards business. Business talk can always be made over guild lines, no matter the wish of the owners of the guild. Long story short- guild leaders may ask an immortal to stop chatting over their line or with their members over their line, but business (guild announcements, warnings, etc) takes priority.  **Immortals are considered staff. To this end, they are covered under rule #2 which states in part:  All of the Staff are to be respected.  Players may hold their own opinions, and voice them as they see fit- but there is a fine line between having an opinion and slander. If a player's opinion is extremely negative, advise them to keep their opinions to themselves. This includes guild lines.  **Immortals have the privilage of keeping order in the MUD whenever admins are not present. This means that, sometimes, an immortal may have to act arbitarily and unilaterally- their judgement should be respected by players, but some log or acknowledgement should be kept, including posting on the immortal board, mailing an admin, etc. It should be noted the punishments they can hand out are limited; they can only bestow non-lasting punishments. Forcing a player to drop their equipment, removing stats, skills, levels, experience or anything which has a lasting effect is not permitted, let the admins deal with that. However, gagging unruly players who spam or curse, imprisonment in non-escapable rooms for players on a PK rampage, etc, is permitted.  **Immortals have the privilage of invisibility at all times, unless requested to stop or cut down by an admin. Any immortal who's job requires player contact should spend as much time as they can stand (at least 50% of their time online) visible- any less and it will significantly impact on their ability to do their job.  **Immortals have the privilage of visibility at all times, unless requested to stop or cut down by an admin.  **Immortals have the privilage to idle as much as they wish, but bear in mind that such may affect the way you do your job. If players assume you are idle they are probably less likely to contact you. Therefore, an admin who's job requires player contact should log off (or become invisible) when they do not wish to be active.  **Immortals have the privilage of knowing things players should not know- what projects the admins are working on, expected release days, chat on cre line, etc. Such should be kept quiet- staff business should remain staff business.  **Immortals are not obliged to follow any command that comes from a player, even if that command is given by an admin through proxy- it's too open to abuse. Rather, only commands which are given by admins (or relayed by other members of staff without going through or coming from a player) should be obeyed.%^CYAN%^Your responsibilities:%^RESET%^  **Immortals must abide by rule #2, a portion of which is copied below for the benefit of the reader.  The Primal Darkness Staff is not allowed to help mortals in any way unless it is to fix some kind of bug. Any player and or staff member who breaks this rule will be instantly rid and banned for life.  This includes, but is not limited to: gold, experience, items, resurrection, death, revenge, race changes, remorting, transportation to or from an area, quest info... in short anything which helps a player at all or something which other players cannot get (including unapproved custom items). This includes information passed off-MUD (chat programs, IRL, etc).   **Immortals should try to interfere with the game as little as possible. Jumping to players without their permission, transporting players away without their permission, echoall messages, funny objects, quotes echo'd to players; all are funny and witty, but ultimately disrupt gameplay. Messages put over regular lines is fine, as lines can be blocked, but echoalls should be avoided unless for business.  **Immortals should respond to player queries as soon as possible- if only to tell them where to go to get their answers. No reasonable player query or request should be ignored, and even unreasonable ones should be given a reason why they cannot have an answer or their request granted.  **Immortals are required to be polite and professional towards players at all times, although chats which take place off-MUD (chat programs, IRL, etc) are not bound by that requirement. Messages in tells, says, or on builders port are considered to be \"on-MUD\".  **Immortals should respect the privacy of other Immortals. Jumping to Immortals without knowing what they are doing could cause problems. The cre line is good for chat- but ask before jumping to other immortals or wisking them away to places unknown.  **Immortals must keep guild information confidential. The statistics for one guild's weapon, the chat happening over a guild line, should be secret to other players- other staff can be told.   **Immortals must obey any reasonable request the admins make to the best of their ability. After all, that's what we're here for, right?  **Immortals are held to a higher standard then players are. Swearing, even swearing that is automatically filted, should be avoided. If you feel you are loosing your temper you should tell the player to go see an admin and log off.  **Immortals should not give away game secrets (formulas to spells/abilities, skill requirements for spells, etc). Such things are best left to players to discover.  **While immortals are ment to have fun too, at least 50% of an immortal's active playtime should be spent 'on duty'- that is, doing whatever job you are assigned to do. Building, sorting out player problems, taking player feedback, searching for rule breakers- etc. We arn't here to chat, but to do our jobs.  **Immortals have a responsibility to keep the mud balance in mind in all things. No code should be added which is unbalanced, buggy, of poor quality or unchecked. If you encounter such code, contact an admin about it- have them put it in if necessary."
