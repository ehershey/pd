__Letter "I was in roston xping and I accidently kill the law person in the []. Now because he's such a low level mob I didn't get a chance to realise that I had attacked him and he died in 1 round. This has made me outlaw. I have 5 previous Murder offences and now 1 Minor offence and I was wondering that if I went to go spend time would the law system kill me? I have died not too long ago thereby removing my old outlaw status and I really do not want to die again. I was wondering that because this was an accident could you please remove my outlaw status?Thanks for your time.  --Eios."
