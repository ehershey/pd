__Letter "Sorry, love. I shouldve specified that I sent it via normal emailto your yahoo.ca account. It was so much easier, hehe. Also, Imissed you last night. I thought you'd be back after reboot sinceit didnt seem like a proper goodbye. I guess you were tired. Itwas getting late. Last night was kinda crazy after you left. Iwas partying with Cyan as Uzamaki and he was a lil infuriatingstopping to IM folks. I guess it was infuriating when my fmuderr, gmud would glitch up. Then, after like 10 mil, Zack logs on.Zack is all saying someone better be unidle so jokingly I sayshh to Cyan on the line. Turns out Zack's gf/fiancee dumped himand he was hurting in a bad way. I try to talk to him and helphim feel better and it was an hours long process but I think Iwas able to do him some good. Anyway, I think God wanted me tobe able to help him and so used the fact that I didnt go in towork. :) I think he realized some things which opened his eyesa little. I keep you updated. :)Loving you soooooooooooooooo much,James"
