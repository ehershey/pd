__Letter "30-35:	/d/lodos/secret3	Items you get:  Mirror		1. Consult a ranger and get \"poison\" herbs, then go to the secret area 				in lodos (the one in the west tower just north of the [])			2. \"Get bone\" - This will allow you to take the bone and then \"spread 				herbs on bone\" - will then make the bone flamable so you can \"Rub bone 				on altar\" - creating fire to \"warm the dried blood\" - so you can drink 				it.			a. Once you drink the poisoned blood, you will lose 5-10 stat 					points in all of your stats.  This is your sacrifice for this 					round of the quest.				3. Once you drink the blood the top of the altar will slide off, 				revealing a mirror, which you will then take.			a. once you pick up the mirror it will pull you into a vision 					showing you the next part of the quest (riddled of course).***notes:  This quest can only be done once a year: at Dusk (between the first night global and the second night global) on Qualtiar 13th.  This will also have a level check.40-45: /d/freepk/merkkerri/jungle/gcity/gcity53 and /d/freepk/merkkerri/jungle/gcity/gcity77 and /d/freepk/keys/great_sand/sand1	Items you get: Book		       Key		       Daywalker Cloak		1. Go into merk and defeat the merk queen (shazalla or w/e her name is), 		once you do (if you're in the correct lvl range) a book will fall onto 				the altar.  Which you then grab.  You will also need the Ruby Key from 				the Queen as well.		2. Go to the merk Sage (in the library west of the fake Queen) and hand 			him the book.			a. He will tell you to go to the island of \"crabs\" and dig up 					something old from something wrecked.		3. Go to Crab Island find the wrecked ship and \"dig through wreckage\" to 		find a coffin (this coffin was \"Drac's\" coffin which never got to him 				b/c of the wreckage).			a. The Ruby Key, combined with the rogues \"lockpick\" will form 					the \"Coffin Key\" (syntax will be \"combine ruby key and 						lockpick\")  This syntax will be on the side of the coffin.				1.
