__Letter "Hello there, my sweetest of sweet ladies. :) I forgot to send amail right after work. I was incredibly tired! Boy, howdy! And Ispent a little while looking for you today. I hope your day wentwell. Mine went about as okay as a day without you can go. :) Imight be gearing up for a nap. But I just wanted to tell you thatI miss you, care about you, think of you and loe you. :) That'sa lotta stuff! Hope all is well with your Dad. See you later!Love,James"
