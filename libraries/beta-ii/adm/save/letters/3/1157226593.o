__Letter "which long email did you mean? I did get 3 mudmails from you.Two of them were titled \"hey\" and one was titled \"sory\". Wasthere another mudmail? Are you still at a friend's house to use the internet?Hope you get it up soon. Ghan said on newbie (lol) that hewas better than you, I said no-one is better than my Endy, heheI went on as Rayna and told Zub that I had surgery, so hopefullyhe won't connect the two (hehe)."
