__Letter "    [HFunny things about muds, I always thought they were games to play andenjoy.Funny thing about admins, I always thought they were cool and easy going.UntilI talked to Petrarch on Intercre one time. For those of you who do not knowintercre is a chat line between muds. Well you see, I admin on a mud calledPrimal Darkness, been there for nearly 2 years. Well one day Petrarch getsonthe high and mighty horse he rides and tells us all how totally idiotic hispayers are. How he could care less for even one of his players, how he had10players to take the place of every dumbass player who quit this place. Hewenton to degrade his players and to him, they are nothing but cattle. I willprobably be rid and banned from this mud for this post, but I do not reallycare. I have been a player here for a long time, since the week beforePetrarchdid the player wipe he called the \"crash\". You know what I have learned ofthealmighty Petrarch? 98% of the mudding community hate him not because of his--More-- (45%) [hit <enter> or <space> to contine or <q> to quit]    ability, but because of his theft of ideas. I do not know if it is true,buttruely I do not care, this is my farewell post. I shall not return. Tothose ofyou that catch this post before it is removed, I say farewell and ask youolderplayers to pass it onto anyone whom may care. This is no attempt to bringanyof you to my mud nor an attempt to piss you off, this is me speaking mymind ofthe things I have sen the past few years.... apply salve for Pet stealing ideas, I have but one thing to say: We did a command onPDcall partyrange and a day or two later it was put into play here. So makeyourown judgments on that, and to you all I say GoodBye. I will suicide myself and all of my alts from here, my wife still playshere--More-- (90%) [hit <enter> or <space> to contine or <q> to quit]Unrecognized command.and I hope she is allowed to stay as she has freinds here and has no idea Iamposting this nor ciding my character."
