__Letter "Hey bro sup.  Just got a quick question, was xping today and cenn repetedly tried to pk me, doughboy, rhaetvih and a buncha ppl.  He eventually killed me, then went to tirun to serve.  I didnt know of the no Tirun pk rule, apparently cenn did, and knew of a bug that would allow me to attack him in tirun jail-so i did and killed him back.  Dubbya was guarding when Rhaevith and i entered and ikilled cenn.  Dubbya then logged off and logged onto Agent and pked rhaevith for coming with me.  Is this multiplay?  I dont want to be here to pk, i just want to be left alone but it appears none of me/my friends will be allowed to because cenn is targeting us for pk."
