__Letter "Hey baby, sorry I wasn't online today :( I was playing at a card shop and then right after that I went to the movies and saw Underworld 2 again because my friends that was with me hadn't seen it yet and they wanted to see it. I've missed you tons and I can't wait until I get to talk to you again. I miss your voice so much and just thinking about it makes my heart flutter. I tried asking your brother if you were near but it says he's idle so there's not much I can do there...I'd call but then again I don't want you getting in trouble either. But none the less I'll try to be on tomorrow sometime. I love you lots and I can't wait to hear from you, sorry again for not being online today. Good night Love.Yours forever and always,Josh"
