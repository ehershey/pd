__Letter "With combos and move predictability, you might be somewhat better off usingskills that the opponent doesn't have.  For example, if I slash someone whohas a huge amount of blade skill, they are much more likely to anticipate(and successfully deal with) another slash.  Whereas if I choke them andthey have no melee, another choke would be more difficult for them to dealwith than the slash.  In short, you may be unsuccessful using skills on anopponent who is an expert in those skills.For big, stupid monsters, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that theyget rocked by repeated use of the same attack, because they aren'tsophisticated enough to deal with it.I think the best part of the combo/attack prediction would be adding anelement of strategy to fighting.  People complain about monotony, well.. what if you had to pay attention to your enemy and learn their particularstrengths and weaknesses?I'm not sure exactly how this would apply to spells, but it should.  Maybeyour spirit/mind resists a series of identical attacks, if the mind/spiritis strong enough.Levi"
