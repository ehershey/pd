__Letter "I know that Loki's area is waiting to be fixed (because of all the typos), but I'm willing to go through the area myself, and fix the errors.My immortal on the builder's port is named Marduk, (I coded the Goblin Mines, so you know I have some experience, not like you need much to fix typos).Anything I can do to help, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.Dante/Marduk"
