__Letter "ok, venenum asked me for some input but gob wouldnt let me get on the comp last night so here goes..First off I think just copying bladedance and changing the name is kinda slack. And I understand vene just whipped it up outta nowhere and he probably didnt expect it to last Swashies need to be on par with mages rogues and fighters.. they're just lacking that 1 key ability that everyone else has (slash, backstab, area spells/magic armour)I got a few idea's i think would be coolFirst would be to just give us an ability equal to slash.. problem is, slash damage is based off of the attack skill which wanderers get almost none of for some reason.. what I think should happen would be for swashies to get another skill called \"Finesse\" I dont know how to balance it myself but i'm sure one of you doesSo add the skill and the new ability and make it so a fighter with attack and blade maxxed using slash does the same damage as a wanderer with blade, attack AND finesse maxxed.. I think it's only fair that swashies get the ability anyways, but requiring a whole other skill to max would make so you're not just giving them a great ability for nothinwe'd still have to train much harder than fighters to be equal to them, which is find because we're obviously not as strong as them physicallyfind = fineSo, maybe an ability called \"Flurry\" or \"Barrage\"you wouldnt get a double message for using two swords but you would get double damageMatrim gracefully spins behind you and slashes at your torso with a flurry of precise sword strikesYou spin around your opponent and slash at his back with a barrage of sword strikesI think this would be the best choice.. I dont see the logic behind someone who is MASTERFUL with a sword, not being able to fight as well as some big guy with muscles and a claymorein swordfighting, technique owns brute strength EVERY timeOr I had another idea that I think would be hella pimpThis move requires you to first use your trip ability.. as cool as it may be, I can assure you not a single swashbuckler uses trip.. mobs only sit for a half a round and anyone fighting a swashie can just set an alias to stand and completely avoid the attack every timeSo what I propose is an attack you can perform after you trip someone, to make it simple, if you trip someone, they're completely prone and vulnerable.. so maybe some kind of move where you basically stick your sword into thier gut while they're tripped.. it would have to be used during the same round that the person was tripped, or else it would be easily avoidedIMO it should be a really high damage dealing move, maybe equivalent to a tri-slash from a raknidbut since it will be dealing so much damage it would need a drawback.. a saving throw, that is not affected by your lvl, skills or anything, just a random, small percentage where if you fail the attack is blocked and you're unable to use an ability the next roundit would look something like this<trip monster>You spin around blah blah landing your opponent with a thud<pierce opponent>As your opponent falls to the ground you follow through and plunge your sword into your opponents gut, spilling thier inards across the roomIf you fail you could get a message like thisYour opponent rolls out of the way of your strike and your sword is buried into the ground underneath him.then the next round..In a feat of strength you pull your sword from the ground and compose yourselfalso, i am totally for this, and I know vene is toowe have ships in this gamethose ships can be equipped with cannons, that you can use to attack people ships and potentially pk themso that means in this world, gunpowder existssooo in a world where pirates have ships and cannons they should MOST DEFINATELY have a pistolthere's two things that you could do with guns.Either add a weapon skill that only swashies get and make actual gun weapons.. this tho, would require adding 4 or 5 abilities to go along with it, just to make it worth itwhich is kinda gay and tediousORyou could make  the gunshot an opening move, that deals good damage and can give several status effects of low low percentage, things like para, poison things like thatAnother cool thing, instead of using the disarm ability, you could just give swashies a random chance to disarm people at randomthis, of course would require having attack, blade and the skill \"finesse\" i suggested all maxed outLemme know what ya think, i'm sure I could come up with plenty of more ideasMatrim the Pirate"
