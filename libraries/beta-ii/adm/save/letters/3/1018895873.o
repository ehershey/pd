__Letter "Dear Wisp,   Aww, forgive me. I didn't know you wanted mail from someone If that's the issue, then mail you shall get! I want to thank you again for the pictures you've been sending me Heh, I am downloading them now, they filled my mailbox. :) So it'll be all good here in a minute. Why'd you have to get offline so fast last night? I missed ya and didn't get a chance to say goodnight. Anyway.. I'm being poked fun of on the mud so I gotta run. See ya later.Cookie"
