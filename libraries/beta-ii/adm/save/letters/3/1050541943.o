__Letter "I don't know if you've been up yet, but I got on much later today than i usually do. My dad was busy doing camera stuff. And now i can take pictures and everything. ;)So it's almost 7 now, i'm gonna go play around with some pictures and be back in about 30 mins-1hr. Hope to see you then. ;)Love,Heather"
