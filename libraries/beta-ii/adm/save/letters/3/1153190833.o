__Letter "The west side of Belief Trail is full of life and excitement. Many races gather around to find the right shops to make their purchases. The smell of baked goods wafts through the breeze inviting all to find out where the delectable smell is coming from. To the east the Sky Temple square can be found. The clouds lay softly along the roads path, allowing passerbys to comfortably walk towards their destination. Facing north, there is a sign on the side of a building that reads 'The Cathedral Vineyard'. To the south, there is a small path that offers anyone a seat after a long day. Birds fly around, taking in a beautiful day. The clouds gather slightly the more west the path leads on Belief Trail. Facing south, there is a sign on the side of a building that reads 'The Cathedral Drink Shop'. To the north, the sound of dragons can be heard. A few plants can be seen magically growing through a tuft of clouds.The more west the Trail leads, the more warm and crisp the air feels. The clouds seem to be gathering, making the road move uphill. Facing north, there is a sign on the side of a building that reads 'The Cathedral Bakery'. To the south, the sound of cheering and screaming can be heard.   More and more, the Trail leads moves uphill, allowing the air to feel more fantastic. Facing south, there is a sign on the side of a building that reads 'The Cathedral Restaurant'. To the north, strange lights can be seen flashing. A slight breeze flows along the trail.     The path along Belief Trail ends at the base of a small clouded cliff. A beam of sunlight shines brightly through the clouds, providing enough light to see. Many Angels and god-like people climb up the hill after stopping shortly to speak to one another. A few plants can be seen magically growing through a tuft of clouds. A sunray shines brightly through the break in the clouds towards the east, allowing the room to be bathed in sunlight. The white fluffy clouds offer unnatural support for all who tread on them, and remain as beautiful as they once were, like a fresh new powder of snow. The square has become quite busy, as the hustle and bustle of the town grows. The water in the fountain makes a soft trickling noise. This is the room where adventurers come to share their stories about their conquests. There is a board lying in the middle of the room with clips of stories and words for all to read. A beam of sunlight shines through the clouds providing enough light to see. The clouds, in their beauty, offer a soft cushion for travelers. "
