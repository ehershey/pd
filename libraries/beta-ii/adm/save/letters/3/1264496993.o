__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Tauran to Daos Sun Aug 29 17:22:34 2004:----------Original letter sent by Venenum to Tauran Sun Aug 29 10:20:30 2004:-----Your pick of the reward for your bug reporting is as follows: Pick ONE: 1: 30,000 gold coins 2: Cloak of the Reaper - Once per reboot, allows you to disintergrate any mob instantly (for zero exp) and be fully healed. This restores removed limbs. A line will be added to your look and the item will be generally cool. 3: Silver Whistle - Once a reboot, this item can be blown, summoning all your party members instantly to the room you're in. This does not function in safe zones, non-magic rooms, nor will it teleport those who exist in such zones. If you choose either of the items, they will instantly disintergrate if touched by anyone but you. If you loose them for any reason, they will not be restored, they are one-off items. They will also have a (very small) chance of breaking with each use. All items will autoload for you, may not be auctioned and may not be stored. Other features or bad things may exist at my discretion."
