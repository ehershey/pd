__Letter "I understand what you are getting at, I knew at the time. Most people do not get me at first, I too have been playing muds since about 1992 and wehn I came to PD I always promised myself I would not be one of the dick admins I put up with when I was a player. I am interested in your opinions, your thoughts, and everything else you want to say about PD. If I seemed like I was giving you a hard time, it was meant more as a joke then to be a dick or aloof or whatever other admins act like. There is a way to get feedback about when you train skills, try typing notify skills and when a skill levels up it will tell you. I really need to look into a way to have that turned on for new players by default. As for trainers and such, I will definately give it thought. We listen to anyone and everyones ideas here. We try to make them work in a way that is good for this game and if we can't we apologize and try something else that will hopefully get the same result. I do hope I have not offended youm the way I acted. It was not my intent that you did not have a valid point or that WoW ideas do not belong here. I have been a bit off do to some insomnia problems and without much sleep the past month I find I am moody at times. Anyhow, try out notify skills and let me know if that was part of what you were talking about. As for coding/building we are always insterested in people contributing to the mud, next time you see me we can discuss it :)Stormy"
