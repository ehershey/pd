__Letter "Well a whole big ordeal happened tonight while you were at uni. Best I can explain it to you right now is just to read over illum board. But, there's a quote i reproduced over illuminati line that I would like for you to save and log for me if you still have it (i assume you do). It's Bellos' quote about what agent said, directly from the ethereal guild line. Also if you could please log anything else you think is important, but I think I got most of that stuff stated in the posts on teh board.Thanks honey :) I'll let you know if I need those logs.*kiss*"
