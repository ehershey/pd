__Letter "well, dane needs a new video card, no question about that part, the old one has passed on to where all good computer parts go, just not all the way to the trash can yet :Pbut dane figures he'll need a new motherboard soon, because its as old as the video card, so it will cark it soon enough. and he needs a stick of 256 RAM, because one of the two died a while ago, and his poor comp has been running on only 256RAM :P the horror :Pbut yeah, the video card dane had was a Raedon 8500 original, and his motherboard is a 4XAGP, so anything which runs at 8XAGP is going to be sloooow. hope that helps david. thanks for the help if you can give it, and thanks anyway if you can't.Carmen: oh and btw, are you still on the ship? can you email ash at kalyka@hotmail.com and let her know if you want to stay on or not? i dunno if she's emailed you, she said she would, but yeah, she wanted to know. thats all for now :)Carmen and Dane."
