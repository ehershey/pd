__Letter "so you said you're back and yet i see now stormy on!!!well i wouldn't even bring this up again b/c i'm sure it is annoying the bageebers out of ya, but i saw people asking out things for guilds and changes for guilds and etc etc, and thought I would bring myself up again!  It's been awhile since we've talked about it, and I'm sure since you even thought about it.  While you were away, I've started to put together a guild town, the one i told you about before you left for awhile.  I figured if you saw it, you could decide better.  I would love to join the Immortal team and help make guilds more interesting and yet balanced.  Please let me know.  Thanks hun.Carina/Samantha"
