__Letter "I must apollogize stormbringer. I did not read the rules that closely.I didn't realize that it was against the rules to interact with players on the same IP.I admit i did it cause it was a friend of mine playing in the same computer lab as me. Again i appologize to you and it won't happen again. It wasn't a multi-play just someone else in my computer lab that wanted to try out the game.IronmanP.S. -- If i gotta take lumps for it i would understand."
