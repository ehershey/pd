__Letter "She has expressed an interest in being a guild immortal.  Guilds are currently on hold because there is no immortal to take them over.  I think she can fulfill this role, but does need to expand her knowledge of coding.  She has been working towards this though by learning how to code spells and more advanced objects with help from Nulvect.  She is creating another area called the Sky Temple which will be followed up with Neverland and Raknid Layers.      Nulvect has used several of her ideas for subclasses and has considered other ideas such as the spell deathgrip which may be added.  Carina has initiative and a creative mind that is hard to find in people.  She also learns from her mistakes and is not afraid to ask questions when she is unsure of something.      The last time that she was considered for an immortal, the problem was that her personality clashed with the mud.  Since then, she has matured and become a stronger person.  She is not the same Carina that we knew a couple months ago.I'm not the only one who recommends Carina.  I hope you consider her to be part of the staff."
