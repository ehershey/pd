__Letter "Ok, I was in a room, fighting and I hit \"kill all\" right after my friend walked in, and he was weak enough that I basicly gibbed him in about 1 round. Now, I got a record, and it was total accident, my sword even para'd him out of luck so he couldn't run. Anything you can do? If not, it' all good I guess... but since it was total accident, I figured I would see if there was anythign that could be done. Thanks.Ryan"
