__Letter "I think to escape a battle you should have to 'flee' instead of just leaving the area.  And fleeing would work randomly based on level versus level.  For example, a level 100 would have little difficulty running from a level 1, but a level 1 would have much difficulty running from a level 100. I suggest this because it really sucks when you try to kill someone and they can escape the battle 99.9% of the time.  I think it should be harder to get away from someone.Sent this idea to Stormy, too.Levi"
