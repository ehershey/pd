__Letter "I am told that you and forsaken are saying I have to give your diamons back or else.Naturally that is not going to happen.However I will sell you them back at 3 million gold each if you wish.Also if you PK plague and one of the leaders of my guild can confirm that he was killed, I will give you 5 diamonds.Booting Plague from Forsaken will get you 2 diamonds.-- Vyce"
