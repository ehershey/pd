__Letter "I thank you for your loyalty and support, we are in great need for these things in the guild, it is my hope that one day it will be as full of such traits as it once was, before most unfortunate events caused the destruction for the most part of our guild, i trust you know of who and what i speak of.Carina and I hope to go on sharing the role of leader for as long as possible, it is of great importance to have some sort of active authority online as oftern as possible and as much as i would like to it is just not possible for me to be here enough. I have great confidence in this system, it has been working sofar and i hope it will continue to work in time to come.I will do what i can to weave whispers wherever they may be picked upon, even as quite as it is at the moment one never knows what mischief they can get up to in the dark and quiet....Again thankyou for your support and loyalty, i have no doubt it will be of great usefulness in times to come..Till we speak again..Paranoia - Keeper of The Light."
