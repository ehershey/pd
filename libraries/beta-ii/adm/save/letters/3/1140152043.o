__Letter "Hey Rayna, I know I said I'd be here in an hour but I'm tired and I think I'm going to go ahead and go to bed, I'll be sure to talk to you tomorrow though and it was nice talking to you on the mic today. *grins and blushes* Thank you for saying I have a sexy voice, but your voice is sexier, hehe :). But none the less bye for now and I hope you have sweet dreams...oh and I'll purr for you the next time I see you on....but I'm going to stay on till the time I said to meet you and if I don't see you around 9 your time then I'll go ahead and leave...*waves and hugs*"
