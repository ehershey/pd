__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Lucifer to Faust Wed Mar 13 03:56:52 2002:-----here it is......Message 59 by Ashram: treatyI'd say no to that treaty with the forsaken100k gold + 10k per member is nothing... 200k a month? i'd pay 200k gold amonth just to keep them out of a treaty :PI dont want to have people like lucifer running around and not being able tokill them. When pk opens i will be paying 100k gold to have certain peoplekilled. If they want protection i suggest making it an individual thing andmuch more expensive. Along the lines of 300k gold for a week's worth ofprotection.But dont let a whole guild into the treaty... too many annoying people who needkilling-- Ashram the Black KnightMessage 60 by Ashram: pkOk. When PK opens there are some people i would like to see dead. I'll pay 100kgold for their deathsHere's some of them off of the top of my head:ArtanisLokiAziraphaleGabrielLuciferI want any special weapons they have taken as well. An extra 25k per auctionitem i recieve, and an extra 10k for each starscream.Live and let die.-- AshramWTF is going on?"
