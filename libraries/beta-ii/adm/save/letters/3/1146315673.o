__Letter "i'm sure you were just waiting for me to mail you about thisyes i believe carina would be great for this she is dedicated to her coding just as much as she is to this mudand you know she won't take no ones crap she tells it like it is unless we are running a guild with each other then she just tells me and i get them when i see them lol... but yes i think you would be crazy if you turn her away from this chance i believe she will do great workanother thing i know this is a long shot but i'm trying i'm soo trying to be on more and maybe once i get in my new place i will be on more i would like to try it out sometime but i know with my absents that is dinging me hard right there but i would like a chance and maybe not till i'm back on all the timethe opportunity that i could like to try to see the administration roll vs. play roll i know you guys do hella work and i know it's not easy i know i haven't done any real coding but samantha is a great teacher and she knows how i learn i just wanted to ask and i will fully understand if i'm turn down. but yes i stand by what i have said earlier you would be crazy to turn her down thanks for hearing meStacey"
