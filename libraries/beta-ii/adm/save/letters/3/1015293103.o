__Letter "i'm not sure i'm going to be around on Tuesday. my scatterbrained friend Celeste decided to call a roleplaying/anime festival, and somehow i ended up being the host. *smirk* i don't know how it happened... but that's the gist of it. I will PROBABLY be on sometime Tuesday, but probably not until later on. I'm sorry about that, i really need to go hunting and xp the crap outta Azire. anyway.. *wink* seeya"
