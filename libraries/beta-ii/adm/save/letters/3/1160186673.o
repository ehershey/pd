__Letter "dont think you care, but im going to say it anywaysthis is a game, a simple game that brings nothing advantegous to anybody, purely for fun, when in said game, two people who used to be pretty cool with each other develop a hate for the other, its really sad. dont know if you feel the same way, but when you played sira and when you started rohl, i thought me and you were friends, and you obviously dont feel the same about me, id like to still be a friend, ruining a friendship over something as stupid as pd is absoultely pointless, no this is not a mail trying to get me back into darksoul, since if you really do hate my guts it wouldnt make a difference anyways. but if youve read this thus far im guessing that means your even the tad bit interested in what i have to say. all ive got to say, is if we could put this stupid shit behind us and still tolerate one another. i know i can be annoying, hell, everybody is annoying at times, and im just gonna use everybody elses reason for blaming it on, im 15, im in high school, and since you claim that every single person in the guild feels the same utter hatred towards me as you, i doubt youve read this, and will even consider anything said thus far. but if by any chance you did, would be nice to get a response, any kind of response, fuck off, go to tell, choke and die, or hell, maybe if by some miracle, an \"ok geddoe i forgive you for being an annoying shit\", sorry for wasting your time if not"
