__Letter "Knights of Valor sounds familar but cant put my finger on it.  Let me know if you figure it out :pA KOV member should be the first to help a newbie with eq, areas and tips.  Food/drinks would be purchasable to guild members but there would be no rule against sharing them with non members.Also, if you arent able to be an angel for that subclass you wouldnt be alowed in the guild.  Also id like to see about a barrier that searches the person's alignment and would not let them in if they were more evil then good..  Maybe a fountain of holy water blessed by John the Baptist(the irl man who baptised Jesus) that when drunk can purify your soul and make you saintly again over time of course.Tears from Heaven would be a guild oil, Crystal of Light(still thinking bout the name for this one) would be the type of magical stone, rubbing the crystal so the light can shine through more.  Would like to see \"Light Wings, Shield of Righteiousness, God's Hammer, a Cloak that would cover and protect the halo( prob just like the cloak of the midnite but for angels, Sword of Truth and Helm of Salvation  Just a few things i got from the top of my head, i had a few more but not sure if this is what you wantedYun"
