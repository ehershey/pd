__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Wraith to Aziraphale Thu Mar  7 07:40:13 2002:-----I dont know how long you have been playing this mud, but I do know Faust was here at the beginning of version one or soon therafter. He knows what he is doing and if he posts something like that on a public board, he has his reasons for doing so. Maybe its to warn other players, maybe its so he can have what was done to him out in the open, I do now know this yet. Let him rant and rave as he will in the meantime and ignore him otherwise."
