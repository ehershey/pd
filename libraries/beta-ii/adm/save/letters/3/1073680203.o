__Letter "Hey um... your probably gonna go \"hahahahahahhaa stfu no Endy\" at this but i guess its worth a shotregardless. Seeing that you don't really play anymore, offering you money to purchase the guild from you is probably futile, but its all i got... And i was wondering if you would like to perhaps get rid of your ownership of the guild... *shrug* I assume that our guild eq and such is not going to be put in for a long long time, if ever now... i wanna see the guild more active, cause its kinda suckage to be the only one on 85% of the time, drakule is about the only one i see on besides me (shiva dont count) ah well. with that, i say i love you ect. and i hope you do more than laugh at this... :P"
