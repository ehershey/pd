__Letter "Thanks guys. Not sure which of you two fixed my error but thanks.I'm going to insert the changes Stormbringer wanted to access intomy security system. It will work better there cause my system onlyaffects the user commands and their objects. When i built it, ipurposely exempted the mudlib from the screens like BuildSecure did.Ill main you two once the changes are done.Ironman"
