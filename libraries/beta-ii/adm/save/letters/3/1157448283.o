__Letter "goes to swashbucklers i'd love to see em improved and more popularit's a class with tons of potential, but with the risk of pk and high level of competition here they're kinda left in the dustthey should be just as strong pk wise as fighters and just as fast at xp'ingit's not like they're a class like gypsy or bard that may have to fight on occasion, these guys are pirates, thats all they do is plunderand they're good at it!"
