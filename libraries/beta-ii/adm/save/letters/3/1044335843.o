__Letter "I have heard of some odd things concerning players actions twards this character. Blue is Wisp's daughter and I hope she is treated with the same respect as would stormies kids.Some of the actions and things said to this character were not nessicarily wrong to say to a normal player, but to a child it could be insulting and it might offend the parents if they happen to play the game or see it on the screen. I dont want to hear about another situation where a parent has to come to an immortal because something was said to their child that the parent took as offensive. If I EVER have to hear anything of this nature again, the player who did it will be arrested or ridded."
