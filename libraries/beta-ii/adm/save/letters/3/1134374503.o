__Letter "With the changes to guilds, and the new member cap, I've gone through and purged as many people as I can. I'd love for you to stay, if you really want to, but it looks like you haven't been on for 2 weeks, and your spouse in game is in another guild.I was thinking if you've got a great friend in a different guild, you'd be better of in their guild, rather than ours."
