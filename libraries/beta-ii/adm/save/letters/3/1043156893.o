__Letter "I was wondering, it seems the players have alot of problems, and you being busy and all doesnt make it any easier for you to get this balance shit done.  So, I came up with this idea.All the immortals and admins will select 1 subclass to work on.  They will improve the abilities underpowered as well as those overpowered.  However, it will be sent through you to make sure it is ok since you are balance.  If the imms all took a subclass and worked on it, the players would be happy as well as you becauze it would get alot easier.  Even if you still had to look at the spells/abilities, I would think it would be alot easier to look than code it.Just one of my numerous ideas, WhitP.S.  It might get some of our imms active once again."
