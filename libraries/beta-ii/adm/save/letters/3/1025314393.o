__Letter "The armor is still Raknid armor. Have Stormfire fix it or something.But hey, thanks man. You made my day... The stuff that's happened today will blow your mindI died not once, not twice but four bloody timesBloody mumble...grumble... Ahem, it wasn't Lucifer or another demon, although he did stand outside the guild hall while I was in it for a while waiting for me to come outHe never did kill me, I've just had a baaaaaaaaadddddddddddddd dayAnyway I've went from level 26 to 34.5 in 8 solid hours of power XPing before I collapsed in bed and I should easily make it to level 35 soon.Ummm... In other news my grandfather had a heart attack... He and I don't get along very well (He's told me that he wished I had never been born) but still, he's family so I guess I feel something...Anyway, looking forward to partying with you and congrats on your strength. You can lift cars now, heheOh! One more thing. I saw luicfer smacking Drow archers (scry works really well when angels use it on demons) so he's getting stronger. But still only on half as much as we are. So I should be able to catch up with him in a few weeks and deliver a smack down so hard... ahem. I'm thinking about asking you to take dagmar along to para him, just to be sure.Anyway. Gotta XP. Seeya tonight, love-Nate the great"
