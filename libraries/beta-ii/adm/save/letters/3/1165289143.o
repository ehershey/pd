__Letter "just so you know, I know a lot of people on here can be a pain, me included.... but you ARE doing a great job, and your work is very much appreciated.  I'm sorry that sometimes people feel the need to be little pricks and complain and unfortunatly I don't think that will ever stop. But you are a great person, and you're kicking butt.  As far as I'm concerned, you're the best Imm on here.  And again, I personally feel that you should be an admin rather an imm.  Reguardless, you're doing great work and I thank you for that.Samantha"
