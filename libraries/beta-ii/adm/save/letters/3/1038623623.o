__Letter "  The Dragon      I got the idea for this article, when I was reading the Tirunboard. I had been sick for awhile, and when I returned, the board wasfilled with almost 30 posts about a certain dragon. Talking abouthow he is as some put it, annoying, childish, and immature. I believethat in some ways these things are true. Because if he really wanted tobe the bigger person in his \"situations\" he should ignore them, butinstead he persistently argues on a childish level about some of themmost idiot things I have ever heard. No, I do not think it is all hisfault, some people just don't have to patience to deal with people likethis certain dragon. But, these certain persons also argue with him. Most of these people are older, and if they are as mature as theysay they are, they should also ignore him. It may not be that easy, butit is possible. In my opinion this dragon can get annoying sometimes,but so does everyone, including myself. He is immature in some ways,and does have a strong childish nature to himself, which in some ways,gets very annoying. But, instead of getting totally annoyed and blowingup at him, you should remember the childish nature that has, most children are like that, and do not know when to stop. To return to myopening sentence, the board was filled with nearly 30 posts about him,most of them haveing a negative view to him, was in my opinion, alittleextreme. He is only one person, it is childish to let him have that much of an effect on you. He may be annoying and childish, but no person is worth getting that worked up over. To this certain dragon,I do not have just negative views toward you, and I apologize if I havehurt your feelings in any way.I changed the title because I thought the old one was mean. I don't know if I will be able to get an article in for Mocha or not, I got tonsilitus atm, and don't feel to good. But, if I feel better I'll try and get one in.Vampira."
