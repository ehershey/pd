__Letter "I just thought of something concerning demons and archangels. WHY THE HELL CAN'T WE FLY!!!. Haha, only joking :p. Seriously though, archangels and demons have wings, and I'm pretty sure they aren't little stumps compared to our bodies like on a blue dragon, and we aren't little midgets like the faeries, so I think we should be allowed to fly. Also, I think we've earned it, demons and archangels are quest races that you can only become onece you have already reached lvl 50, and then you have to go back to lvl 1 with no stats or skills. The dragons didn't even have to be elite first, in fact, the dragons had to be newbies from the beginning.Well, it's just an idea, which I think is a pretty good one since wings don't have any other purpose except to be mown by enemies since there is no good armour to wear. Oh, if you're wondering why I mailed you about this, errr, well.... I've talked to you before, so yeah :D.	- Demon Lord Artanis who is now n00b	- Aziraphale is still waiting ;)"
