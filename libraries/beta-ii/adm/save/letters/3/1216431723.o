__Letter "Sorry about the bronchial infection, love. I was up super late tryingto see ya. :) I got a lil couch sleep and came back. My monitor isstill busted, so I am reliant on the downstairs computer. They aren'ttoo fast on switching the downstairs computer to that big sweetnew hdtv. :D__. I think if I buy em the cordless mouse and keyboard,it might speed up the process. Anyway, I will try to be listening foryou in case between resting, you choose to visit. :) PLease getyour full rest and please get better soon. My heart is with you trying to get you better. An old family favorite is prune juice!\"When in doubt, crap it out!\" That was my dad's view on things,but just not so vulgar, hehe. I took it there. I will send this to acouple alts of yours to increase the chances of you reading it soon.Take care, sweet love.Your James"
