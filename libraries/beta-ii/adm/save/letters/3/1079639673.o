__Letter "Yeah, it was good to visit.  I'm also sorry for being a kinda crappy guest...  sometimes when I get anxious I start to get antisocial, which makes me more anxious and so on.  That happened yesterday morning during breakfast; the day before I was just really tired :P  Regardless, I enjoyed being able to see you and stay with you for a while ^_^  I'll be thinking of you *hug*"
