__Letter "Darkness envelopes the cave making travel difficult without a light source.  Travellers are left to grope about the cave with hands held out in front in hopes of feeling one of the jagged rocks or sharp drops before stumbling into a most unpleasant position.  Dripping water from deep within the cave gives an eerie atmosphere which is accented by the heavy moisture it causes.  The humidity supresses the traveller's senses, as if by placing some unseen burden on the already weary body.  The moldy, rotten smell of the cave has been known to turn even the most iron of stomachs.  Only the strongest of men survive a trespass into this cave.sugar"
