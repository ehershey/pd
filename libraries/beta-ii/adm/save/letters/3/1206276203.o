__Letter "OK, this is a little that I have learned about rage and maybe youmight find it helpful. :)1) Be careful about biting off more than you can chew.If you can kill it out of rage safely, you should be able to killit in rage. And rage fights the whole room. So be careful of areaswhere mobs roam, like the desert, unless yer super buff. :)2) Rage only takes 20 sp.You can kill a room full of foes for 20 sp, kinda a bargain. But atthe end, you will have 0. I eat some meat from a butchered corpseto get enough sp for the next room. If you find yourself a littleshort and getting stuffed, sleep for 5-10 seconds, then wake. Youshould have more than enough sp for rage. But be careful of thisstrategy after going hm. People are tricksy!3) Wield good weapons.Sounds simple, right? But if you have one weak weapon in the 2ndhand, you may end up doing specials that don't do as much damageover and over as rage randomizes your attacks. So, wield ya best!4) Rage can make you a murderer.This is at hm if some unsuspecting person walks in your room. It'sgood to get real buff as a mid, so that you can finish em off inthe event they start something walking in your room, heh.About all I can think of right now. If I think of more, I add more.Love,James"
