__Letter "Yeah, I'm pretty exhausted....  was up late last night working on homework and studying for 2 tests today.  I think I only got an hour or 2 of sleep.  Not quite sure, though.  Anyway....  I was just sittin around and figured I'd get a nap, but with it being almost 11, I might just fall asleep for the night.  I just wanted to let you know I've missed you and can hardly think about anything except getting to see you on monday ^_^  *hugs*             -Paul"
