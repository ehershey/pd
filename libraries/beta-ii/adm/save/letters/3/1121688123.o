__Letter "Hey there Girl.I got a massive message from Furiae to day, about whathappend Yesterday.Yes, I know i was angry, and i can see why you thought thatI had singled you out about it.I dont think that I ever actually attacked your selfor smokey over the whole deal.I was really really dissapointed in the fact that the Adminlet it happen. I'd like you to understand why.I went thought a lot with my dragon, I quested, and Ibattled hard right though to 50 with just annihlateall the time, I, along with wisp, wishful, and Smitetryed our asses off to get dragons looked at.Then, when after an extreemly long time, dragonsgot looked at and some got newspells. BAM.. every oneelse with a dragon alt started to play.I  was shattered that they couldnt find the time to helpbut would gladly mooch off so much hardwork"
