__Letter "I downloaded it...watched it...and that was one of the best movies I've seen in a while! I'm getting ready to download the second one. Also, don't forget to watch the new shippuden episode, it was freaking great I tell ya! Anyways, hope things are going well and also I wanted to let you know that I got to see the Naruto Movie with the Snow Princess in it :). Take care MJ! Call me whenever, because I dunno if I will be on here much, because when I download something it lags me very bad, so while the 2nd movie is downloading I may be watching t.v. or something. Anyways, sorry to ramble on! Take care!"
