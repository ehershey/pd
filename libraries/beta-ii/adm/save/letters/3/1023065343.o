__Letter "I know, it gets redundant, but thats pretty much all everyone hears from ya. I looked up your character and see that you have very low wis and int for your angel spells, and middling stuff for your attacks. maybe that is why your slash sucks compared to someone say gabriel and boffa. stats DO improve your overall attack damage, and with a stat total of only 250(which is what you had when I mailed you) you arent going to do very much damage for your level. maybe thats why it sucks so much?I dunno, its just my experience that the more stats you have the better off you are, combine that with maxxed skills for a lvl 51 and you should rule. But seriously, Ive heard comments about slash for 2 months now, \"it sucks, its great, it dosent do this much to this player when it does this much to this player\" mainly from you. I know this shoulds like me getting on your ass, but Im trying not to, and I am sorry if you are upset with this letter, just write me one and tell me what you think and what is so wrong with every spell/ability you have, even though I cant do anything about it I would really like to have your opinions on them.Sorry for makin you read all this.                       Wraith"
