__Letter "Need to ask you about a few issues1) I really need to have a way to reach the immortals without   logging onto \"ironman\" here on the game. It kinda negates   the fact that I am invisable to a builder and snooping if   i suspect them doing something illegal if i have to log on   here or use the \"pd\" line to reach the staff here. I would   like a line between PD-main and PD-builders that is just for   the Administrators on PD-builders and the immortals on PD-main.   This would solve the problem, cause quite frankly i sometimes   need to run what im seeing past the staff to know if it   warrents yanking the builder's plug, aka arrest/rid them.2) I am debating about 2 new commands, _mvdir.c and _cpdir.c   I should have them coded pretty soon but want to know if   you would want the builders to have such a potent tool.   **Don't want some noobie builder to make their entire     directory go POOF :P **3) I was also debating about a projector system for builders.   Think of it as a reverse snoop system. It would work as   follows;         a) Builder_A types %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^project add <builder_B>%^RESET%^            This adds the second builder to an array contained            inside of /std/user/history.c to keep track of who            Builder_A wishs to allow to see their entry history,            since it is history.c that contains it :P         b) Builder_B types %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^projector recieve <Builder_A>%^RESET%^            IF builder_b is contained in the array on builder_a,            builder_a will be prompted if they wish to allow the            projection to take place. IF they are NOT on the builders            list, then builder_a is told and the projection denied.         c) This command would have 3 syntaxs                   projector add <builder>                               This is the first granting of access.                               As I stated above, A second confirmation                               would take place before it is actually                               allowed. If the person is not on the list                               it will be flatly DENIED.                               Yes, I will be making the command's                               funtions \"static\" so ONLY the command                               and history.c can access them, no calls                               allowed :P                   projector remove <builder>                                This removed the person from the builder's                               list of approved recievers.                   projector list                               This shows the person his list of appoved                               recievers. I will also code it so there is                               and archp() or admp() test in there to all                               and archp() or admp() test in there to allow                               archs and/or adms to check."
