__Letter "The guild has pk'd people simply for joining other guilds - Simply to say that you don't betray your chosen guild.It is extremely wrong to post something for a person in another guild. We didn't just come here to chat, we were playing the game with this guild.You may want to inform Tsuke that Illuminati was never about killing the evil players, especially since the orignal leader was a demon necromancer, then demon kataan. We've always had demons and evil players in the guild. Also tell him that the guild was originally set up to be 'elitist' - the very premise of the Illuminati is to be the driving force behind the world. We did what we set out to do, and that is to be the most powerful guild in the mud.On the subject of cheating - that is in the hands of the admins. I am not sure where he got that getting off lightly thing, but Nightshade did remove that 600 million experience. Also, why didn't Tsuke ever actually say something in all that time?I don't understand what he means by the guild being full of power hungry players, as there are only a few that really play now.Oh, while we are voicing all our grievances, maybe you could also pass this on to Tsuke/Helena - Why didn't I ever get my character Prator back after Stormbringer siad to me that he would re-instate it. Or get my proper imm status, before I played Aziraphale, when I completed my area. He isn't the only one that has been 'let-down' by others here.Oh yeah, removed for posting for a character in another guild, and leaking info."
