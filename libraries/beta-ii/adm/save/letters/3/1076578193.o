__Letter "hey, i think i made a mistake on how much i'm supposed to get from selling all the eq i get. i just emptied 6 and made a little over 70k gold. i'm sorry. i know 10k isn't very much, but i feel kinda bad that i gave you a bad number, so what should i do with this extra 10k? any place i can donate it to?-jen"
