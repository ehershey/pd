I'm tired of his arrogance and just because some of theadmins swing off his balls doesn't mean that I do.Whit <cre> Dont talk to himWhit <cre> Easy as thatHermes <cre> His stupid suggestions must be responded to. If he ever comes upwith something that isn't incredibly dumb then I might give him more credit.Hermes <cre> But demanding we change the mud so he doesn't have to change is100 room area is about as arrogant as you can getWhit <cre> Unfortunatly, muds are full of stupid people.  But, the \"workers,builders, administrators\" have to tolerate them, and not go around downgradingplayers on public linesHermes <cre> I don't.  He's not a player.  He's a dumbshit.  But anyway, go tobed.Talking about Leviathas btw.WhitP.S.This all started because of:  <newbie> Hermes slaps leviathas like the moron he is.Then leviathas threatened to harass him.Wave"
