__Letter "hey yeah it has been a while :P hows it goin? I should be online a fair bit more than normal now I moved house last week and we have an adsl connection here.. it would be nice to catch up lots of things have happened in my life since we last talked. Become independent, been fucked around by a few women, moved house, thats all i can think of right now but im hungover and tired and stuff. Anyways ya it'd be real nice to catch up again. Hopefully I'll see you online sometime. I can't ring std's from this phone though so yah."
