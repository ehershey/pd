__Letter "Dude, it was not just the glass thing, that I was willing to forgive, it was not just emptying their treasury, had no problem since he returned it. My problem was even after being caight he went linkdead in the hall so he could come one later and jump more members. All three combined made my descision. You can get a markable item for your guild, but it will not return you to your guild, theirs no longer does either. no item or command will allow to to gate straight to your guild hall. I am just not allowing it, probably cause I am a dick or something.Just so you know, I consider Ashram part of the staff, no other player has tried to help as much as he does. It was not a hastey thing either, I was not mad or upset when I ridded him. I thought it over for a couple of hours before doing it and even now I too have reservations about it and may restore him sometime in the future, but I tire of re explaining myself to everyone, you are the 4th or 5th person to ask about this and funny thing is, Ashram has not asked me once nor wanted to talk about it. That tells me one of two things, either he agrees with it, r he does not want anything to do with me. And since he has sent me tells since the rid telling me about some other unbalanced stuff, I conclude it is he probably agrees with the punishment. Also, you know, as well as I do, almost every other mud out there would have rid and banished him for it. I have to start somewhere to stop the bug abuse ans rule bending that has been going on and this one put me over the top. I would have done it to anyone else as well, probably quicker than I did it to Ash.Note: the final straw was that he did not report it to me or tell me what he had done, and he always tells me when he finds things like this...That and he told someone not to post about it because he would get in trouble, wich tells me he knew he was abusing a bug.Stormy"
