__Letter "rofl, when i read that post i saw a long one, and i saw a list of numbernow, of course, since i have the lines going all the way without having to hit enter for \"more\" i didnt see who it was from.Again, of course, i read the bottom number first, \"50-Start the conversation by reciting today's date and saying,\"This may be my last entry.\" \"Now, my reasonable assumption is that it is from stormy with a header of \"things to do to get dested\" because yesterday some kid was threatening suicide againI found it quite funny when i found out who it was actually from and what it was actualy aboutanyway, \" 35-Tell them to double check to make sure your pizza is, in fact, dead \" is the funniest for me, i think i will try that sometimethanksbye"
