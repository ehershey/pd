__Letter "I understand your desire to keep a low profile. I got no problemswith that. :) I am going out of town tomorrow and will be gonetil Thursday. I'll be in Tennessee visiting Capt. Curious. :)At any rate, I will pop on here and there but not try to be too wrapped up in mud during my visit. I will mail you soon!Esco"
