__Letter "Not sure when you'll be calling and if I'll be alone, I figured I would send you this mudmail just to let you know the scoop.  First, sorry I didn't answer the phone.  I was basically being given the riot act and given my \"instructions\" on what I am or am not allowed to do.  I did stand up for myself to a point.  He didn't want anyone calling here but told him what he could do with that.  Just about everything else I've done okay but its stressful to the max.  I truly can't wait to get my own place and I'm working deligently on just that even though he's trying to set my plans on his agenda.  NOT!  Anyway, I hope you get a good nights sleep and I look forward to talking to you soon.Pam"
