__Letter "I read your mail... it brought me to tears. You always know the right things to say and at the right times.Tonight has been pretty bad, and nobody has been around to talk to... I guess I'll get over it.Class early tomorrow.. was really really hoping I'd see you, but I've gotta head to bed.Love, Jen"
