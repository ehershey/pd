__Letter "Post number 2 by Petrarch...\"re: A State of Merentha\"  \\`--------------------------------------------------------------------------It may not come as a shock, but the admins have lost their passion in allthat is and was Merentha.  Sure, at one point in our lives it was bigger,more exciting.  But as time goes on people change, their priorities mature;and to such happenings no excuses are needed, no apology will be offered.Merentha is still dear to us, that is why we keep it online, but it willnever again be that thing which consumes our souls.Merentha, as you remember it, existed because there were those who sawsomething missing.  Maybe it was something missing in the MUD community,maybe something missing from our lives.  Whatever it was, we built Merenthato fill that void.  And never have we prevented those who also sawsomething missing try to fill theirs for themselves.  Many have tried toduplicate our success.... all have failed.  I believed those who havefailed, failed because they were building a game, where we built a dream, adream which could not have been told without those willing to believe it.If what Merentha is today no longer that which haunts your night, thenperhaps you too have grown, and to that no explinations is required, but tothat, our congratulations are given._Petrarch-eof-LOL?"
