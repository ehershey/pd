__Letter "that subject good enough for ya? :POk, so what i'm thinking is really simple, and it makes total sense. I think we should have various 'sheaths' coded for all types of weapons in the game. Swords could have sheaths or scabbards, axes could have harness, spears could have baldrics, I mean there's a lot of really cool ideas that could be thought up, i'm sure. I'd be more than happy to help you think of all the items, all of thier descriptions and messages.It would be pretty simple to code I think, it's a type of sack that can only hold certain items <i.e. swords> and it can only hold one at a time, then you just change the desc and the messages you see when you \"put\" or \"sheath\" your swordthe commands would be <sheath (weapon)> and <draw (weapon)> you could make really cool sheathe and draw messages for them as well, I think would would add a lot of positive elements to the game.Also I think it's about time we saw some melee weapons in the game. I am very VERY interested in coding a whole area. We could start them off by putting them on a mob I create once i'm done with my area. There's all kinds of weapons we could make as melee weapons, brass knuckles, spiked knuckles, katars,  spiked gauntlets, battle gloves, padded gloves, all kinds of crap.I dont think there's any real need to make the damage they do in your idle rounds any better UNLESS the weapon specials.. thats the whole point of melee weapons really, JUST to special every once in a while.. I mean there arent a lot of people that are gonna use them anyways, only fighters and monks really, you dont need to add a new weapon skill cuz we already have melee skilli'm sure you could figure it out easier than I can explain it, so please just consider working on them, maybe make a default pair, show it to stormbringer and tell him you think they should be added to the game permanentlyWe need melee weapons daos :)!"
