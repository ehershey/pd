__Letter "Was just thinking about you. Wondered how your weekend was going.I don't know if you've seen Meet The Parents, but I just saw Meet the Fockers, and it was hilarious. :)I'm thinking of redoing my bathroom motif. Right now, it's a sun/stars kind of thing (not navy blue, but an almost periwinkle base, with darker blues, purples, and so on).I've had it for a couple of years (One thing about living in apartments for nearly 13 years - I've learned to keep my decorating accents mobile *grin*I saw some towels I really liked... Almost a burnished silver-green color. Not tacky puce, or anything. Unfortunately, no washcloths *boooooo*, well, and no real curtain to go with it. bah bah bah. :)Did my taxes last night, and I don't owe, which is good :) I even get a bit back. I've decided that's all going in my savings account, except enough to buy a painting I've wanted for about five months now. I'm not sure why I like it so much, but I do. It's an abstract by a Chinese gentleman, and I've gotten them to ship it here. When it arrives (about 2 weeks), I'll take a picture, if you'd like to see it?Myrddhin (Christiaan) has developed a lot of film from his vacation with Ellen, and has some wonderful b/w photos. I've asked for more to be sent to little ol' me, to add to my walls. I've been thinking that the abstract will go either in the kitchen, or maybe in the bathroom. It's a lot of primary colors (more red than anything, then yellow / blue), so I'm not sure. I've tried to keep the bathroom lighter, so it doesn't look so small (It's not huge, but really dark bathrooms always look small)I've also considered taking a plunge and getting a futon couch. It's hard watching tv from the day bed (it's up high, and the angles are really weird)... I haven't done anything yet. Still thinking.I love this place. I guess it feels weird to think this, but it feels like my first REAL place after the divorce. The place I was in behind the hotel was furnished, and I'd always been told that it was only temporary (and, face it, I hated the way it looked. NOTHING in it was /me/ - I mean cabbage roses? GMAFB [That's \"Give Me A F'in Break\", for those of you at home])I used my Christmas Gift Certificates to get a couple of books I've wanted for quite some time - Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (this is ... well... kind of a Harry Potter for adults), and the latest Robert Asprin book (Very light, fun reading). Mother sent money through PayPal, so I got a 75th Anniversary Better Homes & Gardens cookbook (I always remembered cooking out of one of those as a kid, with the 3-ring binder, and great indexes), and an autographed copy of a British author I like a lot, Mil Millington.Mil's got a page called \"Things My Girlfriend And I Argue About\", and after a few years of writing short stories on that theme, has written a few books now. He still sends a newsletter out to those who'd read the site from its inception (I've been on the list for several years now), and we've corresponded a few times. So, I ordered a copy off of the newspaper's site (they sell for the various authors who write articles for them, while pimping books at the same time), and he wrote me a few times, to see exactly what I wanted it to say. Other than getting my name correct, and not telling me Americans are stinky gits, I said the sky's the limit. He chose to joke about \"cockles\" (they're a kind of clam thing), since I had no clue what that was when he mentioned it once.Wow... Looks like I've written my own book. Sorry if I've just driveled on. Seems like we haven't spoken in forever.I have MSN on, and have no plans to shut Galadriel off tonight (Lappy is taking a nap tonight) - No, STOP LAUGHING! I HAVE to name my computers! THEY MAKE ME!Poor me. Always laughing at me!We're supposed to get quite a snowfall tonight/tomorrow. Should be interesting. I've finished my raspberry hot chocolate (there you go, snickering at me again! It's good, I tell you!), and now, I'm going to finish putting my laundry away (you'd REALLY laugh if I told you how many pair of black slacks I own.)I hope you're doing well, and smiling a bit, at least, over this. I'll speak to you soon.-H"
