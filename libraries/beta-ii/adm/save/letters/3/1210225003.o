__Letter "I'm still a little fuzzy on the new store system. You are planningfor the store contents to be saved over reboot, correct??And for guild leaders to be able to control (dynamically) whattheir guild stores sell?? And a second storefront for guilds tosell things to the public??We don't have a unified economy system right now, nor a code-enforcedpricing system (which might not be a good idea anyway).I think guild leaders being able to modify what their stores sellneeds to be monitored by the staff, as well... since someone could geta diamond and put that in, for example.Making storage rooms save over resets/reboot is fine, the onlyissue is if the storage room gets too full to look through easilywhen using the 'list' command.Could you break down the basics in just a paragraph or two??"
