__Letter "Day Two of my Xenia drought and no relief in sight. :( I went outand conquered Mark Twain then returned to find Xenia wasn't around.:( I decided to try my luck at work around the regular time. -----------------------------------------------------------------Dear Xenia, I am missing you very much. Your warm smile, yourtouching fur, the way you get all crazy when there's catniparound. I hope to bask in your presence soon and watch sunsetsagain on the bow of my ship.Loving you,Axenos"
