__Letter "hey stormy,draven here, well..i must say it was sad to see venenum go, he was doing great things for the mud..he was working on dragons..and i was talking to him pretty frequently about some things that could be worked on..like how fighters get 13 hp per con, venenum + hepastolele(spelling) + i were thinkin dragons should get more hp per con and maybe more hp per level too..i am not sure what number they were agreeing on..but they should get more then fighters..15 hp per con/level would be cool hehe..i mean dragons are huge afterall..another issue i was working on with venenum was..blue dragon breath, surely they are the most rare and mystical creatures in the game like the description says, ariel, valko, xeon, and smite are the only blues, and most don't have the patience to play one..they have the most potential with the high costs anyway..ven and i were working on tweaking the blue dragon breath and now hes gone..i was wondering if maybe i can talk to you about it, i know your busy and all..but try this on for size..(all 3 of us are lvl 50) set's got about the same wis as me, and his demonfire para's me every time. where as nulvect who has less wis never ever paras me..(in arena). now, set can break through my ice para but i can't break through his, when we spam..i think that the ice freeze shouldnt be able to broken through using spam stacking commands, and the demonfire para should be able to be broken through, like basically switch them around..cause the blue dragon breath should freeze..and demonfire should be able to be broken out of..i dunno if your following me so far....but also, i was discussing with venenum  how we could see blue breathe being the main ability..which is what i use xping, etc..and how it does so little hp/sp/mp damage. it steals hp/sp/mp as im sure your aware of..we were working on a way to make it deal more hp/sp/mp damage a round..cause right now i do about 120hp/sp/mp at level 50 with 98 wis, (ven wouldnt tell me what my breath is based on of course, and there is a possibility i might be mistaken on what exactly makes it stronger, but i played with it and found out that its mainly wis + attack + breath). if it could deal more hp/sp/mp damage it would be better..to the point where the sp/mp drain is useful so i could drain targets sp/mp and then dragon fury to finish their hp off ..but its not exactly useful..just yet..somethings missing, and i know dragon fury is based on almost everything stat+skill-wise and my dragon fury isnt all there yet..but the breath i'm pretty sure about.basically to sum this all up, 1) the dragon hp bonuses on level/con should be increased. 2) im hopin u can change blue dragon breathe to make the freeze unbreakable similar to kataans and well kataans para shouldnt be that good..also..(set was doing like 800 dmg + unbreakable para every round)..and 3) hopefully increase the damage of hp/sp/mp i'm dealing..it takes me 13-15 rounds to kill 36-40k mobs..while it would take my necro with same stats about 3-4 rounds..i been talkin with blits..he seems to feel the same way..dragons should be UBER..im not askin to be UBER..i just think i should do more hp/sp/mp dmg.well thats it lol, sorry its so long, i just wish i knew how to phrase all this stuff in a shorter mail..hope you get around to reading it. take care stormy.."
