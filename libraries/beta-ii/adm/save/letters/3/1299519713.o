__Letter "Ok, I added the login for tijirweb back in. The password was not what you said,so I reset it to that, though the shell complained that it was a bad password.The websites for numberonervpark and myliveweb were under separate logins...so I copied them into the tijirweb dir and changed the web server to look in thenew location. It is possible some things in those websites might have broken ifthey had hard-coded pathnames or were expecting to be owned by a certain useror something... not very likely, but just fyi."
