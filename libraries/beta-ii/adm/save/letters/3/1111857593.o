__Letter "Thanks for last night.  It was fun to say the least.  I'm glad you enjoyed it but for future info, you may want to find a safer room or take your boat sailing *winks*Also, thanks for your suggestion about going out and meeting someone.  The idea is good but for me, not possible.  Money and the ability to get around is a serious problem so I think I'll stick with another idea I had.  I spend so much time on the internet that I kind of hope that I'll meet someone mudding.  Who knows.  Maybe someone will come along that will actually like me enough to get to know me.  Phones are good and I can always go and meet them.  We might actually click.  Stranger things have happened.  But I just wanted to thank you anyway."
