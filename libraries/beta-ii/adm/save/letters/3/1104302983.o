__Letter "I'll be on a bit later I guess. I was making dinner and called Trev forupdate on trip. I guess he sensed something because I was telling himabout the net thing and he said even though they had told me to becareful as well, they tried to keep an open mind for me and were happy.I guess I was sounding down about it and Trev said it sounded like Ifelt my character was being attacked. I told him I knew it was going to behard for me too meeting your family when they had reservations.He knows me better than anyone in my family, since we're only 1 1/2years apart and he said he'd meet me for coffee after dinner, since Iwas concerned about it. I never professed to be anything than what I am and I am all that I sayI am. I know that on SM being called a slut and would sleep with anyone started it. That's why I went off there for awhile. I'm sure yourfamily were only thinking of you, but when I went on SM I didn't knowmany people and that was who I was and am. I've never spent muchtime on the net anyway (no chat rooms). I guess I feel like I'm defending myself again like I did on SM. I'll try and get back on again afterwards. Trev also wanted to let meknow about travel times/dates, so I need to vent again. I guess itseems like I'm defending myself more than I should have to. MaybeI'm just upset because once I met your family/friends, they'd knowme for who I am. I guess when you told me that, it hurt me a bit.I guess they don't realize that I am also scared and after my break-up,which happened before we got talking like we have been, that I was alsoworried about myself. So were some of my friends. I think in a way I feelscared, but I also got a sense of comfort from you. I never once doubtedanything, but I felt like I was on SM again. Sorry for venting, I just knowthat I thought people were okay with me, but when I meet your mum, therewould be that thought in my mind. I did tell my friends who had said similarstuff that I didn't want to hear any more about it and that someone had tobelieve there was good on the net. I think it's the same feeling like the personon SM was saying and I get defensive. Talk to you soon lov*hugs*Ray."
