__Letter "I know we dont really know each other but it seems that my makingthis character again has caused some problems. First and foremost,I would like you to know that I am not here because of Josh. I amonly here because I enjoy the game and the people. I also haveother characters here. If you feel that me being on as Rayna ishurtful to you and Josh, let me know. I will suicide Rayna and you won't have to worry. But, I want to assure you I have no desire to hurt you and Josh or be anything other than a friendto the two of you. Thanks for listeningRayna"
