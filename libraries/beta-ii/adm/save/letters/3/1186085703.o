__Letter "Yo man, I have an idea, you know how you were wanting Bone Clubs? Well, I'm going to remort Alexander before this next reboot, when the reboot is over I'll log back on as necro Alex, give you a shit load of bone clubs, and then remort back to thug >:), I'll do this for you anytime you want, so just be sure to ask/remind me of it. I remember you saying that you were wanting to remort esco into a necro for this, and I figured I'd do all I could to help. Take it easy MJ!"
