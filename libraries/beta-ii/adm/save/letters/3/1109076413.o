__Letter "Stormy,I know you don't really know me. I was Kabaal, -old- original wiz who didn't last long. If possible, I'd like to start helping to implement new things. I'd like to help with that Vampire quest if at all possible and also I'd like to help balance out dragons. If you have any use for me, mail me back. I have loads of ideas, but I've never been the strongest coder. I know Nightshade irl, though we live forever away now. I dunno, if you find a use for me let me know, I'll be here.Smokey"
