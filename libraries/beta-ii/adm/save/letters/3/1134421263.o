__Letter "A couple abilities for you to take a look at and check out:Chaoswave:   My level 30 (Myst) does about 300 with chaoswave in arena with his 20s in stats. Comparitivly Knuckle does 180 with gore with his much higher stats and non-room attack.Vortex:   From nulvect this does 700 to me (maxxed Magic Defense at lvl 56). I believe his wis is high but 700 area attack at lvl 50 is nuts. Thats as much damage as my old gore did, but it hits the whole room and takes mp which is easier to regen than sp.Just thought i'd let you know.Thanks,-- Vyce"
