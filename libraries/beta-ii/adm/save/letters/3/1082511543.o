Now, my strength is probably quadruple its constitution, like 120 points higher. The chance of stun not working would be so very, very small. If it could fail at all. Perhaps if you made it say that stun misses, then that would look ok.Anyway, point is that it is an opening only move, so it should be fairly reliable because you only get once chance. I thought it could work with something like:time = random(strength - op_con)/10;if(time == 5)time = 4+random(2);else if(time > 5)time = 4+random(3);if(time < 2)write(\"aha you missed etc.\");elseob->paralyze(time);So it makes a random number of 1/10th the difference of str vs con. If that is 5 it is random 4/5, if it is more than 5 then it is random 4/5/6. If the number is less than 2, then you miss the stun. They way it is set out, if a lvl50 went up to a spotted cheetah from lodos (lvl10ish mob), then he can miss his stun, but probably won't.I'm not 100% on how paralyze works, whether the number is in rounds or in seconds. If it is rounds then I'd probably go for these numbers since you need up to 60 more strength than their con, and it is random anyway. Otherwise just double the numbers.Note I made it fail if it lasts for both zero *and* one round, this is because if it is only going to last one round there is no real point to it, because I'm gonna get that round of idle attacks pretty much no matter what.ok, tis all."
