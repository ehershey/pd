__Letter "i'm am truly sorry if i was offensive, i didn't mean to, just i didn't think you knew/were listening to me thats all. but to me it looked like i was just being made worse, thats all, for me its hard enough to xp before then it got harder so you can see what where this is going.as for profanity on your lines daos told us we could swear on any line cept for newbie, so it sort of became no holes bard, if this was in relation to any thing else, well maybe i got carried awayanyway sounds like you know whats going on.umm just one more thing can you tell me approx. when paladins/angels will be worked on so i have an idea? i was just wondering thats all -Gabriel"
