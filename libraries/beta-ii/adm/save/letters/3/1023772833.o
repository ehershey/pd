__Letter "I am trying to get ed to log to a file whenever someone edits a file. I know it will fill fast and have redundant entries, But I need to track what the imms are doing since the mud has been down a couple of times lately do to file changes and I have no idea who is doing it. Anyhow, the logging is not working, could you take a look at it and see what I did or didn't do wrong?Thanks/Stormy"
