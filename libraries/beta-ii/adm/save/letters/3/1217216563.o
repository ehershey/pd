__Letter "I really am sorry about this hun, but after talking it over with Whit...well here's the message:I am sorry to tell you that Vorticon is on probation as a guild due to inactivity.  When giving you the guild, we asked that you build it up and have active members, and it didn't happen. You have until October 1st (2 months) to build your guild up again and have active members.  If by then the guild is still a \"dead\" guild, and is not growing, it will be closed.Amun"
