__Letter "So how's the mail system thing coming??I've been trying to catch you around lately, but been failing...I'm very seriously looking into more staff members on main port.It's obvious I need help. You're the next one in line, and I'm alsoconsidering one other person. At the moment I am waiting to hearback from Stormbringer, but as he and I have talked about bringingyou on before, I think it'll be a go.I'd like to have you work on major, long term projects, like thisnew mail system. You'd need to work in concert with me, Amun, andthe rest of the staff. If there are any questions or issues you haveregarding being an immortal on the main port, now is the time tovoice them. Otherwise I am planning to bring you on as soon asStormbringer OKs everything."
