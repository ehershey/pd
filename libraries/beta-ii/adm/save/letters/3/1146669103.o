__Letter "I was going to post this, but decided against it...I like Carina and all, and we get along pretty good.  And it's true that she actually has a couple of areas in the mud, which I can say is more than what I've done, Geez, I'm having a hard time wording this...As you'll soon know, I'm usually cloaked so when I come on I see people freely discuss topics, and though most of them tolerate her, they also can't stand her.  They think she is moody, and judgemental..which she can be at times but it is usually when she calls thier bluffI have mixed feelings about her becoming an imm, on one hand she'll expand the mud but on the other hand she may run some people off the mud.  So either way you will have my support.  I know this post is very sparatic, but it's 4 am and I really need to get my butt to workHep"
