__Letter "Ok, first off, hi. Now, down to buisness. I died in the swamps of merkirri... and I had wisp rez me, nobody knew where I died, and nobody was around me. When I got back there thanks to quick flying of wisp, all that was in the room was the meat in my backpack. I Lost SO much stuff! Everything I had just disapeared. I know I wasn't looted, I just lost everything... can you help me out in any way? I'll make another list of everything I lost, but I know I didn't get looted... it HAD to be a bug. Anyways... I gotta go work ont least getting something back... thanks... Ryan"
