__Letter "I have no idea how to help you. I know if your parents are like us, they want to see you do well, get out on your own and live life. Also, attitude has a lot to do with how we respond to our children. You may just need to set them down and talk to them about your anxieties and fears. Let them know where you are coming from and where you hope to be going. Remember, your parents are just like you, only older and more experienced in dealing with life and if they think you are not living up to you end, they should say so. I have never found any magice in dealing with kids or parents. My mother and I live about 40 miles apart and I may see and talk to her once a year. So any advice from a child perspective from me is not good. As for the parent perspective, all I can say is show them respoect when you are dealing with them, even when your mad or angry and it will go along way in helping them to see your side.Stormy"
