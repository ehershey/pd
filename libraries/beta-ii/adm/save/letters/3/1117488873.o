__Letter "just so you know, Asur and his alt Elendil (illisse's husband) are out of our guild.  As Asur he decided to be an ass and yell at furiae tell her that accidentally chaoswaving him was illegal and he will report her blah blah.  Saying that her sorry was not good enough.  So I told him that that is not illegal, he said Fuck you to me.  so I PKed him.  and he is out of our guild.  Just so you know."
