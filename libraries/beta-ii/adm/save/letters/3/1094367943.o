__Letter "Ok, that's cool.  I took a look at it earlier.  It kinda looks like you did it in watercolor...  what did you use to color it?  Sorry I got back on so late.  We've started playing a new RP system and it's working out really well.  It's more RP based and less rolling based.  It's something of a new version of vampire the masqaraude.  It's more of a setting with a separate vampire book...  but anyway, I'm starting to ramble.  From what I hear we'll be playing tomorrow, so between homework and everything I dont know when I'll be on.  I'll keep a sharp eye out for you though ;)  *hug*          -Paul"
