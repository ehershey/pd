__Letter "Just a reminder for you:I'd like to add a cleric to the illuminati guild hall. One that's just like the one in lodos that can regenerate limbs, cure poison, etc. I think it will probably go in the prayer room, and I'll get you description type stuff when you're ready. Thanks again, David! :D"
