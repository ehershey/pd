__Letter "I need your help once you log on. I sent mail to your PD account as wellbut i know your tied up with the new baby. Please look into this whenyou can.Awhile ago i auctioned an item (forget what it was) and someone bid like2b in gold on it. I didnt think much of it until later on since i rarelyxp. It was basically sitting in my accounts idle until i seen you to talkabout it. It was one of the things i wanted to discuss with you.Instead of approaching me and finding out the facts, Nulvect went aheadand wiped out my account and the DW accout. He claimed it was \"bug\" moneyand that the money was null and void.I had over 500k in my personal accounts and the DW had over 8m BEFORE thisinstance. I dont care about the 2b in gold. I was gonna turn that in wheni seen you. I do however want my original accounts restored. It's not gonnaaffect me much personally if my account is returned since im mainly a codernow but the guild needs it's account back.....TEchnically i gained the money by auctioning an item. I gained it legally.I'm not stupid enough to not realize it was out of the ordinary and waswaiting on you personally to check into WHERE that money came from so thebug (if there was one) got squashed. If person A used a bug to get moneyand then uses it to buy something from person B, then most of the characterswould have to be wiped......cause it has happened quite a few times.Please restore the dragon warriors account. Don't even worry about mypersonal account. I can take the hit.Ironman"
