__Letter "I kinda was talking to sugar civilly and I brought up that I talked to you about darksoul... I explained that I didn't care if I was a sex slave forever that I just wanted somewhere to rest and get strong with others, and contribute. But she intends to completely shut me out and I apparently can't be in a guild with her. So I guess this is a no-go :( sorry for your troubles"
