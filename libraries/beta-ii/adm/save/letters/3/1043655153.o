__Letter "REDIntense heat fills the area.The pathway follows the direction of the lava flow.Red forms flit and slip around like a mirage.Smoking red lava sluggishly flows through narrow channels.Low curving walls reflect light from many small jets of flame.Spires of hardened lava spew red hot embers.Steam from the lava mists over the path.The ground shifts with the flowing lava.Sheets of flame lick up the sides of the caverns walls.Water hisses and evaporates as it drips from the ceiling.A ball of fire shoots out of the lava.A bush along the pathway inites.Charred corpses litter the pathway.Pumice stone glitters along the walls.A roar echos out from the murky surroundings.Gusts of nearly overwhelming hot air blast out from somewhere ahead.Sulpheric gasses cause the air to waver.Crimson flames skitter across the path.The path is studded with bits of fossilized bones.Smooth cooled lava forms strange shapes in the cavern walls.BLUEWalls are worn down to a smooth sheen.Damp grey limestone curves and twists far back into the watery cavern.Dead and rotting fish are scattered across the path.Swirling pools of azure and blue rise and fall in natural basins.Green kelp sticks to a few of the walls.A small hermit crab crawls along the path.Light filters up from the pools of water, casting shifting blue patterns all around.Neatly carved symbols line the smooth walls.A deep singsong thrumming echos from farther within the cavern.Sand and bits of shell glitter from where they lay on the ground.Seasalt forms spindly webs on the surface of the cavern walls.The pathway curves around many deep basins of water.A small stream of water trickles down the wall.A form slips into a pool of blue water with a small kerplunk.Steam rises from the warm water.A cool breeze blows through the cave.The path slopes gently down, meandering nearer to the pools of water.Mud cakes the crevices and cracks on the path.Plant roots dangle from the ceiling.Water spills over onto the pathway , making footing a little precarious at times.FORESTThe forest is a dark and ominous place.The forest seems to be watching all that goes in inside it's depths.In this part of the forest, trees grow in thick clusters.The ground is scattered with fallen branches, and leaves.A green canopy of leaves nearly blocks out the sky.A growl off in the distance sends nearby animals scurrying through the underbrush.The lack of light down the path gives a distinct feeling of danger and trepidation.The darkness shrouds everything in shadow creating a sense of doom and despair.Dark shape move in the trees nearby.The sky cannot be seen due to the denseness of the forest canopy.Shadowy shapes hang above the path, reaching down like claws prepared to grasp   anything passing nearby.Creaking noises accompany the wind each time it blows.Shadowy forms out in the forest seem to creep closer to the path.There are many trees and shrubs around.The lush green leaves sparkle in the faint light.Trees are all around.There are many trees here that seem to have claw marks all over their trunks.The trees are eerily silent.The forest opens up into a grove of ancient elm trees. Whispers fill the air, seemingly coming from the trees themselves."
