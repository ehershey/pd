__Letter "Ok, so protect is gone, so now that I take huge amounts of damage I am back to facing problems I got to ignore.These are notes I came up with ages ago and just recently.1) Unless protect is going to be better than shield, don't bother fixing it, since you will be preventing defensive spells from stacking.2) Limits aren't good. Para can only last so long, that's ok since it paralyzes a player. But cure and shield. Shield can only last so long, and can only give so much ac, just as cure can only heal so much hp. The problem is that I am now pouring 35million exp into a level. Almost all my skills are over a mill a point now. If my spells aren't getting any better, ever, why level/train skills/improve stats?3) It's good, but the effort required to get it is just too much for what it is.4) Angel stats, elves have the same Intelligence as us? I don't think so. But you are fixing up stats later anyway.5) When I cast cure or peace, it delays my next casting of holyfire for 2 rounds rather than 1. This is something up with holyfire because absolutely no other spell is affected by it.6) Monsters get too good to quick. It takes me 7 hits with HF to kill a 60k mob, when I am level83 with 498 faith, 314 MA, 100 wis. 30k mobs I kill in 2 hits. Even when you take the xp cut into it it is still 60k/7 hits compared to 20k/2 hits. 8.5k/round compared to 10k/round. Now, factor in that I can take on 10 30k mobs at once with ease, but I get mown by 5 60k mobs. You see where I am going with this? Also, don't forget that I am 23 levels beyond a 60k mob, I am about to get exp cuts from them, and they mow me to the doomhouse. We end up getting cuts on mobs before we can even effectively fight them.Other stuff.If Gabriel, Drakule and I made level100 all at the same time, can we get a statue of all three of us together?I know this'll sound relaly dumb, but I wouldn't mind taking on little projects on builders to help out. Like if you need help getting bugs out of abils? If ability ideas get sent to you I could work on making the abils so you can test them, see if they are good. Maybe work on quests and things? A sky like the ocean for PD. I got ideas for things. I just can't devote all my online time since I do like to play.That's it. I look forward to you not sending a reply, since I know you don't do that ;) (jokes) - Prator"
