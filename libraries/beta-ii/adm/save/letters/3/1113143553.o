__Letter "Well, I was just on here for a bit.  I tried sending messages to all the screen names I know, including Waliing.  I hope you've been doing well.  You'd be proud of my assertiveness at work as of late.  I've been in charge and had to make some difficult decisions and stand up to people who no one else would.  It got me in a bit of trouble, but at least my point was felt and understood.  I have made some plans for a trip to Ohio on August and I'm gonna do a trip to Cedar Point!  I can't wait!  WOOHOO!!  Probably gonna do some camping in July before the trip out there.  I took Jazzy kite flying the other day and she loved it.  The wind was a bit much and I got myself a nice rope burn cause I didn't let the string go fast enough when the wind picked up.  You should have seen her holding the kite, it almost picked her up and took her away.  She doesn't even weigh 40 lbs, I don't think.  I took her to see Robots the other day and she loved that.  K, I guess I gotta take off.  I hope you were pleasantly surprised to have this mudmail sitting here, waiting on ya.  I miss you.  Someday I'll have you come out of my dreams and I'll see you in person.  Until then, I'll just sleep a lot :)          -Jesse"
