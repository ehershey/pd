__Letter "Venenum stands before you, his red scales glimmering in the light. A matured, adult red dragon, this creature could be a fearsome creature to draw swords with. What's the rule? Never fight anything with teeth bigger then your sword? Yeah, something like that. His underbelly is a lighter pinkish colour, whereas his back, tail, and other scales are a dark crimson. Eyes of a bright, reptilian yellow peer out at the world with an inquisitive but cautious outlook."
