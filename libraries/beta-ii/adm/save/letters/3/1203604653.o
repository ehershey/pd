__Letter "Ok bro. Just keep me informed so i know when the mudlib is ready.Like i said before, Once it is just give me a copy on builders andi'll intergrate the files one at a time so that my security changesstay active. Plus, I'm intending on going thru each file one at atime and write the help files for the lfuns.It's easier if i examine the files one at a time for this like idid for the sfuns."
