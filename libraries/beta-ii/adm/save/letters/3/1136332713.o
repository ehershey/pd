__Letter "Hey, since Stormy is never around, and I asked him but he never responded (only been on like once since I asked), was thinking I'd ask you: Is it possible to get a copy of the core files of the mud? Like, not player saves (aside from my own), no areas outside of tirun or anything, so that I could have a local copy to work with? There's a few things I'd like to test out, and I didn't want to do it on the work port cuz I figured I'd just mess up something and we'd have to wait for one of you to fix it, heheAnyway, having files here that I could work on and alter and have my own backups for, without having to manually ed each and every file to copy them (especially those huge user/living files) would be great.If this is possible, please try to get in touch with me in game, or use my e-mail mr_w@myway.com (this is my \"private\" e-mail, the one I don't give out to websites and such, so it doesn't get spammed or anything).Thanks,Nesoo"
