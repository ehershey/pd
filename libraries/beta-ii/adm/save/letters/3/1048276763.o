__Letter "Oh my. Gabriel got on while you were gone. I tried to talk to him but either he went idle the minute he got on or he ignored me. But one thing caught my eye: He joined Forsaken. Now perhaps that's just a guild he likes, but i kind of cdoubt it is that. Could it be possible that he is so royally pissed off that he joined Forsaken to talk about illuminati? It seems to be a bit against his character, but when gabe is angry i do not think that i would put it past him. I don't know what to think of it. And now i know that he is ignoring me because i sent him several messages and he is unidle and doing stuff, but will not respond. Gabe was one of the strongers  members of ill, and now he's one of the strongest of Forsaken. That gives me a queery feeling inside. But you know him better than i do. YOu make the call. Hopefully,HEather."
