__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Kumi to Helena Fri May 21 15:48:28 2004:-----Thanks for your post on the board. I've been trying to avoid it, and I'm glad to see that instead of hopping on the band wagon you're actually asking them to stop (both saying nice thiings about me and bad things) I don't want to see either myself.I really appreciate it.-Kumi"
