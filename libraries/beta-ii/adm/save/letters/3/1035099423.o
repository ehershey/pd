__Letter "Hey, sup man, there has been alot of talk about me leaving the game over some stupid arguement that I have heard of, and how I can't handle you cutting damage on stuff like bs, well, its a lie, I'm still here I wanted to prove a point to someone who said that there is no way that a level 40 can withstand and live a level 50's bs. So don't worry man, I'm still here and i think your doing a bang up job man so keep it up ehFaust Utaku Ray what ever you feel like calling me :)P.S. This alt was so that people would stop spamming me with stupid shit as soon as i log on so please don't tell anyone. Thanks"
