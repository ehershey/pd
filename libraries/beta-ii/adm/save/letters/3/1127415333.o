__Letter "Seems I don't have the town crier uploaded yet, but perhaps that's for the best, I still have things I want to add to him, but got the ring updated to have proper descriptions. Perhaps by the time you see this I'll be done with the crier. All in all I've got planned directions to oil, ointment, newbie forest, stones, and elven village, all done as part of a story."
