__Letter "I was just thinking about a change to play time, so people who idle all day aren't instantly at the top.  You could implement this without telling anyone so they don't set up triggers and stuff to stay active.  Anyway, the idea is that after a player has been idle for over an hour, their play time timer freezes.  It starts again the next time they do something.  This ensures that who is organized by the people who are not only on the most but active as well.Levi"
