__Letter "One day, there was an assassin.  He was a ferrel, walking around tirun.  He saw another ferrel, aspiring to be the assassin he was.  He wouldn't allow it, so he chopped the ferrel's arms off and sewed them on himself.  He decided then to be a raknid, and an evil one.  He thought, \"Evil?  Unholy!\"  So he wanted to join.Thank you."
