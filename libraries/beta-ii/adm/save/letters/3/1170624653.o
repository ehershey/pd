__Letter "i had quite a few waxes marked and now they are all gonean i know i'm not the only one that is having problems because once i said something a few others said they are missing there waxes as welli know they all autoloaded as well because i checked before i quit outso i'm guessing something is wrong with the belt or the waxesi'm sure this isn't the first time you heard this but i had to tell you"
