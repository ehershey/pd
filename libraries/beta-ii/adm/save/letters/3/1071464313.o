__Letter "yeah, there's a lot.  I dont think the non-angels are at too big of a disadvantage, though.  All the angels have lost millions of xp to go from level 50 to 1 and keep only a third of their stats.  They may do well now, but if they stayed and kept that few mil exp, they'd probably be just as good.  I personally think quest races are a bad idea and dont plan on having any in any game I make subsequently...  but for now, what's done is done                   -Nightshade"
