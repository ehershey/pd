__Letter "All those extra directories \"/zforest/\" \"/zsewers/\" e.t.c. are for extensions I had planned for the area. I had pretty much an entire continent mapped out.The only directories with anything in them linked to the starting [] are the \"/zvillage/\", \"/zforest/\" and \"/zforest/lost/\" folders. These folders are in the \"/rooms/\", \"/mobs/\", \"/weapon/\" and /\"armour/\" directories of \"/keep/\".I could make a map of the entire place. It'd be huge though. Maybe I could load up my ascii mapmaker program and just connect it all in a jpg file and send it over icq?Just say if youw ant a map and I will make one up for you. - Prator"
