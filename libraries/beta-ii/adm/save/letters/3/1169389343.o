__Letter "Hi, dont know if you still want command ideas, but I had one in mind.This would be best for mages, possibly just sorcerors. I call itconvert. A mage would take an object and break it down to its basiccomponents, converting it into mp. This way, objects wouldnt have tobe buried and it can serve a purpose to carry extra stuff. ThanksBatu"
