__Letter "At high levels exp balance can be made perfect by taking Rhondale out of the game.Drow will be the dominant high level exp place.Eios makes 14 mil an hour killing drows he says (he doesnt move as fast as i do. I made around 18 per hour when set as a lvl 70 centaur ranger)I make about 12 mil an hour killing drows (which is balanced)KIlling little mobs i make 12 mil too (since i'm area attacker)Killing rhondale i make 35.Rhondale really needs taking out and then balance will be perfect"
