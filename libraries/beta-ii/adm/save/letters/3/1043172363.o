__Letter "I can be on at least 4-5 days a week, if not more.  At the end of January, I will be getting a laptop computer so getting on in the day shouldn't be a problem.  Right now, I'm limited to using the computer at night since there is a designated time frame for everyone in my house.  I have about 30+ hours time for coding (more when I'm not working)."
