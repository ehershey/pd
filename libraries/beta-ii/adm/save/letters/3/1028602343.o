__Letter "Ive been asked this question a few times, and I told them no it cant be done, but oh well. Can you let me know if its possible? Im including a copy of the tell with abzigal I had that brought that up.Abzigal tells you:question?You reply to Abzigal: supAbzigal tells you:is it possible to have a characters name changedYou reply to Abzigal: yup, you cide and make a new characterAbzigal replies: No,You reply to Abzigal: im seriousAbzigal replies: The character files can be editted.You reply to Abzigal: that would bug the whole characterYou reply to Abzigal: all the eq, all the stats, skills, races and whateverelseAbzigal replies: Yeah but if it was all record before hand it could be donefarly easilyYou reply to Abzigal: dude, it would BUG the whole characterAbzigal replies: So your saying its not possibleAbzigal tells you:becuase someone told me it was possibleYou reply to Abzigal: Im saying its not worth all the headaches that it entailsand stormie wouldnt allow it, and it is pretty much impossible since there aretoo many variables to changeYou reply to Abzigal: who told you that?Abzigal tells you:Well for starters friends on merentha did it. So thats how iknow its possibleYou reply to Abzigal: they did it here?Abzigal replies: Nah on merentha, And i figure that if it was possible onmerentha it would be possible on pdYou reply to Abzigal: you gotta remember, we are not merentha. The only reasonwe look like merentha is because we are using the same type of libAbzigal tells you: Yeah thats what i ment, If your using the same base (lib) asmerentha it should be possible to do most things the same, In the coding areaYou reply to Abzigal: it would be, but we have beaten, shaped, cut off, andrevamped the lib we first started onAbzigal replies: Yeah.You reply to Abzigal: other players have asked that same question and have beenturned down, just so you dont feel like the only one lolAbzigal replies: Nah i don't really care"
