__Letter "Petrarch and those who care,I am shocked to hear that Primal Darkness was accused of something, an incredibly speculative accusation that has no proof or reality.Your post was incredibly over-destructive when you were trying to prove a simple point: Make unique passwords for different games.  Why then did you feel it necessarry to shift the blame on another MUD?  Could it not just be a mistake on your own part?  No, of course not.  Petrarch doesn't make mistakes and if someone dissapoints him in any way, he'll bann them.**  If he can't bann them, he'll just resort to slander.I'll admit Merentha is an awesome game, with lots of awesome people and I've had great experiences so far.  However, what was said today totally disgusts me and causes me to lose all respect for the staff.  I can't blame them, I mean Jewel would never hear the end of it if she dissagreed with Pet (Anyone remember Sept.11 debate?) but I'm just really dissapointed right now.**Half an hour after I post this.Midnight, Leviathas... take your pick."
