__Letter "If you bring a camera with you to the jungle I expect to get a lot of Jake-Jungle-Porn.Make sure you get that scanner. =)I finished the picture of Furion's death mask...  it looks really rotten (as in decayed) but I'll let you be the judge.  I'm also thinking of doing a picture of Furion going berserk but that all depends on when I can finish all these essays/ISUs.  Yea, plenty of those to go around.Tomorrow I am going to see this guy who does the physical training for my city's hockey team.  He's going to tell me how to use my bowflex and stuff so I don't end up with one shoulder that looks like it has a baby in it and another that looks like it belongs to some 80 year old woman.What else...  I went to the Two Towers Exhibit in Toronto.  It was great.  I got to walk through Fangorn forest (or part of it) and Merry and Pippin stand in one scene where I was.  I got to see all the weapons and stuff and desperately wanted to steal Glamdring (Gandalf's sword) but that would involve having to kill a lot of cops with it.  I could probably take them but the people of Toronto would produce ninjas and overwhelm me with ninja stars.Not even Yoda can withstand 10000 ninja stars."
