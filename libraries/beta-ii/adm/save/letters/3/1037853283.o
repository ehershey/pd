Unfortunately, mistakes do happen now and then. Because every figure is hand painted and assembled, none of the figures are exactly alike. Often times broken figures can easily be glued back together using any miniatures glue (very sparingly.) However, if you received an incomplete or mislabeled figure and would like it replaced, please do the following: For replacement of a broken or incomplete figure, send all of the pieces of the figure to the address below. We must receive the majority of the parts before we will issue a replacement, if you did not receive all parts, you must send everything that you did receive. **If your figure is missing a small piece, or has an incorrect dial insert please note that we are unable to replace individual parts of figures. We are only able to replace the complete figure, so please send it in for a complete replacement. For replacement of a misassembled or mislabeled figure, send the complete figure to the address below. If you received the base of one figure and the miniature of another you can request replacement for either one of the figures. You must include a note specifying which figure you would like to receive, or we will choose for you. We will replace figures within one year of their manufacture date, so please make sure to send them in as soon as you get them. Please note that our replacement policy extends only to figures that are broken or damaged in manufacturing, so please be careful with your figures as we will not be able to replace them should they break due to misuse. For replacement of any figure you must provide the following information: Name Address Telephone Number E-Mail address (if you have one) Store where you purchased the figure Phone Number of above store Approximate date purchased Mail all figures to: WizKids Games Attn: Customer Service-Quality 12145 Centron Place Cincinnati, OH 45246 Please mail your figures in a box or a padded envelope, the US Mail system is unable to handle regular envelopes that contain bulky items such as figures, and WizKids can not be responsible for shipments that are improperly mailed. Please allow 4-5 weeks to receive your completed figure back in the mail. Thank you for your patience. "
