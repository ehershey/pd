__Letter "The shining amulet is made of a bright %^BOLD%^YELLOW%^golden%^RESET%^ metal, showing a pair of scales backed with the %^RED%^BOLD%^flaming%^RESET%^ sun. On one side of the scales there is a %^BOLD%^WHITE%^silver sword%^RESET%^, thrusting downwards through the scale, signifying violence. On the other there is a pure %^BOLD%^WHITE%^white dove%^RESET%^ about to take wing, signifying peace. This is a rare gift given only to those who the Illuminati belive have a chance of repentance."
