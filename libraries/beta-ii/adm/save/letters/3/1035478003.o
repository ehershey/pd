__Letter "Firstly, thanks for getting them in.  I know I'm just betaing it right now so I don't mind that it sucks, 'cause that's what I'm here for after all. heheOkay, firstly, I assume bears strength lies in melee and attack, right?Attack costs 2 million for me to raise at one point at 44 attack.  It's SOOOOO damn expensive that I bet I have the highest attack out of all druids at a grand total of 44 (died. hehe).So I would suggest lowering the attack cost a bit and/or bumping up attack and melee.  I haven't ever paid attention to melee so I don't know if it's expensive or not to raise for druid.Swipe? Eh... Took me 15 swipes more or less to kill a Shadowguard. He raped me though so I had to retreat because of not having armorI don't mind that he raped me since it was extended combat and I didn't have armorBut I should have killed him in one or two rounds ideally being as how this is an elite spell.I like the idea of how you have no mp.  Keep it like that.I also suggest that you can't rub oil or apply ointment.  Why? Because of a trade off.  Bears can be ultra powerful but can't healTo make it so people can't morph into bears, attack, morph out, rub oil, repeat.  I would suggest putting in a delay before you can morph into a bear again.Say 25 rounds?Another thought has to do with the \"feral\" instinctLike, you *can* morph back into a bear before your 25 rounds are up, but you run the risk of your fearl instinct taking over.If it does take over, you randomly starting wondering around and attacking anything and everything you see.But, if you like that idea I would suggest making it some sort of change to the bear in the future and for now setting a mandatory wait time before you can go back.Also, my name didn't change in the who list to a bear.And, I could fly.  WEE! FLYING BEAR!heheBuddy, you've dun good.  And I'll continue to help you to make someting that everyone can be proud of.  One day, you will be known as Nightshade the Bear Maker, instead of Nightshade the Mud Crasher <g>-ROAR!"
