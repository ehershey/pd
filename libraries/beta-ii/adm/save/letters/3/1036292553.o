__Letter "Ok i will make this pretty short. Most people know that jesters are underpowered. When you read this i'll probably be about lvl 25-30 and i'm lvl 23 atm. Currently all i have is flick,trip,cut and throw for attacking abilities. Of these cut is the only one which i can really use to xp with.-Entertainment costs WAY to much for a skill max of 138 it took me 40k to get from 10 to 15 which is about lvl 2 max-Double wielding is also very costly-Blunt i think all wanderers get alot of this and it is WAY to expensive and we have no abils which use the skill-Jesters get murder,stealth,stealing,locks which basically do nothing for us since we have no ksills that benefit from them and we also get perception and bargaining which are not very useful either-At lvl 23 I don't really know what abils/song i should have since i can't train my main skill(entertainment) and i don't even know if i should have juggle yet.-Making entertainment cost the same as euphony would seem about right to me.-Maybe we could get some just fun abils which help train entertainment like dazzle or something-I think we should just get some new, unique abils around lvl 30 but i realise that could take awhile but one would be nice i'm not even sure what kind of abils jesters should have since i don't know much about them and theres alot of other priorities i think the admins have currently-A little md would be nice even if its like 2 per lvl or what not.-Probably the most important things would be to fix the skills cost of entertainment and blunt and such. An ability which uses the blunt skill. And a strong lvl 30 abil to use in xping.Thats it really i've been pretty vague but i think jesters really need some improvements/fixing. :DThanks in advance Stormy"
