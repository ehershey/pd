__Letter "a little more detail on the bug with the ring:  The bug occurs when someone wearing it gets sentanced to death and their belongings get moved to the store (2 pks)  calling move() on the ring causes the code to bug, so the player has some of their stuff moved, but isnt killed and keeps their outlaw status.  The last tiem this happened the player was stuck in the courtroom til I moved them out.  Anyway, if you could fix that, that'd be great.             -NS"
