__Letter "dude I totally lost my cool and exploded on a player. The other players got pissed and the player ended up getting pked, Casp got mad, and she had good reason to, her last message before she left was Caspurnia replies: i'll just leave, this isn't where i'm comfortable anymore it was because other players were giving her flack over things she said. I made all of them shut up but apparently they were still giving her crap over tells or saays. I apologize to you and to her. If she does not return I will undrstand. If you wish to go, I will understand that too.Gonna go sleep now.Stormy"
