__Letter "Well well. I had my first experience in death today. Fortunately your friend Prator gave me a rez. :) I was able to get some of my cool eq back, but I'm going to be poor again soon. I was able to get the wolf cloak and boots, and the banded armour, and my daggers back. But I lost my array of color-changing dresses. I guess the reason i lost it all was because I died fighting the king cobra. And my eq and weapons sunk into teh quick sand. *frown* So I'll have to meet w/you again soon to get some of the missing stuff back. ~p And definitely to get some more color-changing dresses *sexy smirk* Maybe I'll see you on sometime soon.*savannah kisses you passionately and waves goodbye.*"
