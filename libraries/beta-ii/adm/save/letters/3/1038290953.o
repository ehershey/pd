__Letter "Softly glowing pillars flank the entryway, reaching far overhead. Smooth walls rise to meet in lofty vaults, the highest points obscured by mist. Sprouting from the center of this perfectly round chamber is a grand and majestic tree. Soft white light filters down through its wide, sheltering branches and leaves. Ancient, gnarled roots spread across the cavern floor, creating nooks and resting places for creatures of all sizes. look pillars: carved intricately with images of all sorts of creatures, these pillars seem to bar any unwelcome beings from entering.look walls: these white walls are so smooth to the touch that it feels as though they were stitched of silk and not hewn out of solid stone.look vaults: high sweeping vaults form the ceiling here, though most of your view is obscured by a soft mist.look tree: Gnarled and twisted, this tree speaks to you of eons past. Its proud branches reach towards the vaulted ceiling, fanning and spreading out into vast numbers of brilliant emerald green leaves. Small vines creep like tendrils out and over its trunk and down to a maze of roots, which lace the stone floor, creating many comfortable places to sit and rest.look light: a soft, faintly pulsing white light shines from all around you, gently filling this cavern and filtering down through the tree's branches.look mist: this soft mist obscures the highest points of the ceiling.Smell: A tantalizing scent reaches your nostrils, just out of your memory's grasp.Sound: There is faint rustling, almost as if the tree is stirring.Softly glowing pillars flank the entryway, reaching far overhead.
