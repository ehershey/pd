__Letter "I had a request from Scourge- after the guild stuff is all rebalanced, do you think you could post the changes in the relevant guild's board? Just so it's not guesswork for them. I mean, only post Forsaken's stuff in Forsaken- keep other guilds guessing about what the others have, but each guild should know their own equipment, you know? Just a suggestion..."
