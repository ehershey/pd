__Letter "I noticed you were wondering, so here's my explination...Basicly, I left because I left Kumi know that when Hermes came back around... I was going to leave so me and him could kick it. He's here... and I hadn't done it yet. Tonight I just got miffed and some of my buttons pushed by kumi... and nothing against her, but It's just what sent me over the edge. No hard feelings to anybody, even her, in the guild... It's just time for me to bounce. You can still hit me up if you need help or anything.Anybody can... let them know that. That includes parties.Thanks,   Cookie"
