__Letter "I was just hoping you could do me a personal favor when you had a free moment. There is no rush, and If you cannot access what I am asking, I ask you just forward this to an admin that can assist me. I had to ask Daos for the email I used to make my characters as I had forgotten, and I was hoping I can get a list of all the characters I made with said email, as I have forgotten a handful of their names. The email is veritasix@hotmail.com . If you could help me obtain this information I would be greatly appreciative.I was just hoping you could do me a personal favor when you had a free moment.
