__Letter "Couple quick ones for you guys:New slash is awesome I love it. Definetly solves the raknid issue.Stab and cut need similar changes so that raknid isnt overpowered. Piehl does 600 damage to me with stab in arena. He has large stats and deserves this. However a 1.2k stab from a raknid of that size would be nuts. Rhuan (my gypsy) does too much damage with quad cut. It kills a 38k in 2 rounds with his low stats. As gypsy and bard has no sp boosting ability, the sp cost could use lowering in addition to removing the raknid quad cut. This would balance it similar to the excellent balance slash currently has.Thats all from me (oh ya.. quest race abilities really could use help).Thanks,-- Vyce"
