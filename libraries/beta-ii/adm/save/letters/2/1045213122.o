__Letter "Nightshade as i understand it has changed our armour class and he i believe has balanced it out which is cool =) but the thing is we xp slow i mean we don't make much more xp then we did after level 37 mainly cause it takes so much more sp but if breathe was room affect which i believe all the dragons think it should plus it's realistic cause dragons are huge and have a huge firebreath this would mean a bit faster xp if we were in combat with monsters and and we cast breathe it hits and with the massive sp it takes already it would be quiet balanced and fair my 10 cents thans"
