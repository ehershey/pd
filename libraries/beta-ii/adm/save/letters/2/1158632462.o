__Letter "hey man i just wanted to hit ya up with my thoughts about the snap change. pvp was fine i thought it worked better actually, but when I went to try to xp I was devistated. I went from insta'ing 48k mobs to instaing 35k mobs. it crippled me as rhon was my primary xp and now I cant run it fast enough, so either i'm tempted to die down or remort. i dont mean to be a whiner but i figured i'd try sending you a mail since i dont know what else to do."
