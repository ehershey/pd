__Letter "Hey Love, unfortunatly I never got a shower last night because I was wrapped up in a movie my mother and father were watching last night when I got off of the computer, and this morning my alarms never went off so I never got up...so yeah I'm home from school today. It's 5:15 your time so I'm assuming you're still sleeping *smiles* You know you are the cutest thing ever, just knowing that you are thinking about me this much makes my heart melt but then when you said you wanted me to be there so that I could hold you in my arms made it even worse. I miss you so much and it's starting to get to me, everywhere I go and everthing I do it's always I wonder how Simran's doing, is she doing alright, is she having a good day/night, is she smiling, is she thinking about me, is she having a good dream? I love thinking about you all the time though because I just love you, I love everything about you, your shortness (little girl!) your cuteness, your personality, your ability to care so much about me, how you think about me, and from what I'm getting at you look so beautiful too. *sighs happily* You really are the perfect girl and I can't wait to finally be able to see you in real life so that way I can finally just hold you close and tightly and never let you go. How I wish I could just hold your hand and dance (me dance *laughs* But I'll do it for you :) ) in the rain and then gently kiss your lips after the dancing. Alright, I'm definatly rambling now, even though I'm sure you don't care :), but I'm going to go ahead and go back to sleep I guess...I dunno if you usually log on in the mornings when you wake up because I'm sure you have stuff to do, such as get all wet while taking a shower *winks*. But if you do get on send me a mail back if you can, I miss you so much! I love you Beautiful, you mean everything to me.Forever yours,Josh"
