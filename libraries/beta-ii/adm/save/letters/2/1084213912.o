__Letter "i mudmailed a warning to Kumi and Orcha about whatever war they have going on. this is the reply i got back from kumi.-----Original message sent by Kumi to Azire on Mon May 10 08:25:18 2004:-----I already talked to orcha, and I put him on ignore. Last night, the only reason I got into that with him, was for completely personal reasons. Things like that don't normally happen. Wisp shouldn't have involved herself, they only egged me on further. I'm not saying what I did was right, because I know it wasn't right, but what I did doesn't deserve gagment. As for you, I don't want you talking to me anymore. I think you're a horrible imm, and you don't really do anything beneficial to the mud. If you have problems with me, please take it up with NS, and have him deal with me, or have another imm deal with me, because I'm quite through with you."
