__Letter "There is no documentation on this function. I need to know it's formatting,Main things i need to know are the following;   1) it's format. What i need to have the function in the objects      return so that the object gets cloned with the values i want.   2) I need to know the order the functions are called.      create() >> init_arg() >> init() ?? is that order the functions      would be called in ??===================================================================What im trying to do is help smokey develop a type of weapon for his area.It would hold diff \"runes\" and do functions stored on those runes. I wantto do it with query_autoload() to reload the weapon and then pass whichrunes were installed in the weapon with init_arg(). But there is no docson init_arg() for me to go on. Usually i turn to you when i run into thingslike this and need details clarified :)I can help him code it up. I just need to know how init_arg() works."
