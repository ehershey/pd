__Letter "I shall go down there and speak to them myself. They should know better, perhaps they have forgotten who's husband you are. I will show them what happens to them when they become the sacrifice to Zaal (yes, I know that is from sm, but I don't know the gods here!)! You should have no problems from them in the future, after I put them in there place, remember my magic is different than yours, I know how to handle the dead. I have ways of controlling them, they are soon to understand. With Love,Empy~ "
