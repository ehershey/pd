__Letter "The shining amulet is made of a bright golden metal, showing a pair of scales backed with the flaming sun. In one side of the scales there is a sword, thrusting downwards through the scale, signifying violence. On the other there is a dove about to take wing, signifying peace. This is a rare gift given only to those who the Illuminati belive have a chance of repentance."
