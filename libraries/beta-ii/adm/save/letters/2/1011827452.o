__Letter "Hey Whit :) I got a name and basic description for my guild... here it is:Name: ForsakenDescription: The Forsaken Guild is a guild of the masters of battle and the arts of warfare. Skilled in both the physical and magical disciplines their name invokes fear into all who would oppose them. The Forsaken wander the lands in search of challenge and treasure, and a member is easily distinguished by the ring he bears and the coldness in his eyes and heart.I'll email room descriptions to you and stuff like that cause i tend to mess stuff up in mudmails a little bit heh. My email is Cheshire_Cat622@hotmail.comThx man and I hope the guild is to your liking :)-- Ashram the Black Knight"
