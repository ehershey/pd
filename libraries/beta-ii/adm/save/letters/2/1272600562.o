__Letter "Aeldritch says: helloVian waves.You say: Hi Aeldritch, how are you today?Aeldritch says: Fine, thank you.Aeldritch bows before you.You say: First off, why are you interested in building on the mud?Aeldritch says: I like to build worlds. It's very creative.You nod solemnly.You say: Do you have any prior building experience?Aeldritch says: Yes, I have coded on old Padermud and had my own domain there.You say: What kind of mud is Padermud?Aeldritch says: LPMud.You say: I see you have made it to high mortal.  How familiar do you think youare with the game?Aeldritch says: I have mostly been in Tirun and environs.You say: Part of building is being familiar with the areas in the game and avariety of different classes.  Have you had any other characters?Vian asks: What do you mean the environs?Aeldritch says: just a ranger. Environs means the area around something. MyEnglish is rather British, I'm a afraid.You say: Can you elaborate more on what has interested you to apply for abuilder position?Aeldritch says: I've noticed that most areas here are done rathersuperficially. There are often nouns in the room long that are not to be foundwhen trying to look at them. There is also a lack of newbie equipment fornon-fighter classes and I have not yet found a single item that would beadequate for an imp.Aeldritch says: I like your players. Very considerate and polite people.You say: We are aware of the problem with newbie equipment and have beenworking on a solution.Aeldritch says: Not just for newbies. A few imps around to kill with some nicerobes and weapons would go a long way towards equipping imps.You say: I'm glad that you noticed the glaring omission of nouns in a lot ofthe rooms.Aeldritch says: I wanted to apply later, but I mentioned the fact toStormbringer in a mail the other day and he was quite interested.You say: We also have been doing a restructuring of several of the areas thatexist in the game.Aeldritch says: I'm a stickler for details. If it's mentioned in the long, itshould be there to look at.You say: Your interest in building is to make the mud more newbie friendly aswell as fill in the gaps for certain races.  Is that correct?Aeldritch says: I think the newbies are already being taken care of, but Iassume some of my items may be of use there.You nod solemnly.Aeldritch says: Though I like to have a magic weapon with a special now andthen, but not distribute them wholesale.Aeldritch says: If you want a new area for xping, I can do a nice hauntedcastle for any level range you specify.You say: I take it you have done a lot of work in the balance department.Aeldritch says: actually no. I just tend to plan my screwups beforehand.Aeldritch says: we did have some trouble with unbalanced weapons on padermud.You say: I concur that planning out an area or a project is essential tobuilding.Aeldritch says: including one by an arch that one-hit-killed any member of aspedific race, including quest npcps.You say: We don't have a system based on materials.  There are no propertiesfor material based armor.Aeldritch says: It's easier. So players can assume that for instance steel willbe better than iron and that any chainmail will be weaker against piercing thanplatemail. The AC is just computed from the values.You nod solemnly.Aeldritch says: So if I create an iron chainmail I take the base value for ironand multiply it by a chainmail factor and put that as ac. If any of thesefactors need changing, that is done in one file.Aeldritch says: of course, special equipment is another matter but this allowsfor very consistent and varied run-of-the-mill equipment that can be used orsold.You say: From a building standpoint, one material is going to be heavier thanthe other and have a higher AC value.You say: We just don't have a system that handles material properties.Aeldritch says: you don't need to. It's all done in the actual file. Instead ofac=40, I just include a file and say ac=IRON*CHAINMAIL_MUL, for instance.You say: If we introduced such a system, one way to go about implementing itwould be to create another function to set the type of material for a piece ofarmor and that would use the base values that are set up in an include file.Aeldritch says: same thing for values and weights.You say: You could also go about it with an include file and a define for eachof the material types.Aeldritch says: if you want to make it global. I had only thought of it as away to make items consistent and balancable in my area.Aeldritch says: or one file for weapons and one for armour.You say: I would create it as part of the server object that handles all of theproperties of the area.You say: That is provided you use a server object.Aeldritch says: that would be one way.You say: I'm sorry, but starting to get sidetracked.Aeldritch says: the same could be done with monsters. Tier one, Tier two, etc.You say: Do you have any example work from the other mud?You say: Nulvect informs me that he is receptive to the idea to add a systemfor materials if one of us would do the groundwork.Aeldritch says: I wasn't going to ask for a lib rewrite for this. Not anymore,the core team got rid of a lot of creators and started fresh. Rather uglybusiness with a lot of brown-nosing involved.You nod solemnly.You say: On average, how much time would you be able to contribute to the mud?You say: I realize that people have a life outside of a game.Aeldritch says: most days, 2-3 hours, sometimes more. I'm currently unemployed.You nod solemnly.Aeldritch says: I'm based in Germany. That's GMT+1.You say: Yeah, unfortunately I know a lot of people that are unemployed.You say: Is there anything that you would like to ask?Aeldritch says: I could probably do the 2-3 hours even if I do find work soon.I'm a programmer so I should be able to be online at work.Aeldritch asks: nothing particular. Would you prefer me to make a new area orwork over an existing one?You say: Right now the mud could really use a few more areas.You say: If there is an area that you really like, you are free to make anexpansion onto that area.Aeldritch asks: Haunted castle? Ghosts, zombies, skeletons for xping, room fora quests or two. Living population above ground, extensive dungeon underground?You say: I think if you want to go ahead with the haunted castle idea, thatwould be a great addition.Aeldritch asks: for what level range?Aeldritch says: is a mad king ok as a central character? Somewhere betweenRichard III and Macbeth.You say: Good level range would be around 30-40Aeldritch says: 30-40, ok.You nod solemnly.Aeldritch says: so be it.You say: Before we close the interview, did you have any questions in generalabout the mud or anything?Aeldritch says: no, I'll ask if I need anything.You nod solemnly."
