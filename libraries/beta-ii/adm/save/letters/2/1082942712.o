__Letter "Aziraphale enters.'followingAziraphale attacks Gob!Aziraphale smites Gob in a spray of blood.Aziraphale tickles Gob in the torso with his holy sword.Aziraphale grazes Gob in the left foot with his holy sword.Aziraphale hits Gob ineffectively in the torso.Aziraphale taps Gob in the torso with his holy sword.Aziraphale tickles Gob in the right arm with his holy sword.Aziraphale tickles Gob in the torso with his holy sword.Gob dismounts off of Wisp.A flash of lightning marks the death of Gob.Gob dies a horrible death.Now, i know i've only been here for two years, and i'm not trying to be a whiny b*tch, but everyone knows he cheated, and i know he lost 600million exp, but i'm willing to bet the he had been and probably still has been scripting long enough to make way more than that, his char is only 26 yrs old and mine is 25. i exp for about 6 hours a day 5 days a week and i've probably accumulated less than 500million total, to be where he is which is probably a worth of about 20 billion exp, there's no way he's not still scripting...and even if did stop i dont think he was punished severely enough. When i abused that stasis bug i honestly had no idea about the rule regarding that and i was arrested for 30 days, i'm sure if evo had complained more i would have been dested. Why was he allowed to keep his character after breaking a rule a million times worse than the one i broke?i'm just sayin that he obviously cheated for more than 600mil and he's waaay to powerful to be goin around smiting people that dont bother anyone for no reason.. something should be donejust my two cents anyways"
