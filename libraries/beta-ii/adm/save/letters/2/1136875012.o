__Letter "Hello, this is Troopers alternate character. Since trooper is still gagged, I have submitted this via this character.I have recently noticed that Furiae has been using profanity on the public board. She used the acronym \"lmao\", which, if you do not know, means laughing my ass off. That is a direct violation of the no profanity rule, and Furiae needs the same swift punishment Trooper received. Since trooper has been gagged for an elongated amount of time, I believe that Furiae should not serve that entire time, but perhaps the first half of Trooper's punishment. Levi, you told me yourself if I found someone using bad words like \"ass\" then they'd be punished just the same as me. Furiae has used profanity, or, what is a \"synonym\" to profanity, on the public board. "
