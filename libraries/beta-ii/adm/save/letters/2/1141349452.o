__Letter "thanks bud :) now that i understand how they work i'll be trying them on my own :)Thats all i ever ask for.  One working model of the technique im trying to learn and i can figure it out :PIt was the save file for Quessalaz that did it honestlySeems that quiz_track mapped like this for me ;              quiz_track[pname][\"quiz\"][\"question\"][\"answer\"][\"score\"]so the nesting is like this if i read the records.o file right       pname( quiz(question,answer);score)If that is correct then i think i really can handle them from this point on :)Next thing i wanna learn tho is how to sort out the information if you can mail the ironman@builder a sample of a sorting routine (or put it in his home directory)---Ironmanp.s. --- If you haven't figured it out by now, im eager to learn new things :)"
