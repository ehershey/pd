__Letter "I need instructions here folks.When Nulvect and i discussed the topic, he seemed to like the ideaof a central commerce system for our players. Amun however jumpedin and told me to scrap the idea....Personally, I feel that having a central storage and store systemfor guilds and/or players would be a boost to our player base andguilds.Please get back to me. To code or not to code. This is the question.====================================================================A refined version of the idea.mapping staff_tracking=([]);string  file_target;object target;int SP, PP, GP ;     ** staff_price, guild_price, player_price **    if(!present(target)) return 0;    if(staff_tracking == ([]) ) return 0;    file_target=check_ids(target);    **check_ids() is an sfun i                                        have on builders. Ill be                                        simulating it in the system    if(!staff_tracking[file_target]) return 0;    if(staff_tracking < (guild_pricing + player_pricing) ) return 0;==================================================================This is a stripped down psudo_code but it shows you what i have inmind and how it will operate as a whole. Objects will be traced viatheir file_names. The sum of what the guild wants + the sum of whatthe player wants has to be >= to what the staff has set for theminimal pricing. If not, the sale is refused to be placed.These items will be removed from memory and just left in a tracingmapping. the tracking object will be saved and loaded NOT an objectholding the objects within it. This object will keep tallies ofeach object posted for sale and its asking prices.=================================================================Again, I think having a fixed way for players to buy and sell therarer equipment would be a major draw to our home here. If you donot wish it to be in the guild system, I can easily design it asan open_marketplace instead.Please reply.I'm again setting Sunday aside to code this. I wasted most of lastSunday cause i was told not to work on it. Please tell me what actionif any to take here.Ironman"
