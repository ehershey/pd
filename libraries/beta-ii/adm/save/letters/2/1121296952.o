__Letter "I got your tell, but there's really nothing left to talk about...I feel the mud is dying and until something concrete happens toprove otherwise, that is how I will continue to feel. I've doneeverything I can think of to try to make it otherwise, but thereis nothing more I can do here.In case I vanish and you need to get ahold of me, oiche00@gmail.com"
