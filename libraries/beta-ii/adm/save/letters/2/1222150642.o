__Letter "Hello love, just a brief note to let you know you are thought ofand loved, etc. I will tell you about the further drama betweenRohl and Freddie and Aethion and now myself, heh. But, tonight,like always, but just a bit more than usual, you've been on mymind. :) I saw you pop on and off with nenet in the time I wasaway helping the dispatcher. But, now it's time to go back towork. :(Be well, rest easy, for you are loved immensely. :) Take care,sweet lady.All my love,Your James"
