__Letter "Check out /tmp/exp_test.cpp when you get a chance (yes, it's a C++ program, you'll have to copy/paste or cp it to /ftp/ and download it).I have it set to not show levels that earn 0 xp that are below the player's level, which is why level 20 suddenly shrinks the list (it's the first one to have 0 xp for a kill below the player's level).I think the level 20+ regions could use a hair more leeway on what can be killed without a penalty; what do you think?"
