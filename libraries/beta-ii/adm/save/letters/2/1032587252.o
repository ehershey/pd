__Letter "If wraith finishes up the two rooms, I believe it will costs us 325,000 gold, go ahead and pay him.  If you need my go ahead, just forward this mail to wraith, cause I'm giving you permission to pay for the room.  If it's more then that, go ahead and pay for it, I'm just estimating according to the help guild addons.  If you can find out how much a room with a board will cost us, I thought it stated it in the same help file, but I don't see it now.  Go through the two rooms and make sure everything is spelled right and that my hawaiian grammer doesn't sound too pathetic.  I told wraith that if he wanted to add color, it didn't matter to me, I was just happy to get the darn things out of the way.Side note:  Keep a watch on byblos, faust told me he is trouble, if you want more info on that, we'll talk outside of mudmail.  Other then that everything seems to be in order.  I will try and make it on tomorrow 9-21, but hubby's days off is every Sat and Sun, and heugh, acidently hit enter, anyways, and he's been trying to only mud on the weekends, a lot of things pissed him off on this mud within the last mud.  (Plus he got a new playstation game)I must be tired, was proof-reading my stuff, that was within the last month (not mud).  If all else fails, see ya on monday if I don't see ya on before."
