__Letter "I got an idea that will balance necros 100%.  You might thing it's overpowering at first, but send me a tell and I'll tell you all the specifics.The downside is I think it will be a *very* complex spell, however with Whit, yours, and Daos's help I think we could pull it off.And if all else fails I could send Nightshade an email asking for his help.You'll love this, Stormy.  Trust meAnd another thing,I think I've proved myself beyond a doubt that I'm more then competant and trustworthy as an immortal. So could you take the gloves off of me? It'd make things a lot easier for me.Admit it, I'm just freaking awesome. winkwinkNah, I'm really not arrogant, I just act that way because... well, I have no idea why.But trust me, I don't strut around like I'm the king of the world."
