__Letter "I've told you before. Sorry he buried your stuff, tho. I suggested he use it as leverage to end war. I also talked to Sopboo tonight, good talk. But he's all gung ho. Don't wanna end nothing.Once again, sorry. But he's a grown man. And when you wanna call people out, sometimes it devolves into this.I hope Stormbringer can do something for ya.Uza"
