__Letter "well, its not a personal matter, though i guess the fact he wants to divorce her kinda isanyway, the point of this mail is because i don't want to upset all the imms and admins with this if i don't have to.Orcha pretty much wants to divorce his wife char, ayumi, but she's apparently never really on. Orcha tells me that he was sitting the in the square, and Ayumi simply got some rogue cleric to marry him to her.I don't really think thats what i call a legal marriage (having played a cleric and married some people on this mud). He's requested to be divorced from Ayumi, with force if need be, because she's never on and with the way she married him, prolly won't agree to a divorce.What do you think?"
