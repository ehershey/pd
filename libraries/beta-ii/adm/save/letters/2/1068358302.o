__Letter "Hey Azire,Long time no see.  I have been in Montreal for a few days but even before then I haven't been at PD much.  Get on MSN or something so we can keep in touch.Montreal was so much fun.  I got a chance to get out of this place and explore.  I went to a few classes at McGill University and went shopping by myself when my friend had to go to some classes that I couldn't get away with being in.  The fashions there are amazing and renew my hope in mankind.  I have to move to Montreal.  I will die if I don't.  It's so nice there.  Montreal, Montreal, Montreal.  I have a big crush on a guy named Toran there.  He's pretty flamboyant but for the first time in my life it isn't a turn off.  When everyone else took Taxis from bar to bar, he and I walked together and talked, and we talked so much that we walked 3 blocks past the street we were supposed to turn onto.  Going home sucked.  Anyway I just need to get some amazingly good marks now and then I can also go off to university.  Excitement is killing me.  Talk to you soon hopefully.Levi"
