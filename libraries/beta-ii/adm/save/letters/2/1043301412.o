__Letter "Im going to implement it on Builders to see if it will work, but, heres the scoop on this multi-play system im working on.This new system, will have a type of security to it not seen before here.  I came up with the idea a little while ago, and I feel I can make it work.  Players with LANS will have to register their lans, if they dont, then they will not be allowed on.  For example:A logs on.  He has a LAN.  B tries to log on at the same time as A.   Unless A lists B's name on A's lan list, he will not be allowed on.  So, A will add B's name to his LAN list.  B will then be able to log on the mud while A is online.  Now, say B logs online, and A wants to come online as well, but after B has already came online, A will still be allowed to enter.  Like I said, I will have a demonstration for you to look at.  If you like it, I will be able to implement it easily.  If you dislike it, we could still use a better <apply> command.Whit"
