__Letter "Vian was awaken from his slumber on his schoonerin the middle of the night.  He knew not what washappening, and knew not the voices surrounding him.He heard a purring and swords, and then felt himselfbeing lifted and carried.  He couldn't see, and hecouldn't struggle.  His arms and legs were tied withrope..  Why didn't his guards save him?  He was takenout on and suddenly felt pelted with rain.  The rainsoaked the bandana that was blinding him, and it fellto his neck.  There they were.. all of his mates, anda new man, a bastet, he had never seen before.\"Arr, ye scoundrel, I be Davyn and I be takin over thefine crew ye have.  Putten 'em in a war.. ye be theleast smartest cap'n I ever seen!  Thats why I'm takinyer title!\" said Davyn.;The bastet, Davyn, sliced the rope between Vian's legs,;and pushed him to the plank.;\"It's time for ye to walk, boy.\"Davyn threw a single, dull, useless sword to Vian andpushed him farther.  Vian stumbled in to the water, inthe middle of the ocean."
