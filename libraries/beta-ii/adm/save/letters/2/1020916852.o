__Letter "The latest P4 runs at 2.53 GHz with a FSB(Front Side Bus, speed of motherboard) speed of 133Mhz and CPU<->RAM speed of 533MHz, it costs about $533 (Prices are US$).The latest Athlon runs at 1.73 GHz with a FSB speed of 133 MHz and CPU<->RAM speed of 266MHz, it costs about $229.The fastest P4's are faster than the Athlon's in pretty much anything, however the athlon cpu's are much, much cheaper.While Athlon's do run hotter than P4's, it should not make a difference in the stability of the cpu. An athlon will run without error at temperatures up to 55C. As long as the processor has adequate cooling heat will never be an issue.Ok, I'll get on to a basic explanation of why Athlon's and P4's are so similar in power.When Intel made the P4 they started to focus on the MHz rating of the CPU since they new that most people do not know what determines the actaul power of a processor. AMD took the other path with the Athlon Thunderbird.The power of a processor is a complicated equation involving many factors, but here is something basic. Every time a cpu completes a cycle it goes through a series of steps called a 'pipeline'. The MHz rating of a cpu shows how many times a pipeline is completed each second. With longer pipeline the cpu can complete more intructions per Hz.Athlon cpu's have a much longer pipeline than P4's, however P4's have a much higher MHz rating.None of this really matters to the end user though since the result is the same. Only those who are doing things that are extremely cpu intensive will notice a difference. Things that are cpu intensive are video editing tools, MPG and AVI encoding. Proffesional 3D rendering. Large calculation programs like Folding @ home and Seti @ Home.The power of the CPU does have an effect on 3D gaming, however the graphics card is much more important for this.If you are just using normal windows applications any P4, Athlon XP or Athlon Thunderbird is good enough. The differences between them are minimal.The main issue for a new cpu is cost, and to a lesser amount, heat.If money is not an issue than you can get the P4 because it is a little faster and runs cooler. However, if you are on a budget the athlon is the better choice because it is alot cheaper. Remember that if the computer is kept in a hot room (30C or more), if the computer case does not have good airflow or if the cpu does not have a good enough heatsink and fan, then it will be much more prone to overheating.Hmmm, that is all I can think of for the moment. If this wasn't the explanation you were looking for, or if you want to know more or pretty much anything, just tell me or mudmail me if I'm not on.	- Aziraphale"
