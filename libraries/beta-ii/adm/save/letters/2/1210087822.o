__Letter "Was thinking this thru even further.It would be very easy for me to design a central financial system for PD.I'm thinking a central object that the stores can all referance for presetpricing. It would be a much more efficent and truer to the going ratesof objects.I mean since im going to be creating a system for guilds to have and run stores.it wouldn't be much harder to make a cleaner system for the regular stores touse. Same with bars.Dont worry. I would be making it reverse compatable.My whole point of this plan was to provide the players with a way to stockpileitems for their clanmates. It evolved into a store system for 2 reasons. One,if the storage system remembers the objects thru reboots, then the AL systemhas to be taken into account. Two, giving guilds a unifying goal to work on.Being a storefront, any object placed in it would be remembered thru reboots.Because it would be remembered, the only way the object would be retrievableis to be BOUGHT out of the storage system.It then evolved into waht prices to charge. First stage would be a centralobject( perhaps an sfun) that the admins would regulate the rare objects'pricing with. Second is if the guildmasters wish to set prices for an object.Third is if the person putting the item into the hold wants to set a price.  1) staff_pricing is the LOWEST possible price an object can be sold at.  2) guild_pricing is the LOWEST price that the guild masters will permit     the object to be sold for.  3) owner_pricing is the price that the donator wants for the item.  4) owner_pricing can NOT be lower than guild_pricing and/or guild_pricing.     If it is, then the price is defaulted to the guild_pricing.  5) guild_pricing can not be lower than the staff_pricing. If it is,     the guild_pricing is defaulted to the staff_pricing.  6) In the event that a staff_pricing has been set for an object, then that     is the default value for the object. It will be set higher if a     guild_pricing is set and is > than the staff_pricing.Eventually this train of thought lead me to the ovious question tho.Would you folks want me to expand this system and develope a centralfinancial system for PD ?? Making it easier for us to control and regulatethe flow of gold and items on the game.I need input on this system please. Would not wanna have to make drastic changeslater if i can avoid it :PI just need to know what level i need/want to design this system for :)Discuss it and get back to me by Sunday. That is when im going to be breakingground on the coding of this system.....Ironman"
