__Letter "I liked your stories, they were beautiful and well written. Please don't be mad at me but you know how I can get when I'm curious. I love you so much and reading those poems really showed me how passionate you can be. I also know some new ideas for romantic short stories to tell you now too. You should be proud of yourself, I loved those stories and I think I'll save them on my computer. I'll hide them though because I know you're shy and you wouldn't want anyone seeing them. I'm sorry I was such an asshole tonight, man I really screwed tonight up. And I know how you have to do that, \"Build a Bridge\" project with your friend but hopefully you find some time to get on here and talk to me/mail me for a little bit. I'll love you forever and always, I feel that you are the perfect girl and perfect one for me, I wouldn't give you up for anything, and that's a promise. I love you Simran, more than you'll ever know. But I'm going to go for now, I won't leave the game but I'll idle for right now, I'm going to play a game called Soul Calibur 3 with Will so he won't be so bored. *hugs and kisses* I'm so sorry that I was so mean...I'm almost in tears thinking about some of the things I said to you...and sorry for accusing you of hiding stuff from me *sighs* I really hate myself right now...Yours Forever and Always,Josh"
