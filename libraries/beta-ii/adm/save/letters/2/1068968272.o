__Letter "I miss you so much...  it literally sometimes takes my breath away.  After getting your mudmail I decided to clean out my mailbox a little (I had 200+ letters saved) and ended up reading all the letters youve sent me.  I ended up getting a bit emotional I guess.  *smiles and hugs you*  I think of you often, and still love you very much.                -Paul"
