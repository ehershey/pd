__Letter "How much do you know about combat.c?I'm interested in the possibilities that the while(xxx--){ death[xxx]->notify_kill(); } line brings up, but it currently only fires for PK's, not for normal kills, was wondering if it would be possible to move that over to normal kills too or not.Um, that part I mentioned is on lines 309-311 of /std/living/combat.cI was thinking this could be used for things like... kill an undead with a (specially coded fro this purpose) sword, and it raisesyour alignment, or, kill a balrog with a special mace and gain sp, and things like that, that would be interesting to do."
