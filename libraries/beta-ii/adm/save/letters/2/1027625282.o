__Letter "After countless dicusion with the members of my familly we have come to agreement that you shall not be in the familly at this time. This decision is due to the lack of space in the house and your lack of faith and passion for the idea of it.  I'm sorry to inform you of this, talk to me in about a month maybe we can make an agreement.~Relain Dra Machtig~"
