__Letter "On 14th of April around 6pm Melbourne Time. I was happily exping in Roston while partying with Byblos. Then suddenly a guy by the name of Centaur comes in and charged at me. It instantly got me to 600hp, so i panicked and slashed him 3 times as a self defense reaction. Sadly, that guy died and I was caught by the law and sent to jail losing all my equipment.Centaur, Galdur and Eios went to the shops and bought all my equipment and auctioned them off including the guild items. Then came Centaur + Eios and Centaur again charged at me in jail and slashed me a couple of times, I couldn't take it anymore so i went link-dead. Now I know what I did is wrong and shouldn't even considered it. But, I strongly believe Centaur is some forsaken's alt doing something shifty, maybe abusing a bug. Thus dying to him is not worth it. I believe he is cheating because his playing time is way lower than mine and Byblos. Which is quite low, since I have never idled and have been xping hardcore everytime I'm online. Plus with Byblos' mudding experience his centaur charge only dealt me 500 dmg, while Centaur a lvl 20 something dealt me way more. This is in account with the stats that Byblos got. So i suspect there is something going on, either he has been helped alot or been using a cheat.I'm writing this letter in the advice of Helena. I wish you to consider my situation and pardon me of my wrong doings since I was in a moment of confusion and panic and didn't do the things I would normally do.Tahngarth"
