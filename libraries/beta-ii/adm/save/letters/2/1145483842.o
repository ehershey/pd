__Letter "I'm a little unsure about the multiplaying thing, but the rest of it until the last two points I definitely want to post on the board :PFor those who think that Vyce may have been dested because we don't like him, in the 25-day period preceding his dest:- He was responsible for an average of 1 PK every other day.- He was responsible for over half the PKs not only in that period, but for 2 full months preceding his arrest. This means that for every PK that anyone else on the mud did, he also did one.- He was harassing a guild (and a specific member) with PK's. He told them that as long as that certain person was a member, he'd PK them whenever he could, and also posted it on the guild board:Message 29 by Myst: \"[deleted]\"=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=He died (April 3)All [guild deleted] are dying until they kick [name deleted] out of the guild.Message 33 by Vyce: \"[name deleted]\"=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=He's free game right now.[deleted commentary][name deleted], [deleted], [deleted], and [deleted]...

The basic message of it was \"PK whenever you can.\"- He may have been using alts to PK in law zones without getting a mark on his main character. This would be multiplaying. All kills but one with Vyce are in lawless areas. Most kills with alts are in law areas.- He has several suspicious kills within minutes of logging on an alt. He may have beenusing knowledge gained as Vyce to allow an alt to go PK someone. If so, that would be multiplaying."
