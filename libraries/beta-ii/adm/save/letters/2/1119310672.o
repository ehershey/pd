__Letter "I had theories?I'm just trying to understand the theories these guys have been putting out. If they would provide evidence, evidence that couldn't be explained by any other theory, then I'd probably accept their theories.The hard part is getting them to share the evidence. That suprises me, since if they really had proof of these amazing claims, you'd think they would want to prove them instead of telling us to find it ourselves, which so far for me has ended up leading to one BS/pseudoscientific site after another.Assuming there is evidence of his claims."
