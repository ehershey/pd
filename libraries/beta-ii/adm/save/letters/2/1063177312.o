__Letter "my post was mainly to the players it was aimed 99% at the players and their complaints about how im so hackless and stuff etc etc i know the admins have put in time and they have their own lives i have even said it before over my guild lines you can even ask my guild members i said everyone needs looking at but i know the admins have lives of their own it's gonna take time i also said that it's too bad that i won't be here for that time because i will be down south of australia i also said that i know that the classes and everyone else will be rebalanced cause you's (admins) said it would happen and i believe the only thing i was meant to point out to nightshade was dragonfury my posts have 0 punctuation and i don't usually make clear as to who i am refering to but my problem is that all the players keep telling me im hackless rara when i have seen some of them make it better with less effort i never meant to say that the staff of pd were at all lazy i know everyone not just me is waiting to be looked at i just want to make it clear to the players that cause i am so high it don't mean that getting up here was no effort as i am constantly reminded of "
