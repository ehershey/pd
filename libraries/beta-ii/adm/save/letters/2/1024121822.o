__Letter "To:LuciferSubject:GuildYou asked the reasons why I wanted to be in your guild. I am now going to tell you those reasons.In the guild description it says that in the Forsaken Guildwhere the masters are skilled in both physicall and magical disciplines. I am skilled in both, more in magic, but in both,I want to be in your guild because I feel I am good enough to be in it. Furthermore, I want to be in your guild because well I just want to. I mean like, I think that I'd do better here than I would anywhere else.Luv ya,Mochaprincess."
