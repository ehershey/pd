__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Cb to Amun Mon Apr 28 23:41:47 2008:-----could you talk to him.......cuz i dont know what the fuck is up his assutosaving.  Nulvect tells you: cb will continue to be gagged until you actually serve your  time being gagged... logging on, posting you're gagged, and logging right back  off is NOT serving the time  Nulvect tells you: and if I see another \"still gagged\" post, I will gag every  single one of your altskinda hard to serve time being gagged when you cant even send tells to people and not be rude by trying to respond to themand when your time has no \"time limit\""
