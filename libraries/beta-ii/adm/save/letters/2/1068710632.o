__Letter "Hi, I was just taking a break from homework and thought I'd stop by and see if you were staying up too late ;)  It's good that you're sleeping, but I always look forward to seeing you on.  How's everything panning out?  Have those doctor-types figured anything out yet?  If I dont hear from you in the next few days, I just might have to give you a call some evening *wink*  Tell everyone I said hi.                       -Paul"
