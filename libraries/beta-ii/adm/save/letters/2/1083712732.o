__Letter "Justin,I need your help to make the Ethereal rings query the guild position of a member. I'll elaborate more on that later.I also need you to add Ethereal to the list of guilds on builders, so we can test things better. The fly room needs to be updated a bit, Rhondale and Purgatory are not listed! :( Need the code to make treasury & storage room functional please. Oh, and we need to make sure we don't overwrite the lockers that are already in Ethereal... (or the treasury for that matter).That's actually about it. I hope that's not askin' for too much, we're almost done with everything now. We're just tweaking everything, and then we're gonna beta-test with some of the higher guild members.Then comes the hard part :) You implementing everything! When we're ready you can call me or something and we'll do it on the phone, that might make it easier, in case you have questions or anything. It's up to you. Anyway, I'll talk to you later, hope you're having a good day and all that. *hug*-JenP.S.Gonna send this mail via e-mail & mudmail, just in case one doesn't go through."
