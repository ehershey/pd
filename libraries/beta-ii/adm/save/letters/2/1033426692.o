__Letter "Rakshane House  (Protector)-My major concern with this house, is that I don't want this house thinking they have the \"right\" to      P.K. anybody they please.  It is there to protect those who doesn't choose this path.-Ask everyone who wishes to join, if they will be willing to protect the most obnoxious member of the  guild.  If they can put aside thier feelings, they are worthy enough to become protectors.-Like I said to you the other day, the protectors will be required to take the mark.  -Please encourage the Rakshane House to participate with the the Pavitra House Board.  I'm hoping that  Azire will get people coming up with quest ideas, or fun things to do.  It will help her out if she can  sense where the guild stands as a group on the ideas that float by.  I will encourage her to do vice  versa.-I'm pretty flexible on how you decide to run the house.  If you want to have ranks, or roles, etc.  Go  for it.  If you want them to do a mini quest to prove how loyal they will be, it's up to you.  If you  have any doubts just ask Buddah or myself, I'm sure we will back you up in any way you see fit.-If you have anything that will improve your house, more rooms, weapons, etc.  Please by all means let  me know.  I may not always be on, but I always check my mail and respond.  Just remember that each idea  costs money, so it might take time to fulfil a request, but it will eventually get done.-If someone from the Pavitra House has a stalker problem, the situation must be diffused on a timely  matter.  Maybe make some peace negitiations between the two parties or whatever you see fit.  You might  want to take this up with the house, I'm not sure how you want to persue this subject.>Well I guess that will be it for now, try not to have too many loose cannons join the force, they will be impossible to keep them from ruining the guild's name.  When other guilds see us, or other people in general, I would like to have the reputation of being a strong and just guild, not a guild everyone wants to p.k. or cause trouble.  We pretty much stand neutral in all matters outside the guild.  But if someone messes with the guild, I would like to send the message we won't stand for it.  Enjoy your new position, if there is anything that I can do for you, let me know."
