__Letter "I was xp'ing in the demon/angel level of the sewers.  Lupus sat in my room and attacked my angel, killed it, sacked it.  Then followed me and did it twice more.  I told him to stop he responded by saying there's lots more.  I said you're breaking the rules, this is my room when I'm killing the mobs in it, he said ok get out of my level, I'm trying to do a quest.  So I said I'm reporting you.  I have the log if you want it, it's too long I figured I shouldn't paste it in here.Teflon Don,."
