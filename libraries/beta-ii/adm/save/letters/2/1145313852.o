__Letter "he breaks both rules   a.) 'Harassment' is defined as the persistent targeting of one             Player or group of Players in a negative way, despite the fact   that the aggressor has been asked to stop.  This type of    behaviour is unacceptable on Primal Darkness and may result in    various punishments.                                                                        b.) 'Spamming' is a specific variation of harassment.  Spamming         is defined as the excessive repetition of information over any             avenue of communication, i.e. 'say', 'tell', 'shout', boards    and lines.  Spamming has no conceivable function other than to    annoy the Player population and it is considered to be    unacceptable behaviour.  he spamms the tirun [] when i am in it to annoy me, then check the harass log for what he says about it. i am tired of yall not even telling him to shut the fuck up."
