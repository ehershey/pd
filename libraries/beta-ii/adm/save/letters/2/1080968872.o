__Letter "As you know, Cookie resigned Ethereal yesterday. I won't get into that. We knew he was gonna leave and he did. So, I bumped evolution back up to Elite Panda (Leader), if you have a problem with this let me know. We're 1 short council member, and our members list is really unbalanced, which you know.. sort of gets on my nerves. Anyway, since I'm usually the one who makes the changes to our member's list, I decided you're the second most important leader in Ethereal (mainly because I'm the actual 'owner', otherwise you'd be ahead of me in experience anyway), so uhm...if you can think of anyone...the choice is completely up to you to make any changes right now to ethereal. Daos and I are friends again and so I suppose I will finally be able to make those updates you & I wanted, sorry for the long long long wait. The whole nightshade post about removing guild items completely freaked me out and made me a lot less active on PD to be honest. But I've noticed that my recent absence and sort of apathetic attitude toward PD is not good for our guild. So...make changes that you like, please please please send me any more ideas you have for updates, I'll be home a lot unless I'm at the doctors so I should be able to take care of things here now.Let me know, and take care.-Jen"
