__Letter "Several ideas have been brought up and a few that i found that would be quite intresting to see in use.1. make a guild shop or certain more useful guild items work for members up. That was there is a reason to not just stay as an initiate. but with that should come a quest or some sort of monetairy donation which leads to item two.2. There should be a quest or a monthly fee to be a memember. the fee, if we decided on such a thing, should not be a large amount i was thinking on the lines of 5-10k gold per month. just something to keep cash flow in.The couple things suggested above are just suggestions and please dont beat me with a flaming wooden spatula oh almighty sexy thing you... yeah...%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Endbringer."
