__Letter "Hi, my email is wyldflwr09@yahoo.caYou can add me as friend and some time, if you want, you canhear my voice.James has heard it tons of times and i've sent him pictures.Having 6 brothers - I am actually not comfortable doing guy alts onhere.  I may come on less as Stevo and more as female alts.  I justhonestly don't know what lingo to use and would rather say nothing.I also find the topics are uncomfortable when I'm on as Stevo.  I guessthey figure they can say what they want.  I tried doing the guy thing, but it just isn't working really.  I'll be on more as Jalen or Ayre.  HugsRayna"
