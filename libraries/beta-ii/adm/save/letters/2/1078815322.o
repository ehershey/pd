__Letter "Dear AzireIt fills my old heart with joy to hear from you.Azire...the world is turning... and this time i dont think myold bones will carry me though this turning.I also feel that this world is dieing, can you feel it?For my Queen i will stay with this world as long as i posess thestrength to carry my self. There used to be a time when i lovedthis world, and welcomed every new birth with open wings.Now all i can feel is hatred and distrust. Iam truly disheartendwith the actions of the smaller folk in the passing weeks.This is why i have chosen to distance my self from the worldbelow.I will rest in my inner sanctum. Where i alone have keept the walls company for many years. I do not dislike the fact thati am the only one of my kind, i find pride in it. Knowing thati alone must keep up the legacy of my race for years to come.Which is why i must take time out from this world, to keepmy self from making rash decisions. Which will nodoubt endthe legacy that is the Black Dragon.If you wish to drop in and say hello, i will allways have my caveopen to you, my queen and my light in this time of darkness.Yours Faithfully    Orcha"
