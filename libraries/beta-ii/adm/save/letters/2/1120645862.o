__Letter "I understand that as a friend you wanted me to see what you were saying about me..so that you were not talkin behind my back.  I appreciate that.  HOWEVER, what I do on this mud and what Stacey does on this mud is our buisness.  As a guild leader I understand that I should try to stop furiae or myself from saying certain things, BUT it is not your place to tell us how to act.  It really bothered me that you talk in secret to illisse about us.  1- Illisse doesn't know SHIT about what is said on this mud other than what is on boards, b/c she is never on.  2- You dont know SHIT about what is said on this mud other than what is on boards, b/c YOU are never on.  I understand that your work schedual is the way it is, and I understand that you can't be on as much as I can...I COMPLETELY understand that Paul...but as an EQUAL guild leader you should not tell anything like you did to illisse.  She is trying to IMMATURLY go behind our backs and start shit with you, and that is NOT something I value in a person.  If a person has a problem with me...fome to my fuckin face and tell me...dont go crying or tattle telling to an EQUAL leader.  B/C the way it sounds, she thinks you are higher than me, which you are NOT; and it seems she is trying to get you and me fighting.....what fuckin person does that?  SO my request to you is that you do NOT talk about me to anyone in that manner, it is disrespectful and shady...and it is NOT something a freind like yourself should do.  Thank you.Samantha"
