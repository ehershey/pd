__Letter "Hey, I know we have had problems with Kabaal, but I got an mudmail from Kajjul telling me he is cool with me pking Kabaal last night (I had mudmailed him telling him I had done so).  So... Unless he threatens you like Kabaal, I think we should just take it easy on Kajjul.  Under no circumstances do I want to PK him or have him PKed. He's in our guild.  If worst comes to worst, Needleboy and Dagmar will pay him a vist. Also, talk to me first before doing anything, tonight.  Catch ya, manTonights the last night of work!-Nate"
