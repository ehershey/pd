__Letter "I don't actually use Windows, but...Is it booting like normal?? Not into safe mode or anything??You should check out your display settings under control panel and try settingthem to something medium, and turn off extra eye candy (like window transparency).If you've downloaded _ANYTHING_ recently, run a full virus and spyware scan.Make sure you are fully patched, unpatched machines can get owned in a matter of minuteswith no user input required.Check your router/switch/whatever with only gmud running:Does the light blink only right as gmud displays some text (when it's going slowly)??If so, it may be an issue with your tcp settings - I know one of the older patcheshad a problem like this (XP SP1 I think??). Just run windows update. If that doesn'twork, you might try deleting your gmud install completely and reinstallingto a new folder.Keep in mind gmud is really old, so you may want to just try a different mud client...Hope something there helps."
