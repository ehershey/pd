__Letter "Truly remarkable! Paging through the book, you find what appears to be ameticulously kept journal of an exiled angel named IlithydAs your eyes scan over the crumbling paper, a story unfolds. Ilithyd describesthe demon Asmodeus, the foul one; who tricked the Gods into believing ill ofIlithyd.Thusly exiling him to Distopia. The journal goes on to describe how Ilithyd setup residence in this very house, his plots to prove his innocence to the Godsand his ultimate desire to return to the heavens.Pages and pages of sketches, notes, plans... All becoming more confused,jumbled.. Even the script, which was at first clear and crisp - now blurstogether...The entries, more scattered.. It quickly becomes impossible to find any sensein the later entries.Throughout the entire journal, even the jumbled bits .. One theme remains true.Ilithyd must have hated the woods to the south of his home.The journal states repeatedly that a demon had taken up residence there amongstthe trees, and the foul being was determined to taunt Ilithyd for the rest ofhis days.Paranoia clouds many of those passages as he rants on and on about the demon'staunting behaviour. Everything that goes badly is blamed on the demon.As you flip to the last page of the journal's stained pages, one strikinglyclear passage is printed.I cannot stand any more of this foul demon's taunting games! I go tonight tothe woods, to end this. To slay him. I will bring his head on a pike back tothe heavens! That lowly servant of Asmodeus's .. Then shall I be justlypraised.There is nothing more written."
