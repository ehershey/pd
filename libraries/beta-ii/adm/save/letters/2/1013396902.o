__Letter "This is the reply I got from the other system admin, the one who helped us set up the account:Hi Tommy, the scripts that I wrote and put in place are the only measurethat can kill processes based on ram usage (unless you intentionally setuser limits via ulimit ).  These scripts also email me, and they haven'tbeen, so you haven't even reached your 40 MB quota (since last night,anyhow), so whatever is causing your crash is not part of the systemstability/security.Plus, the file /home/pdark/mud/libraries/beta-ii/core  is pretty recent,soyou may want to look into that.Hope that helps you find your problem. Stormy"
