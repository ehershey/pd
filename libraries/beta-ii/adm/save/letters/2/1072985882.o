__Letter "Hello,   It has occured to me that Army of Darkness is suffering from poor Leadership. the supposed owner of the guild has cided and the other members mostly dont care.  I wish to rebuild AoD into a great guild. However to do this I need to be the owner of the guild. So when you can find the time I'm asking if you could give that too me. Thank you--The Dragon Rider, Gob"
