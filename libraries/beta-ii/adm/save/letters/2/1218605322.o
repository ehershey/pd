__Letter "At the end of the event, we're going to want to close off the dragon lands. The room descriptions for dragnorth08 and dragnorth09 include two great rock gateways, which serve kinda as a welcoming post and a marking point. for the dragon lands. Maybe we could have those gateways be where the passage is blocked off?Also, I'm going to have to sign off on my area. I just cannot do the item descriptions for them, every time I sit down to do it I feel that I would rather drive a nail through my skull. I'm so tired of area building."
