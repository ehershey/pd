__Letter "Trip to Cedar Point, eh? Going with the SC crew, or on your own?And the trip to Ohio- to visit family, or for work? Do you have any idea what it's like being as curious as I am? Every time you send me a note, there are a million questions that pop into my mind. :)I sent you a letter - I got the IM on Trillian... Can't remember which ID it came through to (I have lappy on \"Naptime\" right now)Check your post.comI only hope that, when I'm not in dreams, I live up to them. :)I remember kiting when I was little... I always loved the feeling of the string tugging me upwards, like I was some stubborn little weed :)Read you mail :)-Heather"
