__Letter "Well i sent you a message but I doubt you'll get it. I figure mudmail is more reliable :pToday was such a slooooooow day. I missed hanging out with you! Oh well. I did get 3 skills maxed (attack, rage, ferocity) and now my coupe does 1000 damage to players. That's pretty good right? *grin*Hopefully I'll get to talk to you soon, if not, you're definitely seeing me Monday! (you don't work til the afternoon right?)*huggles and licks and everything else teasing you love* ;)Heather"
