The logged off. Jekhar wasn't aware of my  presence. His player (I won't name him for obvious reasons) knew because of another character being online (Gromph) in his house. Now gromph wasn't a willing participant, he was used, however Jehkar was acting on out of character information when he logged on his char. From what I can tell this is Multiplaying. How be it not in the classic sense of the word.I'm not going to deny that I would love to see Jekhar dested. But then I know him irl and he is to put it plainly, a Asshole, his main reason for playing is to jack up other players when the oppurtunity arrises. I'm not trying to tell you what to do or anything. And any decescion you make is fine with me, I'm just letting you know the facts.However I ask you please to contact me and let me know what you decide at least. Or in fact discuss it with me if you'd like. Even if it's a stop whineing your wrong, I'd like to hear a response.Anyways Cya later on :)%^BOLD%^WHITE%^)%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^BLACK%^Solar%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^WHITE%^(%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^BLACK%^ Halo"
