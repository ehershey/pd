__Letter "A friendly mail politely asking him to please stop questioning elathius. No commands or threats, just a request.I don't remember being told to have absolutely zero contact with players, I am turning off all lines and blocking tells now.The fact that he brought it up with you, or another, and said that I told him to do something probably means he has something against me, especially since it is soulfly/ancalagon.I am not welcomed here already, and I have been considering suiciding the character anyway, but I'd rather help out.I'm sorry I can't get on but I am using a friends computer at his house until I can get $1000 to get replacement parts to fix my computer. - Aziraphale"
