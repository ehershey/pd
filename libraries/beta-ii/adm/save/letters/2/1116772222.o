__Letter "hey stormy, i was trying to find the builders port and logging on an old character i thought i had as a builder and used primaldarkness.com port 5001 and tried logging in kabaal and logged into the mud with smokey on at the same time. it was an accident, both chars stayed in their seperate halls and i logged off kabaal as soon as i realized what was up. i do want a builder, though. i have a good area in mind that is highly needed for chars 60-80ish. please mudmail me back about any info you can give me about becoming a builder. thanks.smokey"
