__Letter "Hey man, ok so I dont really know if you knew, but I used to be a demon antipaladin.. I went kataan and got to lvl 36, got my skills maxxed.. I havent changed any of my stats at all since I remorted, I'm really disappointed with the kataan class, and i'll probably never really play dubbya again. Which kinda blows cuz everyone either likes him or is terrified of him, he's a reall fun character to play. I know it's like pretty much unheard of, but do you think there's any way you could change him back to an antipaladin? I worked so hard for months statting him as a fighter, I just dont wanna remort again and lose all my hard work. i'd be better off just starting a new character. If there's any chance in hell you could let me keep my stats and go back to a lvl 1 fighter it would make me soooo happy :)I understand if you dont wanna, But if you do, i promise i'll never ask for anything like that again...pleasepleaseplease make my char playable again :P I highly doubt any of the players will care, I get a lot of positive messages from newbies and players in general talkin about how cool dubbya is.. you can make him cool again! the mud will love ya for it! :P"
