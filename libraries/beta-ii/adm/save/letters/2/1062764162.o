__Letter "May I work on Illuminati? I plan to change it all around, fresh start and all that. Add new stuff and make it all nice and proper.I had a look at the directory as it is here, and it's *all* messed up. I dunno what happened there but armour, items, mobs, weapons and rooms all got heaped into the same directory. The portal is trying to send you out to where the square used to be. It really is messed up.So, I'd like to just work on this stuff in my directory, and hopefully keep it there since I dislike the fact that imms can look in those folders. I have nothing against Hermes if he can look through the code of the guilds and relays info to friends, I expect that kinda thing, I'd just rather keep the guild stuff I make secure, since I usually put alot of effort into it. Like I did with the spheres.Anyway, I hope this can bypass the 'no applications for guild stuff' notice in \"help guild addons\" - Since I'll be making everything myself, it'd just need a walktrhough. Don't worry, I won't just add instant heal and give exp for free rooms or items, no portals to places you can't fly to. No portals to merk. I'll follow all the rules. No weapons with WC over 10.Hope I can move on to this since I think Rhondale is done for now."
