__Letter "In most circumstances something like this would be delt with by a mail, but in this case it involved many people and a guild of people therefore I chose to post it on the guild board. You only have Evolution to blame for it going on newbie- I offered him several chances to have it posted on only Ethereal, even after he deleted my post (knowing I would post it on newbie because I told him so), even taunted me, egged me on (\"Post it, then, I dare you\", \"Well I'm waiting\") and now that choice was made, it cannot be undone; and it was made by him.This is PD business because it concerns PD staff, and the only thing pathetic I see here is the code. As I said in my post it was small minded and pathetic. I am disappointed that Evolution could be so small- I expected better.You did not ask me for my help, but I am not an immortal at your beckon-call; your code was clearly unbalanced, and by design or not, I had serious problems with adding it to players port. To simply say, \"We will have it checked later, we want it added NOW\" is not good enough in my humble opinion, and your confidence in my coding ability notwithstanding, I know a powerful item when I see one. The other immortals back my observations- I am simply the most vocal about them. I had many things going on while I was trying to impliment your stuff, including IRL and Mud distractions- I was hardly focusing until I managed to spot a few things. I was hardly at my best, and I had had a *very* busy and *very* hard the previous night, which did not help my mood at all. I was not in the mood for fixing code, so I just gave Evolution the errors to fix. It was his code, after all. And as far as I'm aware, I made one misreading mistake, not 'lots'- I had a mental blank and just misread the code, something I instantly recanted after it was pointed out to me. I'm only human, and as I said, not at my best.I do not make threats. I state facts. I said that if I chose to post the post back on Ethereal board, which was my *privilage* to do so, and that if he attempted to remove it I would deal with it appropriately- by imprisoning him. To say, 'You are hereby forbidden to post on Ethereal board' is rude, and just plain incorrect. Fortunately I am a reasonable person and provided an alternative, which has already been discussed. You didn't like the outcome, and I warned Evolution you and he would not, but he proceeded anyway.The posts will not be removed."
