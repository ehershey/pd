__Letter " This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years.  The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. The noise would wake his wife  and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.     Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off  because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and  that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor; she was  concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.    The years when by and he continued to rip them out!    Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinnerand he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where  she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare  parts and a malicious thought came to her.   She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep  and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the  elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his  shorts.   Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which  was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps  as he ran into the bathroom.   The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the  floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she  had got him back pretty good.   About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained  underpants with a look of horror on his face.   She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He  said, \"Honey, you were right.All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to  you.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked his wife.  \"Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out,  and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and  these two fingers, I think I got most of them back in.\"  Stormy"
