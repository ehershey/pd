__Letter "Alas, it seems that things are working against me. I just found out today that *both* my mom and my dad are off from work tomorrow. So sadly, i won't be able to spend time with you.  :'(  I guess just treat tomorrow like a regular day; don't get up at a special time for me. I shall see you when you get on that night, rather than you getting up and me very possibly not being on.*sigh* And i was so looking forward to nearly the whole day with you...Well, for now i shall stay on another 5 minutes or so, and then if you are not up by then (i don't really expect that you would be up this early) than i shall be back on again at 7. I love you dearly,Your princess,Heather"
