__Letter "That's fine what he's doing, but he can make alts to determine which class he wants. He's had characters way beyond 19 and he's played many variations of characters. He should have a feeling by now what he wants out of a character here. I can see the disgruntled members points of view, and maybe he'll pull his head out of his ass and either stick with a character in the guild or maybe he should leave the guild until he's content with a class. Trust me, I've partied with him on alts and he is actually a good friend on here, but there has to be a line drawn somewhere if people are getting irritated.Smokey"
