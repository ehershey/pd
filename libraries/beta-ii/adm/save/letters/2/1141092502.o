__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Summer to Summer Mon Feb 27 21:00:00 2006:-----I had a big huge all out fight with ironman today. i am sorry that it was across lines and such but it had to be done. He completely insulted me and treated me like some 2 year old. Amun was also on then so if you need to know if i went to far please talk to her. I don't take to anyone insulting me or talking down to me. I also talked with daboura and i don't agree with some things he said. i hope i get a chance to later add or convience someone to add it in the game. Hope to see you later. (and really hope i am not in THAT much trouble)-Summer"
