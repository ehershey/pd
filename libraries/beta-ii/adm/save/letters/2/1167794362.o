__Letter "For starters, the owner of PD, as far as I've been told, is Stormbringer. What gets me is how you can say you are \"rather apathetic\", yet you take time out of your life to post these political links on PD and on Merentha. You have not demonstrated political apathy whatsoever. And I may be wrong, but I don't believe I called you an \"uneducated idiot\". I merely stated that there are too many uneducated idiots running around touting there bullshit uneducated opinions. If you are going to take offense to a comment like that, then maybe YOU are the one calling YOURSELF an uneducated idiot. "
