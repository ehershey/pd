__Letter "Hi, I'm back from my trip.  Talk about a lot of stuff happening.I found out that several membersof my family were going on the trip, sonot much time to myself.  My family had arranged it for me and there were10 of us who went.  I was going to email you from the Tomorrow landpodiums, but they were refurbishing parts of it and the computers weredown where you send messages.Will tell you more about it all later.I came home to find out that my nephew passed away on January 3rd,he would have been 1 year old on the 4th.  We were all devastated, butthe family here wanted to wait until we came home, because there wasn'tanything we could do.Miss you tons and wished I could have talked to you.  I'll be on later,but wanted to let you know I was back.Hugs, xoxoOh... and I had written your number down to call you, but I didn't havemuch of a chance to get away or explain who I was talking to, becauseI always had someone with me...  :("
