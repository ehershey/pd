__Letter "Thanks...and really...Losing gold wouldnt hurt, and being wrong doesnt hurt either...Enlightening yes...But hurtful no.Personally however...I did expect the worst, im not exactly poster boy here after all :p, but i was wrong...And im glad i was wrong.  And all apologies to Daboura for ever thinking wrongfully in this situation.  And that can be passed on to him as well, if wanted.  Cause it is sincere."
