__Letter "Saw you died a few times.  I expect you think I'm going to tease you or offer a sarcastic comment.Nope, I'll just say I'm sorry.  It happened to be on the very same day, believe it or not.  The Golden City can be a very dangerous place.  Although I heard you met your death at the hands of Rob Zombie.  Don't feel bad, he's one of Stormbringers little nasties I hear.In any case, good luck on regaining levels and maybe if we can call a truce to any possible PKing, we can team up and get some XP back?I will PK you someday, out of honor of course, but don't take it personally and it won't be coming any time soon. I will give you fair and objective warning three days in advance from the day I think I can take you.In any case, good luck with your levels.-Hermes"
