__Letter "I sent this to Stormy, too.  It's just an idea I've been thinking about a lot.New idea: Role Playing characters and normal players.Role playing characters would have bonuses and weaknesses.  Some of the bonuses would include being able to participatein monthly events in which the story of Primal Darkness wouldunfold.  This is a rare treat for role players.  In addition,in some cases where a player is faced with a lot of counts they feel they didn't deserve, they can have a court battlewith the person who feels they should die for their crimes, the judge being an NPC controlled by a random staff memberwho wishes to resolve the matter.On the down side, in a role playing situation you can't reallysend messages instantly across the world.  This would mean nolines of any kind, no tells and acting in character completelyunless you were posting on the message board.  A RP characterwould be deleted for breaking any rule without a 'warning',unless the situation was proven to be some sort of misunderstanding.Strict interaction rules between RP characters and normal players would need to be made.  This idea basically separatespeople who want to see PD grow as a story and world from thosewho want to PvP (player vs player) and chat.Potential RP finger info:(A RP character's info would be disguised somewhat, since theymight wish for their character to be revealed through RPing)                             %^RED%^ /\\			     %^RED%^/  \\                            %^RED%^/  %^YELLOW%^* %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                           %^RED%^/      \\                          %^RED%^/ %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Primal %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                         %^RED%^/ %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Darkness %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                        %^RED%^/            \\                       %^RED%^/              \\                      %^RED%^/ %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^(%^RED%^player info%^CYAN%^)  %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                     %^RED%^/   %^FLASH%^ROLE PLAYER    \\                    %^RED%^/                    \\                   %^RED%^/                      \\                  %^RED%^/    %^BOLD%^CHARACTER NAME      %^RESET%^%^RED%^\\                 %^RED%^/   %^RESET%^[%^B_WHITE%^%^BLACK%^Test            %^RESET%^]     %^RED%^\\                %^RED%^/                            \\               %^RED%^/                              \\               %^RED%^/                                \\             %^RED%^/%^YELLOW%^*%^RED%^        %^BOLD%^AGE %^RESET%^[%^B_WHITE%^        %^RESET%^]          %^YELLOW%^*%^RESET%^%^RED%^\\              %^RED%^==================================              "
