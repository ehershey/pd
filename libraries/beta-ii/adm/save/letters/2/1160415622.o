__Letter "I was going to talk to you about the post on the save system last night but something came up and I was unable to come online.  The reason why it has not been completed yet because I was told to hold off until a new justice system was created by Stormbringer.  The new justice system was to be made with the concept of the save system to help prevent possible player abuses with the save system and the law.  If you would like I have talked to Stormbringer and he is too busy to create a new justice system.  I would like to ask you if you would like to take charge of creating a new justice system.  If you do keep in mind what I said about the making it compatible with the save system.  If you have any questions dont hesitate to ask me :)Whit"
