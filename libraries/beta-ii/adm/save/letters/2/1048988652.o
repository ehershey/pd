__Letter "Thanks stormy, and i'm sure it's oodles, coz i don't know how much i lose when i die, i don't concentrate on how many stats i have or how much xp i spend on skills, that isn't the way i play the game.  I know there are loop holes in my idea, i just would like it so everyone is comfortable and it's not like i saying that they can't pk anyone, so i can't see why anyone else would want to block it.  It's not like it's going to effect them except for the fact they can't wreck someone elses fun.Wisp"
