__Letter "KataanOk, as you have seen with wizard, and as I am doing with druid, I want one single color designated to their spells. I was thinking with kataan, their spells could be all black, and all their physical attacks would be red.I need 3 under level 20 spells. I would prefer these be just spell attacks.Then I will need around 6 20 and above spells. They can be any mix of physical and magical attacks. If you want to set up a combo between some of them, feel free, just keep in mind they both have to be weakened to equal around 1 attack. These will all be direct damage attacks, but the number of rounds it takes to land the attacks is up to you.I will need 4 para spells. I want 2 of them to be short duration paras, used for initiating combat, pehaps the first one would be a 1 round spell, and the second one could be a 1-3 round para. The other 2 can be more long term para spells that can't be used to initiate combat, well they could, but it's not as good an option. Perhaps the highest level para could be a short duration area para, like 1-2 rounds so the kataan can escape.There will also be 4 debuffs. I have no real preference as to what they debuff, but keep in mind kataans are evil, and their debuffs should reflect that.  Perhaps the highest level one can be an area debuff. I would like for there to be combos between the different spells, but I leave it up to you to decide how to do it.These are my guidelines, and if you have any questions about them, let me know."
