__Letter "Hey stormy,I wanted to talk to you about my old chars, I had an old char named Tai,I really just wanna remake this char, My nickname is Tai so i do have some sort of wierd attachment to it, could you pls lemme remake him?Also, and i know i am way out of my league when i ask you this, but would i also be able to have Yang restored, the night i cided him i was going through alot.  I am currently joining the army and my whole family is against it.  They tell me if im that foolish then i prob should go out and get blown up.  I havent talked to my side of the family in a few months now.  But thats besides the point, If you cant then thats kool, but if you can, all i can say is ppplllleeeeaaaasssseeee....Thanks for your time Stormy"
