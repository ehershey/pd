__Letter "For your information, all that was done to cure was to fix some bugs it had. It only heals as much as whatever healing skill you have. As for other things Paladin, you will have to wait your turn. That goes for angels as well. I am working on things, but right now life is very busy and other things in the mud come first as they are the changes needed most. One other thing, I do not appriciate you using profanity on my lines when I am not here. I see it again and you will not like the results. I will get everything done eventually but not everyone will ever be happy because things ae not done their way, they are done mine. All I can say is, if you truely do not like the way I do things perhaps you should check into doing your own mud, not that I want you to leave or anything, I like you and enjoy having you as a player, but balancing everything to be fair to everyone is a very hard thing to do. Everyone wants to be a superpower, everyone wants to have uber everything, and it is not going to happen on my mud. I have a list of things to do and oldest gets done first, If I do not work fast enough for you, I apologize.I do read the boards and I know your are pretty upset with paladins at the moment. I will work on them, I know they need work, but their are other classes/subs that need more work and that are harder to play right now. Same goes for angels and demons. As for dragon their day for rebalance is comeing too. This letter is getting long, but I thought I should write you since everytime I get on and check what has been going on, I see you on the lines voicing your opinion the most, which is a good thing, but mailing me those opinions or posting them woud better get it across to me ;)Stormy"
