__Letter "yeah - things are going downhill swiftly. i'm deep in work and paralyzed by panic ... I'm skipping classes to get my work done today. Its too draining for me to do both right now, and that's not good. I'm planning on going to the CVA main office today and having a chat with people there - i am terrified that the panic attacks are going to keep me from succeeding. I miss you very much - i'm checking out your title now. ^_^ -Jenna"
