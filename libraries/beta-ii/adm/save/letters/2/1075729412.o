__Letter "I think they have bugged up with their breathe ability. They are fire dragons here rather than red dragons, which means that they don't use breathe when they should. Also, because they are over level 50, I think they are trying to breathe, it is initiating combat with the trolls, but then because they aren't red it doesn't work. (meaning it can't find which type of breathe to do so it does nothing). They used to be a bit buffer than the trolls level-wise, and they had an exp bonus for using abils. (like +50% exp?)"
