__Letter "I have asked Nulvect to check out the new senses system i built.He said that he will experiment with it when he has time.The system is fully functional now. All we gotta do now is testit and tweak it to your tastes.No response from Whit yet tho. Hopefully he will look it over too.Just let me know when the review process on this system is farenough along that i can let some builders start playing with it.i'm going to leave it between those with archwizards only untilyou give me the nod to show the system to the builders. Onlybuilder i may draft to play with it is Old. She helps me fromtime to time when i got new toys to play around with :PIronman"
