__Letter "Well, I have Wiz calling me and telling me you want PD back, although I never knew you had lost it. Real life stuff creeps up on everyone, even me. I was told, by wiz, you want to host Pd again and take charge of it. Then when I was hesitant he acted like I am doing something wrong. I am just protecting PD, the staff and the players. I gave both you and Wiz enough access to build, debug, create whatever and I think that is enough access for now, if you prove active and contribute then a move back to admin is not a problem. I wont promote you back to admin though if you have no plan on being active and making things for the mud. In my mind, no one owns PD, we run it, we are the caretakers of this mud.I know PD would not be here without you, Inferno, Detach and others. I know I would not even be a part of this place if you had not had the trust in me to help run it. For that I thank you but at this time I see no reason to remove the mud from it's current host. It is stable, runs fast, and is well taken care of it where it is. I hope you do become active again, your input is greatly wanted, always has been. You have a great knowledge of the codebase here and great ideas.I don't know what else to say, I just want PD to go on being active for years to come and as things stand right now, it looks like it will definately make it for a long time. We have a great staff who were all players for a long time and know what needs to be fixed and balanced and they are working through the code at a good pace. I hope to see you around and talk with you more about this.See you soon,StormyStormy"
