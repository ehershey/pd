__Letter "I was just pressing \".\" to send the mail when my computer froze and I could not get back on to pd.The mail was too long or something, so it won't work in mail. I have the text document I used to write it though.\"http://home.austarnet.com.au/pd/report.txt\" is where I stored it.Hmm, seeing the url reminds me of what else I got stored there. There's some hella funny pictures of us there. If you wanna laugh I can give you the URL's since I don't have webpages set.I've slept since I wrote the first mail so I don't remember what else I wrote. The notepad is a backup from before the computer crashed so if there are some parts that aren't very good then that is why.Yeah, it's really long, so yeah, sorry to take up so much of your time, I know it is really important.	- Aziraphale just woke up"
