__Letter "Sorry I missed you.  We kept missing each other.  I know it is difficultto connect, especially this time of year now.I am hoping to get some James time Saturday evening if possible forus to be online together.  I am watching the weather so I can go over to Vancouver to see my Dad.He'll be at my brother's place, so it will be easier to visit him.I miss him a lot.  I know you understand just how close family can be,especially when my Dad was like both parents to me and a great fatherto us all.  I'd be lost without him, he's unique, fun and an inspirationto us all.  I guess being his only daughter, he has a different bond thanwith my brothers.  I miss you too, I hope we can talk online Saturday evening providingeverything goes my way.  I should be home alone that evening, butwill know more Friday.Take care of youCause Rayna misses James/Axenos/Dragosani and all the otherfine characters that make up that James guy hehehugsxoxo"
