__Letter "Wanted to drop a quick \"hi\"... So... hi. :)Played Euchre tonight with Kent. Had a lot of fun :) Lately, we've been playing Gin. That went until earlier, when I trounced him in two sets straight. :) Neither of us had played Euchre in years, so we played against the computers. Was fun. :)Um... Aria says: Mrrrrrr. Blrrrrrllll. Mrrrowr. Whatever THAT means :)Hmm. Have a meeting first thing tomorrow, and another at 9. Then another Friday. Been thinking a lot lately. I guess we can chat when we catch up. I'd like to know what's going on in YOUR life?Sleep well-H"
