__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Resolution to Whit Sat Jun 10 19:57:44 2006:-----I dunno but I have noticed a distinct lack of active admins and imms lately. and honestly have next to no use for daboura and his attitude. Thinking about it I thought of a couple players that could potentially be a huge benefit to the mud, and help it out immensely, however they can be a bit controversial.Nulvect- He knows a hell of a lot, and could be of great use in workin on classes and such. He was smart enough break down both the xp system and the stat cost system for all races and classes. He knows a lot more about the mud than many people that have came and went as admin etc. He could be beneficial if given the chance. and he is pretty well liked.Carina- Now i KNOW she is VERY controversial and very outspoken and bull headed, but her area coding has been pretty good from what i have seen. Perhaps an immy that codes new areas and stuff, as she really does love coding. Just thought that maybe some player input would be of use to you admins and imms. I know it isn't always appreciated so I tried to do my best in keeping it nice :) thanks for your time and effort, it is greatly appreciated.Resolution"
