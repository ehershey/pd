__Letter "HI!!! Heylo Jard, what's happening? ^_- sorry that I seem to have missed you on PD... I was soooo hoping that you'd be online when I got to the computer. Bt alas, to no avail. I think of you often , and , being sakura time here - miss you a lot . i'm on telnet, please excuse the horrid typos. >.<  ... Japan is such an odd mixture of 80's kitsch and cosmo glam..... junked in with backwater and traditional ways that go back ages. @_@ I find myself really liking it here.. Its refreshing to be a complete wierdo in a society that is structured around conformity.  There are maybe 10 foreigners here in Kagoshima, a city of nearly 1 million peopole. that'll give you an idea of how much of a spectacle I am when I go out. its cell phone pictures and autographs when I go to the grocery store. hah. japanese. go firuge. I hear the winter has been innteesting... how have you been???"
