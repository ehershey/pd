__Letter "Oh, how i hate for that to be interrupted. But i understand. I hope your dad doesn't fuss at you too much. :( We *will* finish what we started. I am still going to bed early enough that i can get up quite early for you. I shall attempt to wake at 6 am my time. I hope to find you there when I arrive. From then I should be able to be on most of the day, up until about 1pm when i should get a shower and start preparing to go out for the night. Until then, live in the moments we *did* have tonight and save that thought for tomorrow (or actually later today for you).With utmost tenderness and care,Your Princess,HeatherwhoBah, ignore that. i forgot i hadn't finished the message yet and typed \"who\" to see who was on. Haha. :)"
