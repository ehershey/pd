__Letter "  I got the idea for this article, when I was reading the Tirunboard. I had been sick for awhile, and when I returned, the board wasfilled with almost 30 posts about a certain dragon. Talking abouthow he is as some put it, annoying, childish, and immature. I believethat in some ways these things are true. Because if he really wanted tobe the bigger person in his \"situations\" he should ignore them, butinstead he persistently argues on a childish level about some of themmost idiot things I have ever heard. No, I do not think it is all hisfault, some people just don't have to patience to deal with people likethis certain dragon. Vampira"
