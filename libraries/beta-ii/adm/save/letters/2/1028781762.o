__Letter "I pked your friend, today.  Just so you know it had nothing to do with any real life thing.  Darksouls does NOT like him and paid me a million gold to do it.  If they had wanted you dead I wouldn't have done it as you're in AoD.  But he was not.Just so you know, if you feel mad at me, I can certainly understand.  But also know I did not take his stuff and offered him 200k of the bounty to make up for the lost XP. He did not take this.In any case, I do not apologise as it's not on principle, it was for money. and it was all IC.-Hermes"
