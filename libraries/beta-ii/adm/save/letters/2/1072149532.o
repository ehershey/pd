__Letter "here's the actual message:Hi, Jenna.  It's been kinda a crazy weekend...  While I was travelling back to MI, the person who I was riding with informed me that my friend's wedding was this sunday, as opposed to next sunday.  So I was running around trying to get ready for the wedding as soon as I got home.  I was in the wedding, so I had to be at rehersal and everything.  My sister's friend is getting married this upcoming weekend, too.  I'm older than both of the couples.  It's kinda discouraging...  like I'm missing my time.  Makes me feel old, too...  feeling old wouldnt be much of a problem for me normally, but when I got home my mom showed me a letter my dad sent and he told her that he was having massive kidney failure and was given about 4 weeks to live.  He said he didnt want to bother me with it...  so now I'm feeling old, my dad is dying, and he doesnt want me to know about it.  *sigh*  I'll give him a call for christmas and ask him how he's doing and see what he has to say.  Anyway...  so what have you been doing now that you've finished the mural?  Today I mostly slept, recooperating from driving all night then doing wedding stuff til sunday night.  Have you finished your christmas shopping?  I havent...  I'm going shopping with mark on the eve *grin*  I know what I'm getting everyone for the most part.  Hopefully I'll see you before christmas...  if it's ok I might give you a call then ;) take care.             -Paul"
