__Letter "Dearest Arial,I have been on many adventures, but the other day, you missed one of the greatest adventures. There seems to be a new land, far on a reef in the sea. Many dangerous creatures there. I fought a nudibranch, which poisoned me, but I was able to get cured from my sapphire ring. That really came in handy when I needed it the most.  I have missed you and I hope you are well.. we will go on an adventure soon, dear I promise. Love, Empyrean"
