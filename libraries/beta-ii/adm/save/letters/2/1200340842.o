__Letter "Dear Noelani, I have been told you are a beauty unmatched in heaven orearth. Having been to both, I am more than captivated. :) I like to helpothers and bask in the presence of beauty. As such, the sooner we meet,the better for me. :D I shall be on the lookout for you. If you are onetenth as beautiful as I heard, I would forever be blessed by the meresight of you.Best regards,Uza"
