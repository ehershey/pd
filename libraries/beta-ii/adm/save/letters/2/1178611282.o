__Letter "Humm.. where to start...I removed Aeval from the guild a long time back....I dont remember when exactly or why I did it, I think Ijust did it.It dont matter to me that you married warrick, it dont phaseme at all. Though for \"RP\" etc etc, its a cool thingthat should i get a chance, i can pk him for some reason :PI know you wouldnt tell people about forsaken.I have a lot of trust in you on that.umm..as for me pissing off the whole mud. I dunno about thatone. Am pretty sure I havent.She said I was being annoying? fair enough, I have been talkingto her and shes not said much. Ah well, Sam has been twofaced from day one so i couldnt careless what that womanhas to say about me to you.It dont phase me, so I hope it dosnt upset you.As for Rohl. I got him for you. Ever since that fkerPked you, I have been waiting and watching him and desipitethe fact that he keept on saying that I would never gethim. I got him.If its going to become a guild war or what ever, i dont care.I'll simply out last them and eventualy i'll get anotherone of them.But yeah. No reason to get all fired up, am chillingand havent changed much at all. Dunno what Samis all on about, but its got nothing to do with me.Hope your well.Nathan"
