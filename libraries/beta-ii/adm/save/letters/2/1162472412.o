__Letter "Hi my friend. How nice surprise is see GREAT improvements atbuilders port. The new security system is very good. The olderold had alot of holes. The head command still has a small hole,we can see the first 20 lines of some deny files. The cp hasa hole too... but i cant remember the point right now.Please check is everything is ok with my builders char calledOld, im feeling too much locked, unable to see the docs andtemplates files and cant cd into allowed dirs.Mind block? Yes and no. Im full of imagination for sure butis hard to think in logical/math ways to code properly,maybe cuz the medications... or i just need time to removethe rust at neurons cells.Anyways i saw the PD board about active builders and here Iam!Dont erase me. :P *bites your nose*Kisses,-MM-"
