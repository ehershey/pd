__Letter "Just spit balling here but i was thinking if u are all buff and maxed out there is nothing special but a remortPlus the bomb spells you gave us i think mindprobe is awesome, save i cannot cast it on people within no-magic areas.I was thinking, That a big enough charater should be able to like  'challenge lodos' if it's accepted then lodos will go on high alertie diff mobs better xp. just something different u know, kinda like the setlong(night/day).i think you can do alot with a feature like that given the proper builders.anyways i'm gonna head back to killingthanks for your time and thanks for reading...Enigma."
