__Letter "Hey there. Unfortunately my dad is having problems getting the router to work. It's sounding like he'll have to start all over again. so more than likely i won't be on tonight like i said i would. I'm so sorry. I wanted to, so much. But oh well. Hopefully this will all be worked out soon and I can actually spend some time with you instead of just talking to you through e-mail. Speaking of email, though, I read your 2 e-mails yesterday, but i didn't have time to respond to them. I'll try to respond either today or at school tomorrow. Until then, happy mudding and cya later. I'm really looking forward to seeing you. :)Eilistraee"
