__Letter "Tijir, :), Don't know if you remember me, but i used to mud here WAYYYYYYY back in the day, when Joey and Seeker never used to be idle, and i'm also Marius.But my question, is that I used to have a dragon but i've forgotten his name, and i really would like to start playing here again, (ii recently joined the air force, so i was tied up with boot camp and tech school and iraq, and that whole ordeal, but i was also Armand from merentha, im sure u remember me :)I'm just asking if theres any way u could somehow find a list of all the dragons made, because I'm 100% positive, that if i saw his name again I would know who it is.  And I'm also 100% sure that i would remember his passwd because ive only used a few in the past 5 years.Anyways, Thanks for the help, and I hope you can help out an old friend. Thanks.Armand.Marius.Marduk."
