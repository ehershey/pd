__Letter "This is to balance out the Raknid Paladin problem. Raknid slash + boost is too strong by a good bit. Balance for this is to remove slash from paladins altogether and give a cut to their blade skill (4 per level) and boost to their blunt (6 per leveL)There new main attack will be maul. Here's what that code will look like. I changed damage and stun components of it.attack = this_player()->query_skill(\"attack\")/3 +this_player()->query_skill(\"blunt\")/3;attack += this_player()->query_stats(\"strength\")*3;attack -= ob->query_stats(\"dexterity\")*2;attack -= ob->query_skill(\"defense\")/3;The stun component looks liketotal = random(this_player()->query_level()*2) + (attack);if ((total) > ob->query_skill(\"defense\")*2 + random(300)) {This makes maul a little more likely to stun and it also serves as making it more stat based. A level 50 with 100 str will be doing around 400 damage to a mob with maul. Bear in mind they also get a large ammount of normal attacks for damage, and they are primarily a defensive class with their advatages of boost and cure and smite and so on. The stun and their other abilities makes up for the lower damage.If wanted the damage could be upped, but I recommend leaving Maul as their new main attack and getting rid of slash from paladins. "
