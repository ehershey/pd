__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Nightshade to Pyro Mon Nov  3 12:52:03 2003:-----I looked at your harass log.  and sugarcandy's.  Needless to say, I wasnt impressed by either party.  I'm not going to do anything about it, but if I were, you'd be who I chose to be punished.  not only did you start the argument, but you were more insulting throughout the ordeal.  Stop.                      -Nightshade"
