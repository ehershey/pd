__Letter "Here it is, my argument, basically.  I'd be happy to talk about it.WHY THE EXPERIENCE LOSS AFTER A PVP DEATH NEEDS TO BE REDUCED*This does not apply to death in player versus monster/environment/etcYou are possibly wondering, after having read this title, why the experience loss from PVP (player versus player) death should be reduced at all.  The mentality of the average mud player, after having played and survived one for any lengthy amount of time (assuming that mud has PVP) is often in support of tradition.  Aside from the bragging rights, considerable PVP death penalties provide players with their own means of policing each other to an extent.  But in a game with rules where the staff are equiped to penalize players who have commited notable dissobedience, why is it at all necessary for players to be able to police?Primal Darkness is a game with a small, comfortable player population.  It has recently been asked “Why do we have only [small number] of players in the player base?”  There are many reasons but one that sticks at the top of the list is that the community is very established and unmaleable.  Most people are friends with each other.  The community is naturally clustered together because it is so small.  The only thing a new player has to do to be black listed by the entire mud is to upset one high level player.  Why?  Because of the power in PD's player policing.  It is so great that no one will ever stick their neck out to protect the new players, because if they get on the black list themselves, well, their character can be broken down piece by piece.One argument against the change, presented today, was that PK death penalties create interesting conflicts, where the oppressed player must train themselves tirelessly to become better and get their revenge.  After doing that, they can theoritically fight their way into the community's praises.  This has yet to happen on Primal Darkness (to my knowledge) and is a reason why people wont play here, or have and quit.  For the tireless training method to actually work, a player has to be a 'hardcore gamer' (someone who spends a lot of time playing the game) and know how to gain experience in the most efficient way possible.  Hardcore gamers are a minority in the MMORPG world.  The bulk of players in online worlds have various responsibilities in their lives and can only contribute a certain amount of time to gameplay each day.  With PVP death penalties as harsh as they are, this can easily erase a week of work for a casual gamer.  This is a quote from an ex-PD player who left because she was randomly killed, taken from AOL Instant Messenger: “Well when I was killed it negated everything I did for a week”.  Just imagine that for a second.  If the majority of players can have anywhere near that amount of their time taken from them in one death, and are 'black listed', they can be set back to square one after a few deaths from players that are connected by the community, and this has happened on Primal Darkness a number of times—the spirit of anti-harassment rules can easily be destroyed by the combined efforts of a few players.  The previously quoted victim felt like crap, for lack of better words, and left.That is probably how a lot of players feel.The problem here isn't the fact that our players are so closely knit people.  It's that they have too much power over anyone new to the community.  If new players are a lot less damaged in being killed by other players, then player policing will lose it's bite and PvP will probably come closer to having a purpose: notable guild wars and the angel v.s. Demon war might actually resemble, oh, say...  wars.  But most importantly, players will be less afraid to have different opinions and break the cluster up into pieces so that new players can join in it's units.  A GOOD REDUCTION:Reduce the experience, level, skill and stat losses by 90% per PvP death.  Equipment should still be lost for the most part, except if any form of item insurance program were to be coded. x"
