Here it is. :)describe stands before you, the ideal %^CYAN%^syn%^BOLD%^er%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^gy%^RESET%^ of %^RED%^%^BOLD%^might%^RESET%^ and %^YELLOW%^magick%^RESET%^. His %^BOLD%^diamond-hard scales%^RESET%^ change from %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^black %^RESET%^to a %^BLUE%^%^BOLD%^deep blue%^RESET%^, each one the size of a %^BOLD%^tower-shield%^RESET%^. You gaze upon the razor-sharp spines like %^BOLD%^blea%^RESET%^che%^BOLD%^d b%^RESET%^one%^BOLD%^s%^RESET%^ which shine in stark contrast to the scales. His spines %^MAGENTA%^tra%^RED%^il%^RESET%^ up to his head, adorned by %^YELLOW%^two mighty horns%^RESET%^, twisting forward and up towards the %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^sky%^RESET%^. Orcha's head arcs towards you, %^CYAN%^freezing you%^RESET%^ with his gaze. He grins and slivers of %^BOLD%^silver teeth%^RESET%^ glint menacingly as you feel his %^RED%^%^BOLD%^intense%^RESET%^ scrutiny. An %^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^arc%^RESET%^ of energy leaps bout his mouth and fizzles out as he opens his jaw, exposing hundreds of sharp scythes. %^BOLD%^Fear is death.Do with it as you will or not. :) Yobbo wears it if you wanna see it without making a changeYobbo!"
