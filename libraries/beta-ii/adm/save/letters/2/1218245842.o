__Letter "basically im thinking of it working like this.Each rune would contain one of two functions. Either rune_hit() orrune_heartbeat(). Now what would happen is the runes get moved insidethe weapon. Once there, function_exists() would check for the functions inthe runes and act accordingly. rune_hit() inside extra_hit() affects duringcombat. rune_heartbeat() for those going off during heartbeats ( healers ).As for saving and recloning the runes, this is fairly simple ;    1) inventory the weapon    2) then (string)*my_rune_files to store the list of files.    3) within the init_args(), clone the listed filenames and move       them back into the weapon.It would allow the runes to \"stay\" with the weapon thru autosave and allowthem to hold their individual functions.Things that boost a stat/skill would just accumulate on the weapon and nothold the two functions i named. Hence they wouldn't be called in extra_hit()or heart_beat()."
