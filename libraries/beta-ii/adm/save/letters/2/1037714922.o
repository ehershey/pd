__Letter "Heya, there was a bit of a melee going on in the arena the other day and I noticed some things.Firstly, again I notice that as soon as backstab hits, a rogue can use stab. Rashka hit me with a backstab and 4 stabs at the same time, not good.Another case of ability stacking, Rubicante was able to use a couple of abilities at the same time. In the first round I was hit with Dakzhul, Hellfire and Massacre. And then after that every round a hellfire, and every second round hellfire and massacre.I also noticed something that seemed busted with holyfire. After I cast cure or peace I can't cast holyfire for another 2 rounds.I wouldn't pick it up except that it doesn't happen after paralyze, and I can still cast lifewarp and other attack spells the round after (1 round later, rather than 2).An idea I thought would be nifty is being able to use \"holyfire all\" that hits everything in the room. I just thought it would be cool since to hit everything in the room as it is you first need to \"kill all\", giving your opponents a free round on you. Especially annoying against 50k+ monsters where I will need to peace/cure straight away and then that gives them another round of combat where I can't do anything.OH yeah, \"holyfire target\" doesn't kill a monster until the end of the round after it reaches 0 hp. This also means the monster can get a free round on you. Again, I wouldn't note this, except it used to kill them straight away, and then suddenly it didn't anymore.Finally, is holyfire at the right amount of damage? I dunno how good Rubicante is, but I have over 400 faith, 100ma (alot for cleric) and 40int/wis, yet I don't do much more damage than his vortex. I would point out again that to get holyfire I need to reach level50 twice, and archangels/demons don't get any really good bonuses for their sacrifice. Additionally, people have been remarking on how good swipe is, apparently it's pretty BS, but I dunno.I hope the same arguments again don't annoy you. Oh, and using abilities as Rubicante does I don't think is bug abuse, I dunno why I mention, just don't want anyone getting in trouble is all. %^RESET%^CYAN%^*** %^BOLD%^WHITE%^Prator %^RESET%^CYAN%^***"
