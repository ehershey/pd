__Letter "Sorry I didn't respond, I read your mail then got pulled away from the mud.I can't remove your gag though, there was a reason for it and I can't play favoriteswith rules enforcement... the good news is it's on an automatic timer(which shows at the bottom of score) and it will remove itself afteryou spend that many minutes logged in and not idle.Well, if you ever come back, that is."
