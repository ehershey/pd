__Letter "Fri Aug 13 03:12:06 2004 from TsukeTo: Azire Subject: Read Me PleaseHi, I am sending the mail as I would like to get a message across to the bothof you. After you have read it, then you can take whatever action you deemnessercary, in terms of the game, or real life.Firstly I would like to say Grow Up to the both of you. You are both behavinglike 16 year old (Or perhaps younger) spoilt brats.Secondly I would like to add some points directed at Venenum. David, you needto stop thinking with your dick. You have got a possibly bright future in frontof you, but only if you start using you head. Also, if you wish to become abastard, cunt, arsehole, whatever; then fine, it's your life, thats yourdecision, but consider this, if you wish to pursue this line, then consider ourfriendship ended. I Will Not Associate myself with those types of people, asthey only get themselves and the ones around them into trouble.Thirdly I would like to direct some points to Azire. You, as mentioned before,need to grow up as well. Yes you have problems in your life, who dosn't. Butyour problems are NOTHING compared to some of the things david has gone throughin his life. If You really wanted to end this, then you should have acted likean adult and fixed it yourself and not brought someone who had NOTHING TO DOWITH THE SITUATION into it. Are David and Carmen so hard to talk to now? Are wenot allowed to act as good friends should and stand up for David? I think youneed to have a good long hard look at yourself and your actions Azire, and howit affects the others around you, Ones Who Cared about you.Lastly, as I am guessing about what will come of this mail, If Either of youhave any problems, or want to discuss this mail, then come and talk to me.These are My Words, My Opinion.  -- Dane Thomas. Severing more friendships."
