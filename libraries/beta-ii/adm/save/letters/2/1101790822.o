__Letter "Hey guys,I left ownership of Unholy with Furion and just recently found out that Daos removed the rights and transfered them to Set without contacting me at all.  I totally agree with the rationale for adding new leaders while I couldn't connect, but I still feel that I should be owner of the guild.  It's my baby.  I'm not trying to get rid of you, you're doing great jobs and I don't intend to step on your toes at all, but I want ownership back.Basically I'm just asking you to get Daos to switch ownership rights to me.Thanks,Leviathas"
