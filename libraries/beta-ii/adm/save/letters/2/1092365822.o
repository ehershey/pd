__Letter "Venenum tells you: And how am I supposed to treat you then, hmm? I have beenfriendly to you, if not as friendly as I was before. I have given you spacewhen you needed it. I have gone to you and asked your opionion, because Irespected your judgement. I'm not 'out to get you' or delierately trying toupset you or talk untruths about you to other people- I am simply trying toimprove. I'm not upset about what you did anymore. I posted that in my journalages ago. I am now simply trying to prevent it from happening again, as it hashappened to me before, and will continue to."
