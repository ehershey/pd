__Letter "The problem that I was having apparently stems from the fact that add_exit() and remove_exit(), among others, call init() in each room.I think we should create a new function, one that is guaranteed to be called once and only once, when an object changes its environment, after all other functions are completed. I seem to bump up against init often, and I have to try to create work-arounds for it every time I want to do something more complicated than some sort of add_action().For example, if I wanted an object to remove itself if it was given to a non-wizard player, I couldn't put it in init(), as init() assumes that the object still exists after the function is completed, and throws errors if this is not the case.Furthermore, I believe that with the instancing system, people will want to create functions to be called when a player exits the room. I couldn't use init(), as you saw, and I just had a lot of difficulty trying to create my own custom function tying into the redirect function, as the function was called in the original and not in the clone. Of course, I will be making a workaround for myself right now, but I don't think you could expect builders to do the same."
