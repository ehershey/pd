__Letter "hey, first off I how you are doing well.  Second off I wanted to talk to you about becoming an imm again, and an admin on builders.  I was just going to let it go until you talked to me about it, but the little brats that keep coming on and spamming PD and now builders as well as a few people asking me to do something about it struck up my thoughts about it againas you know yesterday someone came on and spammed posts and mails, well today \"Imback\" came on and did the tirun board.  Tirun Board < 874 Unread, 998 Posts > is here.Me being the Tirun Mayor I was able to help out and clean it rather quickly, but I feel I could have avoided this if I could have arrested him or banned him, since as of late not many Imms/admins are on, save nul who's even been scarce as of late.I would love to be able to help and make things a little more easier and not so hectic when you guys come on.  Please let me know what you think.Carina"
