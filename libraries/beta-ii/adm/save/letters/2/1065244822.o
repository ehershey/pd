__Letter "Could I have 3 custom rooms built for me and my alts, I've listed the descriptions below. It would also be nice if they're in the same floor.ROOMSRashka's RoomYou walk into the resting room of Rashka the Slayer. Intricate patterns are seen weaving across the magnificent ceiling. Shiny armour and swords are hung on the walls. Various paintings of the woods are here. You notice a large picture on the south wall.  It depicts a brave weimic slashing his way out of a circle of ogres warriors. That must be Rashka!ObjectsA large treasure chest. (Maybe i could store stuff in it and only i can open and close it)Aethar's RoomA sense of holiness is present in this room. The walls seem to be made of the highest quality alabaster marble there is in the realm. Aethar's private collection of holy books and statues of famous monks lined the sides of this room. You feel you don't deserve to be standing in this room of holiness.ObjectsDonation pool. (People can throw money into a pool and the money goes to Aethar's bank account :P)Barrin's RoomAs you walk in, a set of fireballs whizzes past your head. You barely escaped the fire trap. You stand awestruck by the sheer brilliance of Barrin's study room. It seems some arcane enchantment is present here, as this room surely is way too big to fit in the tower! Half finished artifacts are still scattered across the floors. Spellbooks and scrolls covers nearly all of the desks in Barrin's study quarters. You think to yourself, this guy must be a bookworm!. You decide you should be going now before stepping into another spell trap.Pool of Seeing. (a scrying object)"
