__Letter "I have set up the ability for builders to be able to snoop eachotherif and ONLY if they are in a party together. I will also be adjustingthe /std/user/move.c so that a builder can not enter eachother'srooms other then workrooms without being in a party together.I did this for 2 reasons. One to allow builders to be able to traineachother. Two to add an additional level of security by preventingbuilders from walking around eachother's areas without the coder'sconcent.Only issue i have, which i will be investigating how to solve, is anactive snoop continues to run if a person leaves the party. We needto figure out how to make the snoop end when they leave.Ironman"
