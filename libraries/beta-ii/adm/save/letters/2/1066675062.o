__Letter "I was just wondering...  have I done something to upset you?  Or have I worn out my welcome so to speak?  Since you've gotten back, you've been busy, which I understand, but you havent said goodbye when you've left or anything like that.  I'm not quick to pick up on things, so that's why I ask.  Anyway...  I'll check back later to see if you're around.                  -Paul"
