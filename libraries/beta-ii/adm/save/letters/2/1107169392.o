__Letter "The guild is still bound by the 5 day rule.  Since you are the leader of the guild, you are responsible for all members and their actions.  You can only PK a single player once per a 5 day period, even if they PK you back, the rule is not void in that instance.  You can file a harassment log if the player continously PKs you."
