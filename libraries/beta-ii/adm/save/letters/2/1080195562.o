__Letter "This occured today.  I am not stating a complaint of harassment nor am I in any way upset with the events that have been logged here for your viewing pleasure.  However, I would like this to serve as proof of unprovoked attack on my person by Kumi.  The newbie log is not complete, as my screen moved too quickly before I could get it all, but the entire conversation is logged to its entirety.  Please note, if you decide to check my log with the mud's logs, that I had not spoken to Kumi until provoked (line 8 of my log) and even then I issued two warnings (though I do understand if the first was not specific enough).  The second log bellow is a conversation I had with Bellos after this little incident and have logged as proof of no harassment on my part towards him.  He has agreed that he is not offended and even seemed quite pleasant about the entire ordeal.  Anyways, this is just to be proof that she has been warned, that I am free from any wrongdoing (I say this quite hesitantly because it seems I'm always doing something wrong), and that... Ok, well I lost my last point but bleh, its 1:17 AM and I still have 100+ pages to read for a test tomorrow and 5 more pages to write for this stupid paper.. so urm.. yeah.. thats my log!<newbie> Sugarcandy smacks Bellos, and Blits (just because his name looks likeBellos') and anyone else within arms reachBellos <newbie> well...  yea...Kumi <newbie> he would die.Bellos <newbie> shouldnt have hit meBellos <newbie> rule of return.  so im done.<newbie> Bellos leaps into the air, to continue the bloodshedKumi <newbie> how is it idiotic that he hurts you after you hurt him?Sugarcandy <newbie> Yes, words cause such pain.Sugarcandy <newbie> Kumi, don't speak unless spoken to, thank you.Kumi <newbie> sorry, i'm not going to comply to your \"request\".Kumi <newbie> if you're going to refer to an action he did that was similar toone you gave him previously as idiotic, then you should look in the mirror'Sugarcandy <newbie> No, I'm serious.  For harassment purposes, unless I speakto you please do not speak to me.Kumi <newbie> uhKumi <newbie> it isn't harassment if i respond to things you say to me.Kumi <newbie> sorry.Kumi <newbie> i'm in no way being rude.Bellos <newbie> <newbie> Sugarcandy smacks Bellos, and Blits (just because hisname looks likeSugarcandy <newbie> Hence the \"Please do not speak unless spoken to\" commentSugarcandy <newbie> Please think before you speak.Bellos <newbie> you hit me.  so, stfu, and deal with it.Kumi <newbie> you first.Kumi <newbie> you're talking to me right now, sugarcandy.Bellos <newbie> thanks you!  and goodnight!  the king has left the building!Kumi <newbie> therefore i can continue talking to you.Kumi <newbie> :)Lac <newbie> im still here bellos :|Aldur <newbie> THE NEWBIE LINE DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY!!!!!!!!!!! goodnight<newbie> Kumi farts.You tell Bellos: lol im not even upset with you hon.. if i wanted to be mean iwoulda used something other than smack :)Bellos replies: i still had just reason to knee you.  someone hits me, i hitback.  rule of return.You reply to Bellos: yeah.. its coolYou reply to Bellos: reason i said it was idiot is because of the groin commentYou reply to Bellos: im a female.. so groin isnt the best choiceYou reply to Bellos: :)Bellos replies: eh...  you never have been kneed there have you >:)You reply to Bellos: im in a bitter mood.. i dont mind playing around but imust say that if you're going to compete with the big dogs.. you're gonna haveto know how to bark back :)Bellos replies: it hurts women too.  there is a nerve in the groin for bothmale and female.  it hurts more for males only because of their testes.  whichare more sensitiveYou reply to Bellos: oh yes.. i have.. i played softball... i've been hit quitea few timesYou reply to Bellos: sweetie.. I understand that.. however for a purely rpingstandpoint.. groin isn't the best choiceBellos replies: meh.  if i wanted to rp, i'd just slit your throat.  but i'drather not kill...  swift.Bellos replies: no offenseBellos replies: intended mind youYou reply to Bellos: lol no.. its perfectly fine. you see on the lines I rpmostlyBellos replies: i rp as well.  i rp as i play.You reply to Bellos: so if it doesnt follow within the lines of the currentmood im rping then i just insult it and move onYou reply to Bellos: anyways, we have reached a mutual understanding to theslap then?You reply to Bellos: no hard feelings i meanYou tell Bellos: or.. are there hard feelingsBellos replies: no.  im damn near impossible to offend, or to get on my badside.  just dont try.  being on my bad side is \"very\" unconductive to acharacters life (rp)You tell Bellos: well you see i have to be sure not to offend anyone now a daysYou tell Bellos: because certain people choose to actively harass me and i mustbe extra careful that i dont cross the line with anyone at any timeYou tell Bellos: for the record however, this conversation has been logged inits entirety and will be being sent to NS as a complete record of what hasoccured today.  Nothing will happen to you, I just need to be able to provethat I didn't somehow permanently damage, scar, offend, destroy your innerchild, etc. By emoting a smack on the line.You tell Bellos: Do you agree to the above statement and accept that while thisconversation is being used as proof of my innocense it will not be used againstyou in any form?Bellos replies: sure.  but im loggin it too in caseYou reply to Bellos: that is fine, i can send a copy of my complaint (againstanother, not yourself) and log so that you may check it for completeness?You tell Bellos: did you want a copy of this?Bellos replies: noBellos replies: no need for itYou reply to Bellos: just making sure.. have to cover my butt in everydirection these days :)You reply to Bellos: btw, I do hope to look forward to exchanging wits with youin the future, you tend to be more interesting than some.. though i must saythe groin threw me :)Bellos replies: in battle, brute strength alone cannot win a battle.  You needwits and tactics.  one tactic is to decieve the opponent.  let them make thefirst mistake.Bellos replies: words to live by.You reply to Bellos: i'll take that for a yes then :)Sugar"
