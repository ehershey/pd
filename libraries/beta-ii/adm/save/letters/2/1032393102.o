__Letter "Yeah, I really screwed up today...  I had stopped on for a few to see what was going on, and Wisp came on, so I went to her to see how she was doing.  She was a little surprised at the marriage, but was ok with it.  She gave me a hug, and I hugged her back, but then I typed 'smile azire'.....  I guess I just had you on my mind, as usual.  She went linkdead after that.  I mailed her an apology.  I just wanted to let you know what was going on if she mentioned it to you.  oi, I can be a dunce.  *sighs and hugs you tightly*  I'll be on tonight, perhaps a little late (Lots of homework due tomorrow).  I love you.                                        -Your Paul"
