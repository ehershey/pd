__Letter "every time i type quit, i lose ALL my inventory. when i log on again, all my autoload stuff, everything is gone. i've tried this several times with various eq and quitting out and each time my whole inv disappears. is this a bug maybe? and, i know you've said on the board that dont ask for eq back, but this is not the case of quitting out during link-dead so would i have any chance of getting some of the more valuable stuff i lost (eg black diamond)? thanks"
