__Letter "Hi, sorry I couldn't get back on, was having some family stuff going on.I have to go to Vancouver today with my sister-in-law and kids.  Thenwill stay overnight there, some family stuff going on.  Will be backSunday night.My Dad and I decided to just have one main line in house and I'll geta cellphone.  It's been an ongoing discussion and it was the same aboutthe internet.  My Dad likes the quiet, so he could at least turn off the mainphone, but I'd have to do it more often if I had one in my room.  At leastwith the cellphone, I can adjust the volume, etc.  He's very easy to live with, it's just when I'm out, he likes quiet.I guess it comes from having 7 kids in the house and then when the familycomes over, he enjoys the silence afterwards.  heheSo, I'll see you tomorrow night, unless I get talked into staying longer.I hope not, would like to talk to you more.Your Rayna"
