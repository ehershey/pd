__Letter "HeyaJust curious. What's happening with vampires? Cause I would very much like to be one. I don't care what I have to do Quest wise. I've just been reading a bit to many books lately and have got a real woody for vampres at the moment :P I gather the Race/Class exists, however unbalanced it may be at the moment. Is it just the quest that needs doing? If so I volunteer for the Job if only to get them in so I can change to the darkside >:) Rest assured that the Quest wouldn't be shabby. I'd hate to have it easy. Cause that would defy the purpose entirely, coding wise I always have Prator on hand for questions, albeit carefully worded ones as not to give anything away, Or of course one of the admins should they be available. It's just that I've managed to reach a fairly stable section of my life at the moment and I was looking to do a bit more coding. Alot more actually. Anyway I'm just rambling now. Let me know what you think. If someone else is already organising them then that's cool. Good news for me :) But otherwise yeah I'd be really interested in doing it. Let me know of any thoughts, comments, abusive put downs ect. :P%^BOLD%^WHITE%^)%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^BLACK%^Solar%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^WHITE%^(%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^BLACK%^ Halo"
