__Letter "*Prator takes a deep breath.*Yes, I suppose I will see you later...It will take me a while to deal with this, I don't have anyone else to talk to.It is quite a bit to take in less than a day.I don't think I have been this sad before.I think...I think I will need to talk to you.For now I am just going to go and, nothing. And just do nothing.If I am idle when you come on, just send me a tell, I always check to see what happens while I am away.Goodbye."
