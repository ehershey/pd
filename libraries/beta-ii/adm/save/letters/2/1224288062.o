__Letter "not sure if anyone has asked about this but i'm going to anywayshas anyone ever thought about bringing in fishing you could sell the fish or cook them to help with sp hp or mp and if you are in tough area you could pull out a mob that will auto attack you.i hope it is making sense to you because this idea just popped in my head and i didn't want to forget itand the longer you fish your skill for fishing will go up and less chance of pulling a mob out.the mob could be like a squid or somethingand another ideacraftingdifferent crafts can make different things i know ranger can do this with skining the corpse but you could make armour and maybe i could say who it was crafted by but some crafts will fail due you need to skill up your craftjust a few thoughts that popped in my head thought i would sharethanks for your timeFury"
