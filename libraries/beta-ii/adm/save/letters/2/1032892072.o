__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Rubicante to Stormbringer Sat Sep 21 16:54:13 2002:-----I like that new move addition. Great idea for fighters.Little overpowered if you ask me tho. In arena i took 1.7k from a coupe de grace while i was at 75% life (780 hp). That would be much higher vs a monster. Once fighters get the timing down vs mobs they will be extreemly fast to kill large mobs. For example If i charge + slash + slash and the coupe as charge hits i'm sure i could kill a 50k mob at lvl 50 no problem in 3 rounds. Maybe a requirement of the mob/player being at a certain percentage of health would help (30% maybe). This would keep it from being too strong for killing mid-sized mobs or players and it would also help a bit when people get the idea of using coupe in forbidden forest/cavernsjust my toughts-- AshPS - I like how paladin's dont get it. makes some differences in subclasses which is niceStormy"
