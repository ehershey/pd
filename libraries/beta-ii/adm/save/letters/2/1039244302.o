__Letter "With my new position as Script Archon, I thought it would be appropriate if for my first edition of 'Azzy's Corner' to be one of my favorite poems. This is an excerpt from Lord Byron's \"Stanzas for Music\". Enjoy! 1       There be none of Beauty's daughters2         With a magic like thee;3     And like music on the waters4         Is thy sweet voice to me:5     When, as if its sound were causing6     The charmed ocean's pausing,7     The waves lie still and gleaming,8     And the lull'd winds seem dreaming:9       And the midnight moon is weaving10       Her bright chain o'er the deep;11   Whose breast is gently heaving,12       As an infant's asleep:13   So the spirit bows before thee,14   To listen and adore thee;15   With a full but soft emotion,16   Like the swell of Summer's ocean. Original Text: Byron, Works, 17 vols. (London: John Murray, 1832-33). PR 4351 M6 1832 ROBA. George Gordon, lord Byron, Hebrew Melodies (London: J. Murray, 1815). B-10 3742 Fisher Rare Book Library (Toronto). "
