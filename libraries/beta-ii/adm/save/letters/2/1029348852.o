__Letter "earlier this morning everyone was talking about dragons.  Imentioned the quest probably leaked and Daos said that the haunted house questreally wasn't all that hard to solve.  And, unless I miss my guess, the huantedhouse is where you become a dragonThis is a major problem Daos. It does not matter if 90% of the mud knows exactly how to become a dragon, you saying what the dragon quest is, is a serious problem. We need to talk about conversations you have with players about class/subclass as well. None of the staff should ever outright say a class/subclass sucks, ever. Which, I see in my buffer, you did.Stormy"
