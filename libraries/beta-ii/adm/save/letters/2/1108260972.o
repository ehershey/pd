__Letter "Nesoo,I have this really cool idea.  Cool to me, anyway.Ok, so it involves fighting your target.  You can choose various fighting styles...The first obvious fighting styles to me are 'lethal' and 'non-lethal'.  I think it would be cool to incapacitate someone, down to like 1 hp, and have them paralyzed there for a while...  maybe unconscious?  Incapacitated people could be picked up and moved around.  Although this could result in people moving them into agro mobs to avoid the criminal penalty, perhaps the incapacitator would be responsible for their death for X amount of time afterwards.Ummm, and fighting styles could have something to do with damage output and cost.  Especially for physical combatants...  like hand to hand based players could reduce or increase their exertion, doing more or less damage and costing more or less stamina accordingly.  It would be great for having more fair battles with opponents of lower levels, and great to 'giver' and go all out against a tough foe, exhausting yourself in the one battle.What do you think?Levi"
