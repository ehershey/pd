__Letter "Sorry, love. I fell asleep during our conversation last night. Iwas super uber tired. So much so, that I attached a buzzer to gooff each time you said something, then I'd read it and respond.But, apparently, I didnt hear the last 4 buzzers.:( I should'vesaid something but I didn't feel ready to let you go yet. I wasgetting greedy for Rayna time, hehe. :) When next we speak, Ihope to be far more coherent and with it. :) Sorry again, love.I hope you had a good night.All my love,Your James"
