__Letter "Not that you care, but I found a way to poke a tiny hole (hopefully) in my mom's pagan ways...I recalled today that she was worried about this herbal \"remedy\" because it called for a lot of St. John's wort, and that herb is apparently a strong one.So, I strung together \"St. John's wort\" and cancer in a google search... ended up getting a lot of hits that claim that St. John's actually interferes with chemo medicines... some of them even \"complementary and Alternative medicine\" pages! Needless to say, I used one of those as the first link I sent to her (so it would be some one on \"her side\" who was arguing against it). Anyway, maybe this will make her the tiniest bit more skeptical in the future? I can always hope...And here I figured I'd get 50 difference \"recipes\" for cancer \"cures\", heheSpeaking of this, do you know any sites that \"hold your hand\" and explain in a nice, calm, reasonable voice why this stuff is bullshit? I'd like to move her in that direction, but I think she might be a bit put off by, say, the JREF/Randi."
