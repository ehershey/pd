Somthing happened about us having to many guns or something so he d/c all of us and had us come backHere's the thing, when i came back, all my no al'in items were gone wich is understandable but everything i had in my pack was gone to, that was my aling [D [D [C [C [C armour and such, I don't really remember what all i had but i know i had more than 2 items. If there was any way we could try and get em back that would be sweet.If not it's not the end of the world, i just don't want it to seem like i'm trying to get a bunch of stuff i didn't have, it was all low lvl stuff mabye we could try n figure it out.Thanks for you time and any help you can offer."
