__Letter "IM not sure whats going on here but the new characters are stuck in the creation rooms.I followed the login.c code through the steps and seems ok. I just don't getwhat the issue is here.Right now the only files that call my Simulefun is _more.c, _ed.c and _cp.cI even tried removing the Simulefun from SimulEfun.c and rebooting (withcommenting out the 3 lines i put into the commands) just to make sure it wasn'tmy alteration.... Please check this issue and tell me what is wrong so i canwatch for it next time.Ironman"
