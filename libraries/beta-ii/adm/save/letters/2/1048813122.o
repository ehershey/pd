__Letter "Thanks for the offer, but part of the reason he pk'd me was to raise the anger level in some people.  I've always told people not to avenge my deaths, there is no point. i just wanted my stuff back and to move on and i pretty much have that, i have 2 special rings back, Faust has given me a diamond so i can xp and he rezzed me, i just need 1 level to get back to where i was, so all i've really lost is 2 diamonds (which i can buy) and my respect for him *shrugs* no big deal anymore.I've had a number of offers, i'm just not going to play his game, but it's good to know people care and that's the reason i'm hereI've had a number of offers, i'm just not going to play his game, but it's good to know people care and that's the reason i'm hereoops*hugs* ThanksWisp"
