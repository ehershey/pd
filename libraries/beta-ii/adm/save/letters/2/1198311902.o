__Letter "Hey sweet lady, I was stuck in a dormitory tonight and therefore, myfate was not in my own hands. I got relieved late, then went to getsome food and do a little shopping at the 24hr pharmacy. I got somecologne that Russ wanted, Cool Water. It was super cheap so I caneasily afford to get him a little something else. I need to headback pretty soon, but I just wanted to rop you this message. I domiss you, too. Very much. This weekend, maybe I will get my Xmaswish and get to talk to you. :) Only time will tell. :DLove ya,James"
