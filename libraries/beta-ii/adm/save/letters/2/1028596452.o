__Letter "You need to make every exit in the room like this..Autosaving.add_exit(\"direction\", \"filename\", (: function :));And then function should be defined like..uhh..int function(){if(!present(\"crystal\", this_player()) return notify_fail(\"You fail to pass through the forcefield.\\n\");if(present(\"crystal\", this_player())->query_uses()==0) return notify_fail(\"The crystal does not have enough power to lower the fields.\\n\");write(\"The crystal glows as you pass through the forcefield.\");present(\"crystal\", this_player())->add_uses(-1);return 1;}Of course, using the query_uses/add_uses requires you to add the following lines to a basic object.int __Uses;void add_uses(int x);int query_uses();void add_uses(int x){__Uses = __Uses + 1;}int query_uses(){return __Uses;}That SHOULD do it, however, I just wrote this in the last 5 minutes and haven't tested it, so, if it's buggy, tell me and I'll try to fix it."
