__Letter "I discovered an issue with the mapper daemon...It uses strip_colors to disregard the color strings when creating buffer size, that works as intended. The problem is, it doesn't strip other invisible characters.For an example, check out Amun's room, /d/events/dragonaug2008/rooms/ogre4. She made a typo in the room description, and instead of \"they've\" she has \"they^Rve\" (as visible by typing \"l\" on that line in ed)What should we do about that? Should we have strip_colors remove all invisible characters, or just include it in the mapper program, or what?"
