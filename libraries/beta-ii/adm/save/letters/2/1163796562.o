__Letter "No.It went down because of your rewrite of center.  I had to debug your new object in order for it to work right.  FYI, the simul_efun.c object is very sensitive.  Your rewrite of my center.c script called the even() function.  However, you didnt include the even() function until after including the center() function.  You must include in the correct order because technically until its included the function does not exist.  Same goes with the itos() function.  I removed it and added a +\"\" since thats all itos() technically does.As for the access it requires ssh so you will have to ask me to restart it.  There are very few that have access because of the sensitivity of the account.Whit"
