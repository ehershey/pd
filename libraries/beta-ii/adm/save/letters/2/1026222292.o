__Letter "Hey just saying My thoughts on Druss and some other stuffI didn't care for the fact that I didn't know Druss waseven put up for vote. Since I do play more then enoughsomeone could have mentioned it to me. If he already hada alt in our guild hey thats fine.... ex. like hey it's Ash i'm leet again after 2 hours let me in.I find it funny that I have seen him with a lot of Eq. that seems to be from illuminati. As a spy i'd say maybeyet I have seen him PK Aximili with a alt. but like thathasn't happened before.Also I did come across some information that I know his bro (Rakarth) is friends with Jekhar in RL just a little FYIYakko Warner"
