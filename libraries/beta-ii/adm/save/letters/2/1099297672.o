__Letter "Hi Stormbringer. I know this might sound really bad or annoying, but I wouldn't mind retiring Aziraphale and Zing for a few months to help with coding and general Immortal stuff.I am guessing you will have heard about the issue that happened between Venenum and Daos. It is something that can only be really discussed, not messaged or mailed, and should be done in depth, as it got really complicated.It would seem that the problem is that there is only one active coder for PD now, and it isn't enough with all the plans that were going through, especially from Venenum. I know Vene wouldn't mind coming back if he didn't have to work with Daos, as Daos has explicitly said he cannot work with Venenum.Just, I am pretty sure I am the longest standing player of PD. Yakko beats me, and maybe someone else, but other than that I am pretty sure I have been here longer than anyone else. I really like PD, and I think that it has a huge amount of potential. When Daboura and Venenum started working on abilities, and we got to see the effects of the changes, it was looking really good. I *really* got interested in playing again.I know Vene IRL and we've spoken about ideas for PD for hours, and we generally agree. There are so many ways to make this mud unique and exciting. Things like fighting styles, quest classes, race divisions, language barriers, weapon/armour expansion. Different continents for different races. Stringed abilities, stackable spells, cohesive spells, allies and enemies. A fully 3D sky and land, randomly generated wilderness that can stretch across an entire continent. We know how to code all of these things, and I would love to see these changes come to PD.Again, just, yeah. I don't want to see PD die due to a lack of incoming players, just because things are getting stagnant. I know people might not want to trust me, but I am pretty sure I have always been honest, I've admitted to my faults. I know that if I can get to be like the QA imm, like you had said I might get to be when I finished the new Elven village, I think I'll be able to do alot of good work.Umm, that's all.C'ya round."
