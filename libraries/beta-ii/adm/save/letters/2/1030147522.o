__Letter "I'm gonna sound like your mother, but I need to get this off my chest.Guild stuff you can and can not do1. You can add new members into the guild2. You can not promote or demote members3. If it sounds ify....don't do it :P4. Please leave the gold in the treasury, unless someone really really needs it.Other guild related topics:1. The contest of the room descripts will run till the friday after I come back.  I only got one mail from Greg.  Encourage the others to mud mail me thiers, and we'll have a guild vote on them.2. Find out the order of which we should buy our new rooms...I think we should have a oil and stone shop first.  If you can do this, maybe you can set up what the oils and stones (if picked first) should be.  The imms will then need the description of what it does when you (rub, drink, quaff, touch) it.  buy and oil and really pay attention to the messages when you use it, that should be your baseline ( Like I said if this is picked first)  If people want to know what direction in the guild it is going, say we are building upwards into the mountains.3.  Keep the treasury going, the more gold we get in there, the faster we can buy our guild addons.4. Just so you know, there are two open invites, then can join whenever they want.  Wisp and Kilmor.5. I think I hurt Greg's feelings by promoting you.  Remember he is only 13 years old, be nice to him.  When I come back, you and me will come up with some positions for councilor.  I have a few things in mind.  But this letter is alreay lengthy enough.If there is any questions, just ask me, at least before I leave :)"
