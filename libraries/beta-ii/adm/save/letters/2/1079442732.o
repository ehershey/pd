__Letter "Attention all, My name is Sasayaki Miyamoto. I am your locally designated dragon-and-mythological-beast remover for the Tirun area. I take the view that an ounce of prevention is better then a pound of cure, and this will be the focal point of my drive to remove all dragons from the land. The first step is, as with any pest species, to remove their food source: As I'm sure you're all aware, dragon's favorite food is barberqued wench, in particular, female virgins. They cannot, in fact, stomache anything else; therefore it is my selfless mission to remove all virgins from the land of Tirun in an effort to remove this scourge from our lands. Even if you're not a virgin, but female, you may report to me anyway, as one can never be too careful about these things.Yours faithfully, Sasayaki Miyamoto."
