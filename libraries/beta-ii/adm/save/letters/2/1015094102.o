__Letter "Ok here is the new and improved version. I re-sent all of it because the rooms have slightly changed descriptions to explain the location of things. I hope it works out allright this time.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Hall Description:You are standing in the Hall of Light, meeting place of the Illuminati. Along the length of the hall huge round white marble pillars support the weight of the tower. Oddly, black streaks swirl slowly around the pillars. The large stained glass windows on the surrounding walls unceasingly project their heavenly images perfectly upon the floor between the pillars despite the position of the sun. The floor is all polished white marble, and there is enough room to fit 100 people comfortably. At the far end of the hall you can see three thrones floating absolutely still in the air. The entrance to the guild's treasury is through a steel door in the southern wall. To the east lies the prayer room, and the guild's equipment store lies on the other side of a door to the southeast.It is quite a sight to behold.[look throne or thrones provides: The front throne is made of pure black marble and seems to absorb light from the air around it. Set out from the high back like a crown is a skull with a golden starburst impressed on it's forehead. The words \"M'Hael Artanis\" have been etched upon it The other two thrones sit to either side of the first, and slightly below. They are identical in almost every way, being made out of solid platinum inlaid with gold they have a small back and each has a golden halo floating above it. One has the words \"Asha'man Aziraphale\" inscribed upon it, the other says \"Asha'man Gabriel\".][> Exits: North, East, Southeast, South <]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Praying Room Description:This is the prayer room for the Tower of Light and it is here where the Illuminati come to pray to their gods. Plants of all descriptions surround the room and there are many beautiful flowers to look at. A large statue of a cleric with her hands cupped before her serves as a unique fountain as the water trickles between her fingers into a pool at her feet. The walls and roof are made of a clear glass that give the room the distinct impression of being outside. The only thing ruining the effect is the archway in the west wall leading back into the hall.<Pray or whatever to get your hp back>You smell the wonderful aroma of flowers.[look flowers will provide: The flowers are very beautiful and add to the peace of this place][look fountain will provide: The fountain is made of silver inlaid with gold and the water is crystal clear][> Exits: West <]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Treasury Room Description:The treasury for the Illuminati, this is where the guilds gold is stored. The room is bare white everywhere except for a small inscription on the opposite wall. A large steel door leads north into the hall.[look inscription provides: (How the treasury room works, I don't know so I can't tell you)][> Exits: West <]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Weapon/Armour Shop Description:The equipment store for the Illuminati, it is here where members may purchase special guild items such as weapons, armour, shields and other things that can be worn and wielded. All sorts of display items are hung all around the walls. The hall is out to the northwest.[look items will provide: All sorts of equipment hang on the walls, although they look good, they are worthless in battle][> Exits: Northwest <]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Entrance Room Description:Before you is a huge steel gate with spikes atop each of the vertical poles, it is the entrance to the Tower of Light and Hall of the Illuminati. As you approach you feel your skin tingle as you walk upon the hallowed ground. You notice that there is a bronze plaque with an inscription set upon the steel bars. The large double doors to teh Hall of Light stand just to the south of you.[look plaque will provide: A bronze plaque with an inscription, perhaps you hsould read it][read plaque will provide: The plaque reads:(new line)(Insert the poem thing from our help file here)](Guards go here)[> Exits: North, South<]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-                           [ ]                          / |                   [ ]-[ ] [C]                    |      -                   [1]                    |                   [2]-[3]                    | \\                   [4] [5]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1: Entrance2: Hall3: Prayer Room4: Treasury5: Equipment ShopC: Church, (i.e. Above paladin hall)If that's ok of course.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Ok, I hope that's better. I hope I actaully get to arrange the guild as a tower. If there is something else you need to tell me then don't hesitate to mudmail. I check every time I come on, and every once in a while besides. Anyway, back to exping for me, got another 70 Million to go. - Aziraphale, 'nuff said."
