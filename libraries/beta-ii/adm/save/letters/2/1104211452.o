__Letter "Your title says you need a guild. I am inviting you to become a Child of Asmodeus, in the ranks of Unholy. If you are interested, contact me when i am on, the only requirements are that you must be forever loyal to his Lordship Asmodeus, and whatever is said in the guild line or on the board is strictly for Unholy eyes only, there are players out there who would like to see what we have, but they cannot have alts in our guild, because they have broken our rules. Once again, contact me when im not or Tal if he is on. That is all."
