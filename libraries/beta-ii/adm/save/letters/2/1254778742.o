__Letter "Just a quick note:The damage done by different spells monsters use varies widely for monsters of the same level. Some spells are absolutely devastating while others are more in line with physical abilities.Shadow burst is a good example. Fireball in the new area from red giants does a bit over 300 to me. Shadowburst however does 650-700 to me from the black giants that are the same levels.Wizard spells are where this is most noticable. The demons is hell that use gore do about 400 damage to me. However the wizards spells do multiples of this. One of the spells (manablast i think) did 1.6k to me.Just wanted to point it out as it really changes the difficulty of monsters that give the same exp. Some are a bit dangerous while others are vicious murderers."
