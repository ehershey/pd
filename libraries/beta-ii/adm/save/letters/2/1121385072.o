__Letter "1)Jester move-firebreath Using a drink and/or torch basically spitting fire. Drink the drink while holding a torch, like the infinite one, and it unleashes a deadly blast of fire. 'You down your firebreather and spew forth a blast of fire!' etc etc can be based off  entertainment and attack maybe. Possibly just as a starting move with a delay. Drink...few rounds later it hits then you can continue normally.2)Bludgeon. Jester best weapon skill is blunt yet we have no moves for it and most settle for the lesser ranked dagger for cut(which blows). Now this could be based off blunt and attack or something to that measure and be a decent move past flick.'You bludgeon your opponent over the head while cackling like a madman!' \"Dregs bludgeons you over the head!\" Something like that.3) Oooorrr. Since all we have really useable is flick, how about at a later level we get an upgraded form of it? Multiflick. Work basically like flick(but based off a good jester skill like hm...entertainment?) except instead of flicking one coin you can flick up to like 3-6 coins at once. this would still be very jester like but really help out the higher level wanderers.4)as for other things remove fighters rogues and were good :DDregs Mcleod."
