__Letter "Ok, here is another idea we went over which I think should go along with the increased body dmg. Make it so raknids have at most a 50% chance of a 3 handed slash, and at most a 25% chance of a quad slash, this would help to balance the PvP issue, and in concert with the limb dmg, would I think balance them in terms of xping, and PvP."
