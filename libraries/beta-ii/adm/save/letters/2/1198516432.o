__Letter "Oil inheritable is /std/oil.c, which you can find by doing this:grep OIL /include/std/std.hThat searches for OIL in the std.h file.I scratched my head for a bit, then realized that the DW scalewas missing the ::create() line. Fixed now, but it's not the first onethat's been messed up, so if any other guild items don't seem to workthat's a good thing to check first."
