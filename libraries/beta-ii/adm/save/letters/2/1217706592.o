__Letter "ok that wasnt very clear. sorry guys.my question is this. how does the information returned for init_arg()get used?? Does it get stored along with the filename for the item oris it called when the object is reloaded??Basically all i need to pass is this;string *my_runes=({ \"rune_files_here\" });I'm gonna code it so that the weapons will then act according to whatrunes are in that array. I need it clarified how i can pass that arrayusing query_autoload() and init_arg() instead of save_object()."
