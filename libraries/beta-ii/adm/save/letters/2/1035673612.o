__Letter "Hey dunno if you still have ashram set as arrested or if he's gone for good, but if he's still around I was wondering if i could have him restored. Frankly i'm sick of people whinning angels are underpowered and since i'm not letting them know this is ash i'd like to have that char to post with and to do my arguing. Dunno if its possible but thanks either way-- Ruby."
