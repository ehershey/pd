__Letter "Hey I noticed the new gore changes. A couple thoughts:Yes gore was too strong before. But now it is a good bit too weak for an ability that is special to a quest race we had to get to lvl 50 just to get.My gore now does about 480 in the arena. To the same charechter my jab does about 430.A level 50 Gypsy (Rhuan) does around 600 to the same charechter with cut. Rhuan has significantly less skills and stats than Vyce.Chaoswave from Rivfader (lvl 37 skills and low stats) does 370 damage to me (215 magic defense at lvl 54). His room attack spell will be doing more damage than my single target quest race ability. Also mp is easier to regenerate than sp by far so he can attack more often than I can. The same holds true of Kataan's vortex as well, annihilate for many classes (Alchemon does over 600 with his to me). Rogues can do 2k with backstab at the same level with enough stats. Their circle does a good deal more than gore now does.The other demon ability massacre does 800 but takes 2 rounds. This works out to being slower than even jab.Please do something to make being a demon special. Let our gore be a bit stronger than non-quest race charechters. If my rush does 450 perhaps gore could be doing 600. Some insentive for quest race. Or if you wish to keep gore the same, then please look into changing massacre. As it currently stands fly is the only beneficial part of being a demon.Thank you,-- Vyce"
