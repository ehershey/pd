__Letter "You raped me of my innocence. You've taken everything and locked it away. Only you hold the key to what's left of me. You've poisoned my soul. And I let you take it all.I couldn't have stopped you. You were always stronger than me. I could've unleashed all hell on you and you still would've stopped me. But then again, I never wanted to stop you.I welcome you now, yearn for yo. You are the blook which courses within my veins. We speak the same words now, think the same thoughts.I am proud of you, as you are proud of me. We are each other's creationn. I formed you and then you formed me. You are my darkness as I am your light. Together, we are a masterpiece.I raped you of your darkness. I've taken everything and locked it away. Only i hold the key to what's left of you. I've cleansed your soul. And you let me take it all.(okay pretty sure i had plenty of typos in there since i'm using telnet, but oh well :p )Sort of a stream of consciousness piece, a bit..."
