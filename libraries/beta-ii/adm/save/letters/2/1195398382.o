__Letter "The senses system i've developed is going to be built right intothe Object.c file. In this way the information for senses willbe usable by ALL objects in the mud; rooms, monsters, users, armours, weapons, everything.We will have smell, listen, feel, taste, look, examine, read andsearch. These will be usable on EVERY LAST OBJECT in the mud. Asopposed to the old system where we only had smell and soundsinstalled on the rooms only. I really feel it's going to bringa whole new dimention to both designing and playing areas.If you wish to beta-test the system, Come talk to me. I'll setupa builder for you if you do not have one. When Stormbringer givesme the nod to open it for builders, you would be one of the firstto try it out.The details you will be able to create in your areas using thissystem will be incredable. It's operational now. I'm just waitingon the staff to review it.Only reason i posted about it ahead of time was to give people aheads up on what ive been dedicating my time too. I was intendingon using this in the Tirun Reef area :PIronman"
