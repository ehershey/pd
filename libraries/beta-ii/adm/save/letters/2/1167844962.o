__Letter "I'm slowly weeding out the functions from BuildSecure.c and handingthem over to my new system. The system will then be locked to everyonebut Whit, Stormbringer and myself. If you wish anyone else includedon there besides the 3 of us then mail me back with it.I noticed Daos was not on the BuildSecure.c file. I figured i wouldask you two if you want him on the new one or not.I seen from reading the master.c and BuildSecure.c that the access.dbwas pretty much not working. I'm therefore working on another way ofdoing that too :PIronman"
