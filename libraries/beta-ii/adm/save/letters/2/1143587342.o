__Letter "Is it worth using nomask on functions that shouldn't be overridden -- like the apply function on an oil or ointment -- or not? The reason I ask is because I'm working on changing ointment, and altering oils and stones, and want to make sure that some doesn't accidently (or \"accidently\") overwrite the important function that does the healing, but I'm not ure if it's really worth doing that with nomask. Your thoughts?Ugh, few typos, \"someone\", not \"some\", and \"but I'm not sure\".This would, of course, be in the inherited files (i.e., /std/oil.c)."
