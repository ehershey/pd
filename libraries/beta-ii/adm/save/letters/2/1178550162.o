__Letter "i don't know why you're pissed at me or why you kicked aeval out of the guild but you know thanks for letting me know... many told me that it was because aeval was married to warrick and you got pissed about it well you know it's not my fault you don't like him. then someone told me you pked rohl which i find funny. and i guess he is trying to rage war against you and the guild and since aeval is with warrick you think i'm going to tell him things that are going on sorry but i believe i told you i wouldn't do anything like that i haven't told samantha shit about forsaken and she's my best friend why would i go and tell them anything about forsaken this is a game and i wanted to aeval to be marriedwell what ever just don't take your anger and frustation out on me because i never done anything wrong nor have i broke the rules of forsakenplus i turn my net off so i could get caught up on my bills. and if samantha has said something that pissed you off then you know i'm done telling you over and over not to listen to her that she's going to tell you stuff to piss you off i don't know why she is like that but she isand as of late all i hear from her when ever i talk to her before i got my shit turn back on that you have been soo annoying and pissing off the whole mud and that you have had some additude as of latewell i haven't been here to see anything i really don't care that much but damn don't take things out on me when i haven't been on"
