__Letter "I just found a sister mudlib of nightmare, it is very similar so far from what I can see. Oh, and it runs on windows baby! So now I'm sitting around fucking with the lib. I think I might set up my router to allow outbound traffic to come in to it so perhaps you could screw aroundwith it at your leisure. Or just download it yourself. It's called Dark Souls."
