A blatent disregard for respect and maturity.I am backing you fully in any plan of action you wishto take interms of this abbuse and no doubt LIES, as to how in all bloody hell this item was aloud INTO the game.I pitty the fool who coded this item, and am SHOCKEDeven more towards who EVER approved this ITEM.My view of the player Kumi has only been even morerenfoeced by this disturbing matter.I will help in any way i can.Yours FaithfullyOrcha"
