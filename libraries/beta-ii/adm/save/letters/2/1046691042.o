__Letter "Ahahahah I have pissed you off soooooo many times. As Aziraphale I got 2 mails still here from you threatening me. One says if I overstep my bounds again I will lose imm and my welcome here. The other says I ahve until you are online again to explain myself.I can also remember the tell saying stop stacking protect or you would remove it and me from the game.And then there was the last thing on angel line.Anyway, here is why I left.PD just isn't fun for me. All the downgrades and changes aren't the main cause though. What it is is that Gabe, Drakule and I were going to become 100 all at the same time. Gabe started levelling without us while I was away for a week, and in the last few days, when drakule got his multi-hit breathe, he got to level96. Meanwhile I died. Now Drakule is already 100, and I am just going to hate missing out on getting that statue as the three of us.Also, angels and clerics have been getting their spells changed, true shield and protect were hackless, but did they have to be brought down so far? And having the cap on abilities has been getting annoying since I was not able to make mmy character any more pwoerful than it was.Also, Drakule got his breathe, yeah that is cool, but he also gets his idles with that, which doesn't seem right. Oh, and when you upgraded Dragons armour, Drakule takes no damage at all fighting 44k mobs, not 1 point of damage in 10 minutes of fighting. I take 30/round when I am wearing all the best eq on the mud, have max defense and got a maxed out shield cast on me...Savannah leaving, you wanted to know why. Do not worry about other players leaving for the same reason, it was mostly just a personal thing between her and myself. - Like in the movie \"Ocean's Eleven\"... - \"My wife already left me once, I don't think she'd do it again just for kicks.\"Note that it isn't any one thing that made me do it, it was the combination of all of it happening, and so much of it so close together.What were you going to talk to me about before you made me an imm?Hmmm, that's it for the moment. - Aziraphale, Prator, Azirel, Amakiira, JacerFlex."
