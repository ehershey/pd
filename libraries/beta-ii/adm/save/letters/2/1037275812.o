__Letter "Solars are the greatest of the celestials, usually close attendants to a deity or champions of some cosmically beneficient task (such as eliminating a particular type of wrongdoing).A 9-foot-tall humanoid with brilliant topaz eyes, silvery or golden skin, and gleaming white wings, a Solar has a deep and commanding voice.[Combat]Solar's are virtually unmatched in power. Other than demon princes, archdevils, and deities, nothing else in the multiverse approaches them. Even more fearsome than their *+5 vorpal dancing greatswords* are their +2 mighty composite longbows that create any sort of **slaying** arrow when drawn.[Spell-like abilities]At will - aid, animate objects, commune, continual flame, dimensional anchor, greater dispelling, holy smite, imprisonment, improved self invisibility, lesser restoration, remove curse, remove disease, remove fear, resist elements, summon monster VII, speak with dead.3/day - blade barrier, earthquake, heal, permenancy, resurrection, and shapechange.1/day - greater restoration, mass charm, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, prismatic spray, any symbol spell, wish.All these spells are as though cast by a level20 sorceror.Additionally, these spells are ALWAYS acitve on the Solar's person. They can be dispelled, but reactivating them is a free action.- detect evil, detect snares/pits, discern lies, see invisibility, true seeing.In addition to the above spells, Solar's can cast cleric spells from the Air, Destruction, Good, Law and War domains as though they were level20 clerics.[Celestial qualities]As a free action the Solar can surround itself with a nimbus of light having a radius of 20 feet. It acts as a double strength \"magic circle against evil\" and as a \"minor globe of invulnerability\" - Both as cast by a level22 sorceror.Solar's can speak with any creature that has a language.Solar's are immune to electricity, cold, acid and petrification attacks. They resist the first 20 points of fire damage each round, and have a +4 bonus to resist poison.Solar's also resist the first 35 points of damage from each attack (unless made by a +4 or greater weapon)Solar's regenerate 15 hp every round.[The Stats]HP:	22d8+110Speed:	50ft ground /150ft air (good) - They have as much control over their flight as would a house fly.Str:	28Dex	20Con	20Int	23Wis	25Cha	25*Oh yeah. Vorpal means it decapitates on a critical hit. Dancing means the sword can fight on it's own.***Slaying arrows can kill instantly the type of creature they target, this bow MAKES them as you draw**"
