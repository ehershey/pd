__Letter "Hey Simi, I hope you've had a good day so far, I think you can say mines gone pretty weel. I've missed you a lot today and can't wait to talk to you. Happy Vanlentine's Day Beautiful. Oh, and for something to do I'm going to make a monk, so whenever you get online look at the monks online and I'm bound to be one of them. I love you and Happy Valentine's day.Forever and Always yours,Joshie :)"
