__Letter "Hello, I'm a leader of a guild called Dragon Warriors.  Since we are a fairly new guild, as of right now, there isn't any quests, or stupid questions to answer to join the DW.The guild is based around the members, everything gets voted on, right down to the last gold coin that is spent.  I want to create a fun guild, and to do that, I would like to see every class and subclass be represented.  All that is required of you that you read the guild board and participate in the discussions on the board.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.Thank you for your time.Hepualaha'ole"
