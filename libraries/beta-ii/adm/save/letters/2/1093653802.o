__Letter "Ok, here are some ideas I've been mulling over with some people. How about this. Making it so raknids get dealt a larger amount of body damage to there arms, a lot more, so they would have to stop every so often and mend thier limbs, or risk them falling off mid combat. Second they should also be only allowed to have a 25% chance of doing a quad slash, max, and a 50% chance of doing a 3 armed slash. I think these two downgrades in concert would slow their insane xping to more manageble levels, and the percent chance would level the playing field in PvP."
