__Letter "I have mailed you some updates on builders. I also included you inthe mails that i sent to Daos and cortoth. Im trying to streamlinethe reviewing process for us. Tell me if you like the system I came up with and mail me back a revised version if you want itchanged. The readers digest version is a follows;    1) I review for functionality. Make sure the code works.    2) Cortoth reviews for story and grammer. Want to make the       areas have some meat on their bones.    3) Daos does a general review as he normally does. Picking       it over with a fine tooth comb.    4) Nulvect is called in to do a balance review. This is to       make sure that the area is properly gauged for the group       of mortals that the builder intends to play there.    5) Finally, after the builder repairs any and all issues and       the area is re-reviewed, It will come to you and Luna       for integration into the main port.Step #1 is mainly for places where there are quests and/or custombuilt objects. I want to make sure the code will work and not barfon us.Please mail any revisions back to me you want integrated into thisprocess. I want to make the process more streamline so it's nottaking months for areas to come in. I think this will do it.If/when you give your stamp of approval, well start using thissystem for reviews and make it public to the builders on thecontruction board.Ironman"
