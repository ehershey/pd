__Letter "K. Well, I want two lockable rooms. I already mailed you the first rooms description here's the other one\"All around you, you see leopard skin. On the west wall there is a huge canopy bed with a fluffy leopard skin comforter and many large pillows to match it. The carpet is pure leopard skin. The walls are a light black color that match the whole room. There is a balcony coming off of a large bay window acroos from the bed. Near the window is a large chestnut colored wardrobe. The room smells fresh of strawberrys and cream.This room will be up from the first room.Well, mail me back with everything else you'll need.Luv ya, Mocha."
