__Letter "It was noon and the moon started to elcipse the sun. Poeple walkingaround staring into the sky. Several scavenger birds start to circle overhead. In an ally to the back a rogue starts to secretly tunnel out the beginnings of his hideout. He wonders if anyone has seen him. No-one he hopes. This is the first member of theDark Souls.On this day, a second member was added. Hearing voices in his head, doing things ofevil to silence them, he falls in love with a beautiful woman, whom eventuallyleads him to find the darkest side of the soul. His body burns and twists as hisonce half-elf form is destroyed and replaced with that of a demon. He noticestwo smaller demons sitting on his shoulders whispering into his ears. These arehis voices, these are the things that drove him to insanity. He senses the first member,alone in his hideout, and phases through the walls to find him. After a long battle between the two people, the first member overcomes the intruder and offers him a place in the guild. This is the second member of the guild.The inhabitants of Tirun, feeling no harm as the eclipse passed, do not know ofthe secret organization that has festered and made a home. Like a cancer growinginside of a city. The beings of the Dark Souls now poison the realm. Take heed andbeware for though they had shadow dwellers, their magi are much to be feared.hows this?"
