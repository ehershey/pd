__Letter " Two Haunted Houses                            |    All    |   2 i see that when i type inventory amulet. it's from the big quest mob in rhon, kra'toan village area.and you said you gotta rework purg. that building in the graveyard, is that a dead end right now or is there SOME way in? if it's a dead end i won't waste any more time on it.. that'd be a cool quick area to codeanyway, yeah.. you should make THAT amulet wearable by dragons, it's a quest type no drop item. makes sense. and PLEASE let me know one way or the other about purg, not asking for info, just it's existance.the albino rhino"
