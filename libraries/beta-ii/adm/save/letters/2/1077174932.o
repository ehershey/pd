__Letter "Sorry if this email bugs ya a little bit... but I tried emailing you and I never got a response...  This was the only place I could think atall to try to contact you.  ( I also am currently using telnet... so any spelling or grammatical errors are not intentional...  Anyway, please please try to get ahold of me if you can.  I need to figure out what I am doing for the summer soon.... so I can either arrange a flight to Hawaii or Illinois, or try to apply for scholarships or internships as soon as possible...  Time for me is quickly drying up. :P  Anyway, I just wanted to know if you had decided on anything as far as this summer goes.  I don't wish to rush you into anything...  I just really need to know soon.  :S  Sorry to pressure you into a decision.  Anyway, please email me or...  something if you can.  Whether the answer is good or bad I need to know.  lol  Not that you saying no would be bad. :P  I just need to know....  I have probably said this new about 20 times....Ah well... thanks and I hope this didn't bug ya. :P  Laters, Eric"
