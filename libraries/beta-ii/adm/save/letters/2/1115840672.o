__Letter "Not sure how you're feeling, dont think that I think this game is more important than your health.But I just wanted for you to maybe give something some thoughtNot sure if you're aware but I pretty much quit pd, I stay on to idle sometimes, talk here and there for a minute but I am not what anyone would call active.The reason for this was because I remorted when I shouldnt have, so was just curious if there is any chance you'd do the undoable and revert me back.. I think it would really make me start playin againbut I understand it's probably not going to happen, I just figured with the way the mud has been lately it was worth a shot asking..and if you're not able to actually recover my old self from the games memory I would tell you exactly what lvl/skilltotal/stattotal I was.. it's the strongest i've ever gotten anyone, I remember exactly what he had :Pthanks, Dubs"
