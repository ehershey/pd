__Letter "hey, i did all the room updates for the rooms with the mobs. Daos checked the first couple rooms, said i did it right, so i did all the rooms. it is all done, and i assume back on track? i DID test my armour and weapons, and they all worked for me. and i have fought my mobs so i know they all work fine. sorry about the whole mob room mix up, i didnt know about it, BUT now i do...so I know for next time. nonetheless, it is done now."
