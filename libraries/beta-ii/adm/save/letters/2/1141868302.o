__Letter "After reading your post concerning the custom waxes, im interested in procuring them to be put into Unholy's shop.Although, for right now, im just curious as to what the pricing on them is.  The actual design for them hasn't been looked into yet, but it will sometime soon. Also, im guessing the custom part is just the name used for the wax?  And lastly...Do they stack on top of the current waxes in inventory(regular ones) when it comes to owning too many waxes?Thanks for yer time with my blitherin ^_^"
