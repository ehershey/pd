__Letter "If you all have noticed sluggish connectivity to and from the server it seems my wonderful ISP has been having hardware problems and has been reporting to the general community that everything was ‘fine’. However, after I caught them in a lie today and them not willing to credit our bill for the downtime/slow speeds, I am considering dropping their service and getting business-class DSL connectivity (increased to 3mb down / 1mb up) from BellSouth as I can get it cheaper since I have a business phone/account from my home office already. As a bonus plus, the new service will also come with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) so I will get credited for any connectivity issues. The reason I am contacting everyone is that if I do go ahead w/ the business DSL service, the IP address will most likely change… however, if you are currently using your subdomain name (or just www.murpe.com) to connect, all you will need to do is wait for the DNS to update w/ the new IP address and connectivity should continue just like before. I just wanted to keep you all in the loop and will give you the heads-up when the change will take place. -- Michael"
