__Letter ":( I did not want you to leave Paul, and I ask that you think it over again.  The thing is, whe you asked Illisse about me and Stacey...you did get a biased opinoin...b/c she hates the both of us.  I did not want you to leave the guild, I just wanted you to realize that She is a fuckin Liar and hates my guts so she would do anything to bad mouth me.  I am so sorry you felt you had to go behind our backs..but you didnt have to, i would have told you upfront.  And I did not expect you to just leave and never speak to me again, b/c you are I are friends, outside of PD..  I wish you would come back, and you always can...you are always welcome.Much love,Carinaoh bah....Samantha S. Smith"
