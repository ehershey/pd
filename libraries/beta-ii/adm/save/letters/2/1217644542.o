__Letter "I know I'm not the farthest in my area, but I've been jumping around from thing to thing in it.  Slowly but surely, it will get done, there's just one thing I'd like to put into it that Ironman said I'd need to talk to you about.I'd like to add a subclass to the Wanderer class.  A quest subclass, the Illuminist.  It would be a sort of cunning and trickery based person, but also very intelligent.  As a quest subclass, it would end up using all stats and get both abilities and spells, but not be too much stronger than other classes.  I plan to make the quest to be very hard, and I want it to be very rare.More on the subclass itself, the Illuminists are brethren of the Illuminati.  They are regular people who have, through ancient secrets and treasures, learned to be extraordinary.  They are the cunning protectors of their secrets.  That's a kinda help file definition :P  I haven't fully figured out exactly how I want them to go, but I kind of like the idea that they take items throughout the game back to their hall to help them learn their new abilities and shape their path.  Say I put an ability onto the ID for a paladin's sword from Lodos, they examine markings in the hilt of the sword, unwrap it, and see glyphs that explain the healing powers of the paladin.  If their glyphs skill is high enough to read it, they can learn to heal.  I know there's a lot of things like dragon and vamp and lich being added in, but I really like the idea of a new subclass, and would be willing to work with Ironman to code all of it at no toll to your current projects.  He said that if we get the OK, he'd be able to help me with it :)Thanks for reading this really long mail."
