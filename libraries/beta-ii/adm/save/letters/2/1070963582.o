__Letter "here's a copy of the mailWell, you'll have to forgive me a chuckle.  I expected that you both would like your positions back in a month or so.  I know because I've been in the same position myself.  That's when I just take breaks from PD for a while, sometimes a month at a time.  Anyway...  I'm glad you want to come back.  But there's something I want to make sure you know.  The problems that caused you to leave are still here.  Chances are they'll always be here.  There will be imms/admins that do nothing, players will whine about the hard work you do, and the like.  If you're sure you'd like to do some imm work again, send me a mudmail and we can discuss individually what your job will be and stuff.(sent to you and azira, copies sent to all other admins)                   -NS"
