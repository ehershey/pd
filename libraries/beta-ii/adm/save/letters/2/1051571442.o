__Letter "I'm selling my guild. I don't really get on that much anymore, and I don't feel like messing with it anymore. I am the only active member. And I would be willing to sell it to you for your price if you want it. It's got a stone/oil thingy, extra room thing that was there when it was given to me, bar, and barracks. I was thinking you could use it as an extra guild hall or something. If you want it just mudmail me back. Also, there are a few members in it, but if you buy it you can do what you want with them.Mocha."
