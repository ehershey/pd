__Letter "Hey. Lots of people complain that I exp in low hm areas. Lemme explain my reasoning and give a few possible solutions that might be done.I can kill a 26k (17k for me) in 1 one round. In rhondale i take 2-3 rounds to kill 35-41k (25-28k for me). The exp per round is way less in those areas. The same is true of areas like drow (6 rounds to kill 100k instead of 17k per round).Also add in the fact that killing 25k and 26k monsters I don't have to use oils as much. Oil slows exping down in higher level areas which further slows exp rate.The fastest exp is at lvl 36 before exp cuts come in to play on 25k currently. I never exped faster than I did then. Exp cuts on 25k and such are a very good idea and I completely agree with them. However the issue is the HP and Defense of the higher level monsters. These make them take exponentially more time to kill than low level monsters. This high hp and defense is not balanced out with a significant enough ammount of exp to make these monsters be worth fighting.My recommendation is to increase the exp of monsters over 45k (this is around when they take noticeably longer to kill). This would be similar to what is done in drows but to a larger extent. Again the issue is not the damage the monsters do, but rather the ammount of time they take to kill because of defense/HP.BTW this is my 17th elite charechter and for all the ones I have had, I have exped much much faster killing in merk/tene/lodos/sewers than anywhere else.Exp cut levels could also be raised for areas such as roston, rhondale, shadow caverns, ect so that players can still level and exp in other areas besides low level places at a decent rate. At level 50 my fastest exp spots were lodos/merk/sewers/etc. Now I would exp faster in roston and rhondale if not for the cuts. However with cuts I am better off staying with low level monsters.This has gotten long and rambly. To sum up, look into making an incentive for killing larger monsters, otherwise there will be less insentive to ever advance past 36 which is about the best place you can exp at until you have 200+ in stats.Thanks,-- Vyce"
