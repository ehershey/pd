__Letter "Well after my second death from strdyer for no reason, I think I am going to just have to stop playing. Obviously I can't enjoy myself while people, well ashram, keeps having this big powertrip over killing me. Perhaps if I learn to code more I could get to be an admin or something and help you out. Anyway, I'll just rack up idle time in the [] but I won't be exp'n because it is useless. I'll just do some stuff on builder's maybe, I dunno.	- Aziraphale"
