__Letter "You may not know it, but I've been unbanned for quite a while.  Nearly a year now.  Basically, since the admins got Primal Darkness back up.  You may not have known *who* I was playing as, but I had been playing.  I have played civilly, and, at times, uncivilly, I'll admit, but no less civil than some other players here, who I will not name, as I'm trying to keep this respectful.I've been unbanned, and I've been less and less like Cenn every day.  I don't know how many of you realized it, quite a few have mentioned it to me.  However, after a few things happened, and some players triggered off events, which led to a lot of hatred.Most of the people who re-started this trend, don't even feel that way anymore, or continue to do it.  Yet, a few players do feel the need to, and feel that I'm still who I used to be, those years ago.  May I add, those years ago, when I was quite young.  I started mudding when I was 9 years old, and started Primal Darkness when I was late 9, nearly 10.  Most of my \"Cennish\" activity was 11-13.  I may only be 15 now, but I'm a hell of a lot more mature than when I was 11 years old.Yet, some of you can't accept that, and feel the need to continue punishing me for my past, now, even when I don't act like the person you want to punish.  Even though I was no longer the person you want to punish.You kept Cenn with you, and pushed him back in to me.  I tried to get rid of Him, but you wouldn't let me.  You treated me like him, even when I was trying to not be, and you made me him again.  You put him back in to me, you brought him back.I love Primal Darkness.  It's a great place, with quite a few great people.  Although recently, it feels like the mud is degressing, I'm sure everything that is happening to it is for a reason, and when the Big Update comes, it will be well worth it for you.However, I quite like not being Cenn, and having you push me back towards him isn't acceptable, so I guess, what this post was trying to do, is be my formal resignation as a player of Primal Darkness.  Thank you for the good times, and the bad times which made me a stronger person, mentally and emotionally.Peace!"
