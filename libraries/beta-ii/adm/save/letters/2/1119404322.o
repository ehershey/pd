__Letter "Listen, you really need to talk to Carina about Furiae.  I'm losing my patience with her going off on me all the time cause of her stupidity.  I had to gate to tirun today cause of a problem in FF.  Furiae entered my portal again and proceeded to tell me as well as Carina.  I tried to explain but I don't scry to see if furiae is in the square nor do I deserve so much grief either."
