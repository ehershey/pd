__Letter "stormy, when you read this, please arrest my character until January 1. If you so please. This place is not doing me any good. With David changing orcha's race, class and subclass and then leaving (i changed him back, btw. what david did was wrong), and with daos being able to do nothing about a spam character/person who just kept making new characters to come on and annoy me, Daos and everyone else (who then took it personally at me on AIM[the character used to be posenda btw, an old char]) when he should have at least been able to block their IP. With you and whit always idle, and no one around the properly police the mud when we imms need it the most, i'm sorry, but i have other things to do then come on to try and calm everyone down, and then be confronted with players who don't care because they have inside info/dealings/alliances with staff (Aziraphale), people who spamm and attack me (IPs 203.103.56.103 and 69.136.42.164, incase you can't find it later and daos doesn't take it down) and then i cry.maybe that doesn't make me staff/immortal material, but it does make me human.sorry for the drama stormy. but you'll prolly get more of it from players.Carmen.PS: carsqn@gmail.com"
