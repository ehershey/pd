__Letter "Hi Nightshade,Here is what happened.  I tried to log to pd july 11 during the evening, and got one of those !error! please report thisbug to admin messages.  Then when i tried to type commands in like inventory or look it just gave the next line as blank.So i logged on a couple more times, then i was able to get on and used my commands.  Then i noticed that all myinventory was gone except for 8 diamonds (i originally had 27), a few seals and some marked ones.Let me know if you can figure this one out :)Thank youNoa"
