__Letter "Pavitra House  (Sacred House)>-I am going to expect a lot of things coming from this house.  You guys will be the brains behind the  operation.  I am hoping that people will take an interest of coding.  It doesn't have to be massive  areas, it can be fun little mini quests, or fun little things to do.  For example, the pony express  idea that stormy put in.-The members in this house will have something, I just can't decide what they should have, but it might  be a necklace, or a ring, or something of that fashion.  Maybe have them vote on it?-I am pretty flexible on how you decide to run your house.  If you want to have ranks, or roles, etc.   Go for it.  If you decide that you want some sort of comittment test before they join the house, it's  totally up to you.  If you have any doubts to your decisions, just let Buddah or me know how we can  back you up.-I will not tolerate anyone in the Pavitra house taking any p.k. action on thier own.  As you stated in  your post earlier, this house will use other methods to handle the situations.  If anyone is having a  stalker problem, make sure they post on the Rakshane House Board, and the problem will be dealt with.   But with one exception to this rule, the protectors aren't encourage to go on a p.k. spree.-I have encourage Daboura to do this with his house, and now I'm going to encourage you to sugguest to  your members to post on the Rakshane Board if they have anything to contribute to the house.  It will  keep the sense of unitiy within the guild.  I don't want the houses to act as seperate guilds within  the guild.  We are all in this together.-If there is anything that you guys can think of to improve your house, extra rooms, eq, etc.  Please by  all means, let me know.  Just remember that all ideas to improve the guild costs money so it might take  time to fulfil a request, but it will eventually get in.>-Well I guess this outlines the guild a little bit more.  I'm hoping with in time, it will get defined to a more finer point.  Have fun with your new role, and don't hesitate to ask me or Buddah any questions."
