__Letter "Hi again. Just one other thing i noticed about balance that I wanted to mention real quick.All abilities do roughly the same damage for a fighter. whirl/slash (2 armed)/rush/headbutt/jab.  For me each of these abilities did 200 damage in arena vs the same player. They all take about 100 sp except slash which takes 50.However for a raknid their slash would do double the damage of any of my abilities for the same sp as mine. This lets raknids do double damage for the same ammount of sp. There is no draw back to raknidsThe damage of a raknid slash is equal to the damage of my charge (centaur) plus it has no delay and they get their normal attacks in addition to the ability.All of this adds up to making raknids very out of balance. The best solution I can see to this is to greatly increase slash's SP cost (would still make zerkers too strong) or to buff up some other abilities. For example whirl could do 300 vs a raknid slash that does 400. Also centaur's lost their rush bonus. This essentially does away with any reason to be centaur as their inferior armor and huge charging cost (1 mil per point for me) is not offset by any advantages (charge is not useful for exping as it does less damage than a rush + normal round)Thanks again for all you do for the mud-- Vyce"
