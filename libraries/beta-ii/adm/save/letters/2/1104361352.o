__Letter "Hi, Trev's taking the laptop until after my dinner, so I can't use it untilthen, I'm kind of at his mercy regarding usage, because it would be the only access I get right now.It's 10 am right now, so figure 8 hours from now? I guess it's 4 pm yourtime? Also, tell Leana you're mine. :)*hugs*Ray"
