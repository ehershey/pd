__Letter "I stayed up with Daos until 2:40 AM, and I finally got through his quality check on my area to make sure all those cool things are up to par.  If you would be able to go through it sometime and let me know what you would like me to change that would be excellent.  Sorry if this message doesn't make sense, I need sleep :P Love,Cenn"
