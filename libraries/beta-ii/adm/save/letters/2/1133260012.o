__Letter "You are so very cool.You guys were making such a great MUD. It was always so much fun to play here, it was just so sad that it all ended so badly.I'm sure if things changed a bit more often here alot of people would get excited about it! people would try out new and different things.I reckon if you opened thingsup a bit to addition and expansion, let player made things come in more often, people would like it more.remember you said you'd give me access to implement things to the MUD if my newelven village got put in? and it did but you never promoted me? Come on we coulda made this place awesome.not liek things are *bad* at the moment, they aren't, they're just kinda.... normal/boring/same/unchanging/stagnant. There isn't anything new, fresh and exciting.I like coding alot, but I stopped doing it because I never got to see people really play with the things I made.How often are new realms able to be put in here? If I made stuff would it get in if it was balanced (I don't play so I'm sure it would be)I hear you are on more often now? What's going on? Everything cool?"
