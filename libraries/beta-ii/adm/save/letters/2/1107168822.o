__Letter "I have a question. If someone pk's me then pk's someone else in my guild. Is the guild still bound by the 5 day rule. I mean if I pk them for pking me and the other guild member pk's them for pk'ing them can they claim harrassment? I would like to know. Here is the situation. Genocide pk'ed me then pk'ed Tia. If I pk Genocide, does that mean Tia cannot pk him for 5 days?  Thanks"
