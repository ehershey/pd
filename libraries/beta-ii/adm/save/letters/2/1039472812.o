__Letter "Wow, you were amazing last night. I'm glad we finally got to spend some time together. It looks like the next week (this current weke actually) is going to be pretty busy for me, being the week before mid-term exams. So I'll probably be on every once in a while, but I can't really give you a set time. So I guess I'll see you when I see you, sexy. Tel next time *wink*,Savannah."
