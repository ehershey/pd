__Letter "Where the fudge you been, boy?  I haven't seen you forever.  Did Kabaal beat your ass or something? Nah, couldn't be.  You could smack that stoner like he was your bitch.Oh another note, I haven't had much time to play the mud, but in the time I have had I've learned that the whole thing about maxing blade to wield starscreams will never work.  With blade at 30, it takes me 5 million to raise it by 3.  How fucked up is that? It's just not worth it.  I can invest my XP in much more satisfying ways... I've already bumped my strength up to 40 and working on bumping dex to 45.  Soon, my stats will start to get good.On another note, Hermes is married. Yay! Some chick from Merentha.  She's nice, smart, and apparently has this thing about riddles and is able to stump me with regularity.  Only problem is originally I thought, for some strange reason, that she was 18.  Turns out she's 16... Bleh.  Oh well, not like I'm going to sleep with her or anything like that, eh?  Anyway, she doesn't act 16 so things should be cool.  She plans to be the first level 50 gypsy.  More power to her, I guess.  On another note, Halo remorted.  He's become an assassin... Apparently Stormbringer is allowing Angel rogues.  I find it kind of stupid, myself as that robs him of the two spells he gets as an angel.  Without faith you do not have Holyfire, without Magic Attack you don't have Levin (Although levin is still useless no matter what your MA is).  I think Aldur is going to give up being the first demon berserker.  It's just not worth it for him.  Think about it, paco.  You can't use demon abils in your rage and you don't have magic defense. So you are relying pretty much on wisdom.  And since Angels get free pk on demons we are seeing Aldur get raped a bunch of times by holyfire since he can't defend against it.Also, I think I solved the Dragon quest but, obviously, I can't and won't tell you anything about it. But I'm going to try and figure it out...In any case, I'll catch ya."
