__Letter "my remark wasn't really meant to be in a smart ass way, if it seemed that way, I'm sorry. I'd gladly sit down and talk to you about it, because i have one concern, ive always had one concern with the way dab does things. Next time you're on, and I am as well, send me a tell and we can chat."
