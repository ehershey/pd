__Letter "Honey, I won't be on until late.  I'm meeting Rick and the rest of the crew for a game of D&D.  This is the last time I play at the last minute.  I plan on being home around ten or eleven your time but just in case I love you and I will miss you.  Please take care of Seraph as in keeping her company if she comes on while I'm not here.  She's a really good friend.Have a good evening.  I love you."
