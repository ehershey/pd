__Letter "I have been giving that a lot of thought, If I were to build an area, I'd want it to be something like a mountain. If viewed from the top, you'd see all these different levels with possibly different weather patterns. Near the top might be snow, further down like a forest, etc. I'm also up for mazes, etc. Those are fun to figure out how to navigate, I think. Thanks for listening.Uza"
