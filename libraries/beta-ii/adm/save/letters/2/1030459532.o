__Letter "Okay, it's all up to you to keep this guild running smoothly.  I'll be back september 10.  Greg's idea for a ring is cool, but imms voted that down for other guilds, and we would need a shop to be able to get one.  If you run into any problems at all, tell faust the problem, I'll be in daily contact with him.  Just watch out, you are on his hit list.....but you didn't hear that from me :)  something about mouthing off to him or something...I could care less what he does.  Please keep a special eye out on daboura, I still say he is leviathas.  I have levi on my aim, so every time he logs on, I know he's on, he's not very bright.  You'll be able to tell when he starts posting, if he starts posting.  I haven't heard anything from him, not even a hi.Anyhoo, have fun"
