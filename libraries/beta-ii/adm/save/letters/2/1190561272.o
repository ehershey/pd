__Letter "I would like to talk to one of you about my services here.I wish to keep my main focus on the builders port and basicallyfilling the void that was created when nesoo left. I will helpthe builders get their projects functional and Daos will do thereviews. If this is acceptable to the administration, it is howi will proceed. I've already written a slew of tutorials forcoding in LPC. You can locate them in /doc/coding on the buildersport. I'm in the process of doing the files for sfuns now.I would like to hold a token immortal post here on the main port.I wouldnt mind helping with any special projects that you wouldask of me but i want to keep my focus on helping the builders tomaster LPC. Perhaps the LAW immortal post since no one iscurrently in that position ?? Only thing i would need for that isaccess for the logs and the right to make commands log so i cantrace player activities better. Kinda the way i have for builderson the other port.I will give details if/when i wanna change something. I wouldn'tgo hog wild like i did on the builders port :P I did it therecause of all the complaints i had read/hear about past buildersand i created my system to correct/nulify the problems that wereon the immortal board. It's just that my system allows for alotmore flexability then the BuildSecure.c system did.Ironman"
