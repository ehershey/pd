__Letter "You use it in one of two ways:set_sense(\"smell\", \"rose\", \"It smells flowery.\");orset_sense(\"smell\", ({ \"rose\", \"tulip\" }), \"It smells flowery.\");You can use a function pointer instead of the last string of course,and the function it points to needs to return the string that you'll see."
