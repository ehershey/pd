__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Venenum to Orcha Fri Jul 23 13:24:44 2004:-----A whole list of dragon spells and abilities are completed just waiting to be added. My hands are tied. I cannot put them in if I wanted to. They are \"pending review\" and have been for several months. Dragons are my favorite race and we are working, slowly, on them- but the work we imms do must pass by the admins first. You may or may not realise this, but I am the only staff member that can code who gives two flying fucks about Dragons- the others don't care. Dragons are right down the bottom... down under the mud crashing, preventing more dos attacks, etc. Your blind hatred for the hand that feeds you is ludicrous. Hephulahole, Azire and I are trying to make dragons better- *you* are one of the main reasons we want to quit. Change will come- slowly, but change will come."
