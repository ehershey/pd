__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Carina to Nesoo Mon Jan 16 23:12:34 2006:-----I can understand why my item would be taken away if I were abusing the item.  I however, shoot off a firework once a week? if even.  If yall truly think I should not be allowed to have it, talk to Daboura as he was the one that OKed it in the first place, allowing me to have fireworks.  ALSO, when it was made, Dabby said no special things should be allowed to be in combat, and both illisse and bellos's pets can be in combat.  If it is a possibility, idc if i have the fireworks, i just want my phoenix back, even if he cant do anything put sit there and look pretty."
