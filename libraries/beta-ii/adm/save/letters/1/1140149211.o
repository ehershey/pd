__Letter "Hi, I was talking to a few people and they said that you couldn't come onbecause you couldn't leave the square because of Vyce. If you think youwon't be on very often, you could divorce me. They also said you can'teven come on your alts. I don't know if this is true, but if you want,divorce me.hugsKayley"
