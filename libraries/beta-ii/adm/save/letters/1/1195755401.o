__Letter "aThis mailing is to explain where the parts of the system arestored and how they're differing from the original system.================================================================Removed from original system for /std/IRON_OBJ_CHAIN================================================================The /std/room/senses.c is NOT inherited by the room.c containedin my mock object chain. Those senses are obsolite under mysystem. It will be very simple to modify the describe_current_roomcontained in user.c when the time comes to mimic the affects ofthe old system.The cmd_read() has been removed from the object.c in my obj_chain.It to is obsolete under my system. My reading system is vastlysuperior to this old system and removes the need to do add_action()when you want the player to be able to read things.===============================================================Added to the new system for /std/IRON_OBJ_CHAIN===============================================================1) /std/obj/iron_sense.c     This file contains the functions that store the sesory data     for the objects. It is inherited by the object.c contained     in /std/IRON_OBJ_CHAIN. The rest of the object chain then     inherits the mock object.c and gain these functions in turn.     This includes the room.c so it can store sensory data as well.2) /cmds/iron_senses      This directory contains the actual commands for the sensory      system. They interpert the data stored by iron_sense.c on      the objects. You can get the syntaxs by calling the commands'      help functions. The syntaxes are not in stone. We can      determine the final syntaxes later if we want.3) /wizards/cortoth/iron_senses      This directory contains some sample objects that make use      of my sensory system. Stand in the sample room so that you      are not catching interferance from the old system.====================================================================      INSTRUCTIONS====================================================================1) cd /wizards/cortoth/iron_senses2) goto experimental_room.c3) call me;add_search_path;\"/cmds/iron_senses\"3) call \"/cmds/iron_senses/ <file>\";help       for each cmds' syntax5) use the senses upon the sample objects.====================================================================================================================================You will see that the details we can install on our objects usingmy system are very through. We can set up just about any sensorydetail we wish on them.One MAIN issue i want you to pay close attention to is the factthat the system has the ability to use strings OR functionpointers. The system's commands will automatically execute thefunction call. It is used as an example in the mist_guard.c file.Its the reason i asked you to review it. I know you understandusing the (: :) calls too.Ironman"
