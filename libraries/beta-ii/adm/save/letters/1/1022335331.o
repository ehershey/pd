__Letter "It's not the fact, that some races have cheaper stat costs that really upsets me, it's the fact that i really don't know and people aren't willing to help me gain the informationIt's not only you, I've had a run in with Rathe about it too.I know Dragons are still being sorted out, and if people would just discuss the issue with me, instead of telling me they won't as to not upset me I wouldn't get so upsetAt least i can go to the Admins and say hey this compare to this, doesn't seem right to me, or i think whatever is too cheap, or too expensive.All i want is a balance, i've stopped improving intelligence at 30 because if i improve it i end up with more mp then hp.And yes i feel dragons should have cheaper con and str, not dex, i mean it's not easy to swing a semitrailer around a hairpin bendDragons are suppose to be intelligent, but i doubt they would be more intelligent then an elfThe way i see it, Con and Str should be our cheapest, then dex and wisdom, char then intelAt the moment they are all the sameAnne"
