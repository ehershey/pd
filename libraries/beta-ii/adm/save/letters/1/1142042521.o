__Letter "Actually, I think inherited files become part of the file that inherits them, so no real memory savings there... If that's your goal, using it as a stand alone file that you call functions out of (like the TRIVIA thing we set up for Quessalaz) is a better idea.In either case, though, I wouldn't worry about it too much. I'm pretty sure we have tons and tons of memory to spare :)"
