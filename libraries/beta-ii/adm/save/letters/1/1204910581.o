__Letter "Hi, I'm on as Nenet, but mail Rayna back.  I was thinking.  Yes, I know I should forgive/forget and turn the othercheek.  I've done it so many times with guys who hurt me big time.  I was only going to send J an email, not to be nasty or hurtful, but tojust relay what happened.  But, I really don't think I should waste my timeor energy on someone who doesn't care about me or never really loved me.If he had loved me like he said he did, he would have waited for me to getthrough what he did.  I don't want to waste that time on him when I have someone who is morecaring and loving.  I only wanted answers to questions that he didn't answer, but I guess it willnever happen, so I'll close that chapter in my life.Miss you, hope you are having a nice time.Hugs, to the man who has changed my view on things.love,Raynaxoxo"
