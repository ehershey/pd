__Letter "Three couples were married and stayed at the same hotel for their honeymoons, where they were all taken care of by Dave the Bellboy. The first man married a nurse. Dave showed them to their room and thought to himself, \"What a lucky guy. Nurses are known to be hot to trot\".The second man married a telephone operator. Dave showed them to their room and thought to himself,” Wow, he's a lucky one. Telephone operators have sexy voices and once you pop that top button...A-bomb.”The third man married a school teacher. Dave showed them to their room and thought to himself, \"Poor guy, she's pretty but teachers are just too frigid\".The next morning, Dave reported to work at 5:30 in the morning. He expected only the teacher's husband to call for breakfast any minute and the other two would call much later in the day.At 6:00 a.m. the phone rang. It was the nurse's husband wanting breakfast. The nurse's husband opened the door and Dave stepped back in shock. The man's pajamas were still pressed and his hair nicely combed. Dave asked, \"What happened sir? You married a nurse.The man sourly replies, \"Son, don't ever marry a nurse. All I heard last night was her nagging voice saying, “You’re not sanitary, and you’re not sanitary.\"At 6:30 a.m., the phone rang again.The telephone operator's husband called for breakfast. Dave brought it as fast as possible hoping for the best. The man opened the door and Dave stepped back in shock. The man's hair and pajamas were properly combed and pressed.Dave asked,\" What happened? Telephone operators are supposed to be as sexy as their voices.\" The man sourly replies \"Son, don't ever marry a telephone operator. All I heard last night was her nasal voice saying, \"You're three minutes are up, your three minutes are up.\" Dave went back down to the desk, just knowing the teacher’s husband would be calling any minute.Finally at 4:30 p.m., the teacher's husband called for breakfast.Dave can't believe it but quickly took the breakfast to the couple’s room. The man opened the door and Dave took a step back in shock. The man was wearing only his boxers, his hair was a mess, and he had scratch marks on his chest, arms and legs.Joe fearing the worst asked “What happened to you? Did you have a fight?\" The man smiled and happily replied, \"No. Son, when you marry, be sure to marry a school teacher. All I heard last night was her sexy smooth voice saying \"We are going to do this over and over, until we get right.\""
