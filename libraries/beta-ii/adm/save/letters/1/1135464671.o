__Letter "Levi was unidle when people were harassing me big time on lines, not as carina, as samantha. and this is against the rules.  he told me that he didnt care if people harrassed me, and that he doesnt have time to deal with it, while he was unidle mind you.  Levi is a terrible immortal, today he arrested people and dested some for stupid reasons and he is becoming a dictator and many people are boycotting the mud.  If you want players to stay, you may want to get rid of him.  I am just saying."
