__Letter "KK just a quick little angel balance stuff.Holyfire:   Faith x 1.5 + wis x 4  - Target's int x 2.5   Lot of damage still... but the missing of a round when a mob dies/leaves room makes up for that. plus its considerably weaker now (i did 1k at lvl 50 with 20s in stats) and it is a quest race after allLevin:   MA x 2.5 + Int x 5 + wis x 2   -   Target's int x 2.5   Damage might seem crazy but this spell takes 3 rounds. 1 to cast, 1 to build power, 1 to hit. In this time i could lifewarp twice (1.5k damage) or thornwrack 3 times.   Would be a nice magic user spell for opening (only take 2 rounds of damage instead of 3 if levin is used as an opening spell) with a large damage ammount. All in all it wouldnt be more useful than a normal spell for exping howeverJust my thoughts-- Ash"
