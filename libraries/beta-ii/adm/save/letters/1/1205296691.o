__Letter "I copied all the files into /wizards/rull/senses/. Peruse and installwhen you have time. sensecmd.c should go in /std/obj/,senses.c room.c object.c should go in /std/, and the commandsshould all go in /cmds/mortal/. I hope it all works, I didn't test iton builders yet. Any major issues just let me know, but those arejust copied right from main port (except a few lines in room.c whichwere an experiment by Daboura - I took them out in the copy)."
