__Letter "Hi, it's me Rayna, I didn't realize that I had made Xylia awhileago and then suicided her, she was married to Malenung forsome reason. So, I won't be using xylia, I'll be using thisone. I want to be a rogue assassin. Please don't tell anyone,because I need time to sort through this all and I don't want\"anyone\" knowing who I am. Hugs,Rayna"
