__Letter "I have not been able to play in this playtest or the one before it, but Helena informs me that chaoswave has been significantly downgraded for the plytest. Since this is the best spell necros have, I would like ot request against a downgrade. However, I would be more open to a downgrade of chaoswave if the elite spells were improved, and soulburn actually was an elite level spell. I feel sure that several other necro players agree with me on this.Scourge"
