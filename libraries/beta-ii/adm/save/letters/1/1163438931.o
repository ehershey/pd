__Letter "I have written a command called _objcmds.c for builders.I was originally going to include this functionality insideof _summary.c but decided to make the commands that an objectgrants into it's own command. Combining this functionalitywith the reports from _summary.c will again speed up thereview process.EX ==If we see they used add_action() to assign a function inan object, we can see if it was warrented. Also it will,point out for us when they could have done it with anobject pointer in set_wear(), set_remove(), set_hit(),set_items(), set_long(), etc....Personally i don't care for the add_action() method ofgranting a command due to the fact that it will maskany other command by that name already granted by thesystem.... As such, I will be training builders to usefunction pointers whenever humanly possiable and useadd_action() if there is no other way of doing it.The combination of _objcmds.c and _summary.c will workwonders on making sure a builder's code is clean,functional and efficent.... hence not lagging the mudor interfering with other commands.Ironman"
