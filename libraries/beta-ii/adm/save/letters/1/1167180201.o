__Letter "im not gonna lie and say im not a little upset about arcanis being promoted to guild leader.  I do believe that he will do well and I do not think your decision was wrongHowever, just the other day you gave me attitude and all about me not talking to you about even inducting people into the Last Saints, and I've always come to you when it comes to stuff such as guild leader. I'm not so much mad but I'm hurt, hurt that you didn't even include me at all, when i've included you. Hurt that you gave me shit the other day about the members thing and then you promote someone to leader without even so much as telling me.Again, I'm not mad, I'm just hurt...makes me feel like you don't trust me or value my opinion, when I have yours.Samantha"
