__Letter "Woot! I finally typed up my char desc for Scourge. :) It took *sooo* long to do, not only because it's long, but because i had to use telnet. (eek). I was gonna try to have alternating colors on some words, but that just got to be too easy to mess up, so Ijust used plain colors. :) My desc still has one typo in it, but i can't be bothered typing it all up in telenet again just to delete a single letter. I can't wait to show it off to you! :)See you in a little while honey :)*mkiss* :D"
__Undeleted ({"aziraphale",})
