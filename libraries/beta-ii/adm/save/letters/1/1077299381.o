__Letter "I'll talk to galdur and try and get him to be nicer...  but even if he just called her fat, she'll need to get over it.  I dont mean to be insensitive, but she'll have to learn to deal with people not being nice.  It's a part of life.  She didnt harass log anything, so I dont know anything about how he was bothering her earlier.  and if he's saying things to her she doesnt like, she can always use the ignore command."
