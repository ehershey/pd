__Letter "Dude, since I know you're not gonna be off the phone for like 50 friggin hours, and you probably won't check last tell, I'll mail this to you =P. But err, ya didn't you have a 20 dollar check and a 25 dollar check? I think it's kinda fucked up that you probably spent the whole 25 dollar check then the 20 dollar, even tho you've owed me for 2 weeks then, now it's 3 weeks. That's kinda messed up.-Deathshroud is still kinda pissed"
