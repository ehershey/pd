__Letter "Hey stormy, i'm the new leader of blacksail, I know there arent any updates being made, but I was wondering if you could allow daos to add a few, standard things to our guild hall, at the moment all we have is one room and a board, i'd just like to add one more room, with a mob that sells oils and stones and a locker, thats it. I understand completely if this goes against the no update rule, but I figured i'd ask since it's standard stuff and i'm not asking for a Haxsw0rd+1 :Pthanks, Agent"
