__Letter "We had it set up so all the other domains/subdomains on the server where included in one login I could get to through ftp. Those included: tijir.com, tommyjreynolds.com, xnaportal.com, gallery.grandgravey.com, numberonervpark.com or number1rvpark.com (one is forwarded). The login name was tijirweb and the password should be rijits123I am not sure how to set it up else I would do it. Once you get it done I will be happy to keep a local copy in case something like this happens again though.Stormy"
