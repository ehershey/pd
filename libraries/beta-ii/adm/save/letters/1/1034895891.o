__Letter "I'm sorry. I know you want me to leave you alone.. so just read this when you've calmed down.I want to start off by saying that I'm extremely sorry for what I said. It wasn't right of me to take your help for granted how I did. I'm sorry for being such a bitch and whining at you. I shouldn't have done that.. no matter how frustrated I got. I can't tell you I'm sorry enough and still expect you to forgive me.. so if you ever decide to just know I'm still here.. and I miss having you as my friend.Yours truly,Sugarcandy"
