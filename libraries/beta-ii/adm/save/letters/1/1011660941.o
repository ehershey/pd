__Letter "I had one bug brought to my attention by Ashram, that disease severs all limbs. I know that Makaveli has been using an attack like that to kill lodos temple, tenebrae including the castle, and in merk while he was a in the teens lvl.Needless to say that has been a long time, and I dont know if he bugged it and kept using it or didnt bug it at all."
