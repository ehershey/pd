__Letter "Ok, no problem, have fun. :)I posted on newbie just as you left last night and I said \"Nenet staplesEscobar\".  That's when he asked me, so I must play my alts the same way,so Nenet will only post game stuff on newbie line.  Am I that obvious? lolShe'll just be shy and quiet and a role-player.  I will make a few other alts to try out the different classes/races, butwill use Nenet and Xenia for the main ones. Have fun.  N"
