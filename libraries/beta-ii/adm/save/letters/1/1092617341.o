__Letter "Well. If its the juggling balls you are speaking of. I have a few thoughts.First I was wondering if it could be wearable so other people copuld see it if they looked at me.   As for the name if ys dont mind doing colors a mix of the dark purple blue and green would be nice.  :DI'm not sure how the item can work really since I can easily pose the tricks. Though with my typing skills it might be better to have the set commands ;) Well here are a few of my favorite tricks.:Dregs toss one his four juggling  balls behind it back. It spins in a terrific arc coming back over his shoulder to join the other three.:lets one of the dancing orbs fall but at the last moment, kicks it back up into th air to be danced between his hands again:meh and for a finisher I usually toss the orbs up caching them in a tower atop my cap, not tha anyone on this mud bloody cares about my performances :P"
