__Letter "Im beginning to wonder if the bug isnt caused by the seals.  That autoload bug tracker seems to keep reporting that players are losing seals, doesnt matter if there blank or not.  Ive told them to start keeping a count and mail me and you when they notice some missing.  If you wanna check the auto logs, its in /wizards/whit/auto/ and the players name as the file name.  To read the missing eq, use <tail [name] (2)> otherwise it will bug out more because some can be rather large.Whit"
