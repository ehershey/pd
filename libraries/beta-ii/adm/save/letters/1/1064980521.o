__Letter "Is it possible for one guild to be in control of a secondary guild. They would have two seperate lines, and members of the main guild can hear both, but members of subguild can only hear their line. Leaders and Councilors for main guild count for both.I thought of this as a way to counteract guild spies. We could add them to the subguild at first, and that way they don't have access to the main guild, or the main guild line, and it would allow main guild members to keep an eye on them and stuff. It also means I can add people to my subguild, and have them enjoy benefits of gaining protection of main guild members etc, but they don't have access to our main chat, or any of the truly special guild rooms and items.This will discourage spies as they can't get any good info as soon as they are inducted, or evne possibly for a long long time after that.As for leader commands, the leaders of Main guild can use all commands just as they do know for Main guild, and to do commands for Subguild they just use 'subguild' as a prefix. So <subguild induct jacer> <subguild promote jacer> and so on. Members of main guild can also <subguild members> and <subguild members -o>.Like for wolfspirits reputation idea, it sounds pretty easy to code, just implementing it could be a pain. It'd take a little work, but not too much would it?I got this idea because Acheron has no guild leader, and I feel like buying it and using it as a subguild.p~Pheh, woops.Aziraphale."
