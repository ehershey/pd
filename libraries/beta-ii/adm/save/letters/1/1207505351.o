__Letter "Hi, sorry about last night.  I was still very groggy and going in and outof things, and then I fell off my chair onto my butt lolI slept for 11 hours again.  Wow, that is so not like me, but Trevor saidit's because my body needs the sleep.  I will be on and off today and would like to spend time with you.  I miss you.  Once I am feeling better,it will be easy to connect with you on here.  Then I should be able to sitlonger and focus better.  That is part of it, I can't focus too much or concentrate on things.  Love, yourRayna"
