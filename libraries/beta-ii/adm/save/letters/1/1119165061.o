__Letter "Item: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Leather Sheath%^RESET%^A %^GREEN%^durable %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^leather sheath%^RESET%^ that ties to your upper leg.  It appears that it can accommodate any sized %^RED%^knife%^RESET%^ or %^BOLD%^%^RED%^dagger%^.%^RESET%^The sheath is %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^empty.      %^RESET%^ [When empty]The sheath is %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^full.        %^RESET%^[When it has a knife in it]Commands should be <sheath [knife/dagger]> or <sheath [knife/dagger] into sheath [sheath #]>            (\"Sheath\" is the actual item, where as \"Sheathe\" is to put the item INTO the sheath-ie 'Sheathe a sword'-I double checked to make sure i had the right terms.) So the command is indicated that the knife is being put into the sheath, not that you are sheathing the knife as an action.Reverse commands should be the same thing <unsheath [knife/dagger]> or <unsheath [knife/dagger] from sheath [sheath #]> .If <POSSIBLE> could you make it so that a knife in the sheath won't be lost if you log out with one in there.That's all! Thanks a lot Daos!-Beleqwaya the Shadow"
