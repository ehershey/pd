__Letter "Some nights silently it creeps inYour skin still thick, Your weak withinSoul stolen welcome to my worldIll unfurl nightmare till death has its holdIntangible taunts haunting each breathI never left but you did, How ironic i guessBut still none the less we each are oneWith black we show our rainbowCome one, Come all have some funYet we will get the last laughThey end up broken like us allOnce something, Now..We smile as they fallSo the moonlight flickers through the ruin,Your hair highlighted by its illumination,It flickers softly as ghostly tunes play,from not a radio station.But from the dance we dance on the stones,blood red petals fall,and now the castle wall though broken and tornstill stands stronger than ever, our stagewhen the moonlight shines through the glaze of the windowsand the music echos from the wallswe kiss our last kiss and vanish two ghostswhich crawled from hell and heavens claws.Brian - Drink Deep ;)"
