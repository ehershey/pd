__Letter "You hear a terrible howl as Leviathas is slain.Fallen leaves north.Leviathas enters.Autosaving.Leviathas leaves north.A scream is heard across the land as Leviathas dies.Fallen enters.Fallen inhales the breath of Asmodeus!Fallen fishes through his pockets examining some money.Leviathas enters.Leviathas leaves west.Fallen leaves west.Leviathas enters.Leviathas leaves east.Leviathas enters.Leviathas leaves south.You hear a terrible howl as Leviathas is slain."
