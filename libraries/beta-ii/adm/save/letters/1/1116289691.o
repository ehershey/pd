__Letter "Lyric:Hey Bosco, what did you do To make so many men hate you You think you're right, they say you're wrong They've been hassling you for way too long [Chorus:]Going out it made you a star Going out but going too far Going out expressing your point of view [Verse 2:]Hey Bosco, what did you do To make so many cops want you They think they're right you say they're wrong They've been hassling you for way too long [Chorus][Verse 3:](Point of view) Well I don't want to fake it And I know you're gonna make it But you don't have to take it all... "
