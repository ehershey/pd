__Letter " Well, i'm not officially back from my trip yet. I'm still on the trip, just borrowing my brother-in-law's computer. ;)  I'll be leaving tomorrow afternoon. I can't really be online for more than about 30 minutes at a time, here, but it's not so bad. I just can't wait to get home so I can be up all night.  :) See you for now,Savannah"
