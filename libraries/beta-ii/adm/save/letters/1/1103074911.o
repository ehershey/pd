__Letter "Billions of stars strung across the sky.but something about this one caught my eye,Perhaps the radiant beauty, oh shines so bright.a slow steady flicker in the failing moonlightI listen to her sweet soft whisperacheing simply to kiss her.So much distance between you and I.But our loves reaches further than anyone could fly.What will it take to hold this star as mine.If there's one thing I have to much of, it's time.Her light will eventually reach me,couldn't give her a mansion, nor repeat a simple moment.All i can promise is,No matter where that star is in the endless sea of darknessMy heart forever burns, forever reachs closer,To the star that caught my eye, that lonely summer night."
