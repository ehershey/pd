__Letter "I'm on telnet right now...  but hopefully this will turn out.  I've got a lot to tell you too...  we had a good time RPing this weekend, and I had a very curious dream that I've been wanting to tell you about.  sounds like your trip went well, I'm glad it did.  I've missed you terribly, I'll be looking forward to seeing you again!  *hugs you tightly and gives you a smooch*  love ya."
