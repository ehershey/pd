__Letter "I was talkin to daos about all the different classes, he was trying to pick a class to start a player with, and  I recommended raknid or centaur. It got me to thinking, it would be nice if each race had a good reason to be picked, maybe like a species bonus or ability for each racefor exampleminotaurs could gore, it would just be weaker than a demon goreelves could automatically get +1 magic attack and def per lvl when they pick magehumans could get a weapon specialization skill that allowed them +1 more skill point per level in a weapon of thier choicesome of the less charasmatic races, like ogres goblins or orcs could get like natural fear abilities that go off randomly in combat and have different degrees of status effects based on levels, i.e. paralysis, temporary loss in stats, being put to sleep etcgremlins could get a dodge bonus where regardless of level skills or stats they dodge attacks and abilities due to a size modifierThese are all off the top of my head.. if you like the idea at all I will read all the race help files and try and brainstorm some really good ideas that I can run over with daos, and when we're complete we could send it to youlemme know what ya thinkDubbya"
