__Letter "Well, it seems as rogues get bigger they start to slow down exp wise heavily...maybe its just me, but i propose this crappy idea...ability: cutthroatlevel obtained: 65-70 (whatever seems fit)damgage based on: dexterity, murder, agilitysucuess/failure based on: your stealth vs. their perception, your dex vs. their dexterityAutosaving.Desc: this ability is for extreamly skilled rogues. The skilled rogue slips behind his foe and pulls back his head, slitting their throat causing extreme damage. This should be an opening move that is greater than backstab. This ability should be very sucuess/fail dependant on the rogues stealth and dex. during a failure, the rogue should be paralyzed for several round due to being elbowed/kicked/thrown. Also, due to the extreame deadlyness of this ability, it should only be able to use on mobs and possibly in the arena.note: all rogues should get this."
