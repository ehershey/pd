__Letter "Daos has a player character -- not for Levi's RP thing, but just to play -- named Riven. According to Daos, Levi knew about it. I suggest ridding it. As for Daos?Daos <cre> Well, I have a confession to make.A shadow <cre> Oh?Daos <cre> Yes, I have a character.  I know the rule that is not in writing,but immortals can't have player characters.  I wanted to find out if mycharacter had to be dested.  The name is Riven.Daos <cre> Levi knows.Daos <cre> I don't play both characters at the same time.  It was a character Icreated one night.A shadow <cre> Umm.... not sureA shadow <cre> probably thoughA shadow <cre> Unless you're only using him for RP, like with Levi's thingDaos <cre> Yeah, it is not RP... it was a player character not for anyparticular purpose.A shadow <cre> I'll leave it up to DabouraDaos <cre> Alright"
