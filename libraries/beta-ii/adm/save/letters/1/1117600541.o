__Letter "I saw you online yesterday, but I was only online for a mometn with me daddyo. He came to visit me here. fun fun fun... yeah - I miss you too. I have been thinking about you a lot.  Japan is craaazy... I:ve been running aroun doing so many things, I cant keep track. BUT, as i posted publicly, i found a great internet cafe called Con Pana in Tenmonkon shopping arcade. New machines, custom built. you can choose for gaming, study, etc. its fun and i get my own private little cubicle. free drinks, cheap food. They also have game systems that they rent out here for really cheap... With all the newest japanese games. I bet you know where i:ll be spending my free times!!!! *)anyway, i:ll be around more often now... mainly late at night your time... but maybe sometimes early enough to catch you. keep your eyes peeled! Love Jenna"
