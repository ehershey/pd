__Letter "for my xmas present. i want ring that has a crimson stone in it. and for the descrip. As you look into the stone. You see the past of many white paladin's fighting hords of demons to keep this world safe. As you watch the vision's the ring shows. You notice it focuses on one particular paladin. You look closer for a better look and you notice who it was. It was the greatest paladin who brought down the demon king. And the paladins name is. Shizim. if i cant have that descrip. then just leave it blank. and ill think of something better. thats all. and make it to where only i can wherre it. and if i die. i will still have it.. if its posible. that is all. thank you. shizim.p.s. This mud rocks!"
