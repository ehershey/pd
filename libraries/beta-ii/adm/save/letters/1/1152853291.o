__Letter "Heya Stormy, sorry if I'm bothering you at all, just had an idea/request to run by you. You know how all rogues are evil because their inits cause them to be? Well, I was wondering if you could turn that part off, because I think it'd be neat to see some difference. I mean....where does it say that rogues have to be evil? I mean, I do think about it and notice that assassins seem evil, thugs yes, thieves especially, but, do they really have to be evil? Just a thought, because also I think it'd be neat to see some angel rogues outside of Tyste who just did it for show I think.Thank you,Vayne"
