__Letter "Little bit of balance stuff i've found.Fighters on the whole are good (defense on hard mobs keeps em from being crazy). But paladin/antipaladin with boost is a bit too strong because of boost. It means they can use slash (by far the strongest skill) wihtout ever having to deal with the high sp cost of it. Raknid fighters are very very overpowered. My fighter was the equivelant of being able to backstab a monster every round and then getting 7 normal attacks on top of it. I could insta-kill 26k monsters and 35k monsters died in 2 rounds. Plus i actually took much less damage as a raknid than as a gnoll (better armour on raknids for me). Pyro and Necro level 50 spells are very very strong.Pyro spell scorch is very strong (4 hours to lvl from 1 to hm). Inferno on the other hand could use a little set up (does less damage than my scorch at lvl 30).Thanks stormy :)-- Ashram"
