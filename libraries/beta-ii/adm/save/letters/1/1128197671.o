__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Summer to Summer Sat Oct  1 16:12:33 2005:-----Hello from the noobI write to you as a request for more skills. I understand that it is late in the game to add in skills but I would like to point out some good reasons to add in these skills:Climbing - the more skill= the better and more efficent you are to climb or scale anything without falling.Swimming - the more skill =  the further the distance you can swim without assistance and the deeper in water you can go.Fishing - the more skill = the further you cast more and bigger fish you can get, espcially helpful at low levels since it is basically free food.under help attack, it would look like:attack          - A player's mastery of weapon combat.charging        - A racial skill for centaurs and weimics, affects                   charging attacks.defense         - A player's mastery of the arts of self-defense.double wielding - A player's mastery of combat with two wielded weapons.melee           - A player's mastery of hand to hand combat.rage            - A berserker's mastery of his rage.riding          - A fighter's mastery of riding a horse, affects                   charging attacks.climbing 	- A player's mastery of scaling rocks and moutain terrain.swimming 	- A player's mastery of the art of water.fishing		- A player's mastery of fishing for bigger fish.To demonstrate how each class could be set up with these skills, it could look similar to: climbing - fighter & wanderer (easiest to train), rogue (nominal training costs), clergy & mage (hardest to train)swimming - rogue & wanderer (easiest to train), clergy & mage (nominal training costs), fighter (hardest to train)fishing - fighter, rogue, wanderer, clergy, mage (nominal training costs to everyone)\"Skills are studied and mastered.  Depending on the class you choose, you will spend your time studying individual skills to become as good at your class as one may become.  Unfortunately, no class is able to master all skills.  You master skills by gaining experience and studying the skills orby using spells and abilities that help you to master the skills involved.\"Those are just my thoughts and reasons for adding those to help this mud become the best it can be. -the noob, Summer"
