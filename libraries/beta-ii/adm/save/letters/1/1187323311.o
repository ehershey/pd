__Letter "Ok here is the deal, as some of you may know Shadowmud is being remade.  Dusk, Terok and Caine are the immortals doing the work. Terok and Caine are the Admin. She is putting in old guilds in and has said that she can put new guilds in also if she gets 4 people online to say the want to make a guild. Dusk will put it in and right now there is no cost that I know of since they are in the creation part of building the new Mud. I am told by Terok that it will be a mixture of old shadowmud, devel and something new. I am suggestion we bring the Darksouls over to shadowmud. All we will need to do is mud mail her. The address is portent.genesismuds.com 1030. Mud Mail Dusk.Yetron"
