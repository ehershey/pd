__Letter "Someone put in the lock terminal command this year.  When i looked at the code when it asked for password,  you had to type blah.  Well,  I went ahead and fixed it.  It should now work.  It has some nice logging parts to it say for example,  while you are away, someone tried to guess your password 3 times.  When you enter your password,  it will tell you:  Warning!  3 Password attempts have failed.  Or something like that.  Tell me if i should tell the players that the command exists.Whit"
