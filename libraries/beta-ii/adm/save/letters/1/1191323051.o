__Letter "i noticed a missing work in my last one, i only started it b/c it was cool.  Then the other few times I did it, one was for a person that was talking about multiplaying in a room I was cloaked in.  The other was b/c some was going to help someone hold items on anther character and then give them back on a differnt alt, which is another form of multiplay and I was able to stop them from it that time.  I wont however lie and say it was all koesher.  But for the majority of the few times I did it, it was for a reason.  I do apologize though, and I won't use the gettell command again.  Can I ask a question?  Why is gettell in the game if it shouldn't be used.  Why not just keep snoop?  As far as snoop went, I don't even have that command.And Noxus must have guessed what happened, b/c I for sure did not tell him, I did not even tell Piehl or Furiae."
