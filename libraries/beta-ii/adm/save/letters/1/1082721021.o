__Letter "i have no idea what it should be called :P but i was thinking, that since it takes time to cast this aura (taking longer as it gets more powerful) i think it would be really neat if there were messages as you 'prayed' and the messages could get more complex as you advance in power (or 'favour' with your diety i guess :P). just an idea."
