__Letter "Normally when someone wants to join the guild, I will just let them in.  But as I stated in my first mail to you, I had to confide in my council members.  This guild is a neutral guild, I try to get everyone involved with the mud as a whole, just not the guild.  Although the guild ties are strong.  It makes me sad that one person can wreak it for so many other people, but that usually becomes the case with everything that happens.The council member decided that, if you want to join the guild, you have to prove yourself to the other guild members that you are the right person for the guild.  As I stated earlier, I encourage everyone to take part in the mud as a whole, which means, some of them code, some of them come up with ideas for the coders, and all others try to learn as much of the mud as possible.  I hope this helps you define your role for the guild, if you still wish to join.  Good luck!"
