__Letter "So each individual only killed you once?The ten day rule was for a single player reapetedly killing the same person, not that a player couldn't be pked more than once in a ten day period. If it is because they are of the same guild, there is no posted rule on this that I can find anywhere. I have, however, updated the pk rules to include guild harassment.I will talk with them, may even arrest them for a 10 day period but technically they only broke a spoken rule that existed before we changed the pk system. That spoken rule was in effect before we were down and I do not truely remember the exact rule, didn't remember anything about it until you told me about it.StormyStormy"
