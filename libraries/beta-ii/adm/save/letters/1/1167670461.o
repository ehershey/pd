__Letter "Don't let these jackasses get to you bud. Most will never comprehendwhat people who can, for lack of a better word, think in code cando. I personally understand cause i to can code in multiple langs.Thats why i mastered LPC within under a year. I still want you toteach me about the class datatype tho :PProblem is that the average person don't WANT to know just how badthe gov't is fucking over the people. Reason is they feel totallypowerless to do anything to change it.... Hence they attack themessanger, you, and not the message :(I know what the gov't has done better then most. My father is amarine drill instructor. I work for a homeless organization in NYCas a manager.... i know ALL to well how bad it is.....I could tell you horror stories from the job that would make JerrySpringer have nightmares. The old saying holds true. A man doesn'tunderstand the plight of another until they walked a mile in theirshoes. In the case of what i do for a living, slept three nights inanother man's cardboard box :( It's pathetic how the gov't caststhe weak and poor to the curb....I understand what you were pointing out. I'm pointing out the resultsof what they have done.... and it's been going on for a LONG time.Ironman"
