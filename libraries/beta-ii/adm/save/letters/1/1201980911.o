__Letter "Hey love, I didnt go to sleep yet. I tend to try to cram in much moreon my days off. :( As a result, I need to head to bed pronto! I plan tobe awake around 5pm your time. It won't be easy so I will get my sisteras backup. :) I talked to my mom this morning. Myra hinted that I hadsomething to tell her about you. My mom said 'You didnt propose, didyou?\" I said 'Nooooo, I gotta make her my girlfriend before I ask herthat. So, now, I got a girlfriend. Should I ask her to marry me now?\"And then she said \"Noooo, not yet.\" She mentioned that I might be feeling pressure since everybody else is married including my superyoung niece. Anyway, I will tell you more around 5pm your time, if you are so inclined. :) Also, if I am slow getting on, you may wannalog out and back in every minute or so, play your song a few timesand you'd be sure to reach me even in deepest slumber, methinks. :)Anyway, that was part of my morning. Tell ya more later. :DLove,James"
