__Letter "Hiya,Lots of crap just went down in AoD.  Namely Autema and Necrite ganging up on Wisp and booting her from the guild.  Anyway Cookie logged on and reinstated her and they left.  Autema was the bunny who would divulge information about Ds, so that's no big loss.  It's just Gob and I in there now.  But to stop people from trying to join to snoop on Ds, i spoke to Wraith and we agreed that AoD and Darksouls should part company.  Autema is pretty pissy with Wisp i think, so she is probably high on his list for pk but oh well, i didn't do anything wrong.  Even after the crap they pulled i wasn't going to remove them and they left of their own accordAnyway i just thought you should know what was happeningWisp"
