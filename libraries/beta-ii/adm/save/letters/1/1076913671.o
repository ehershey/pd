__Letter "*cheers*  Well, monday between 6 and 11ish...  I'm never really sure when I'll be home though :(  It's ok that it's a little late ;)  I've been real sick last night and today...  I'm doing a little better this evening...  but I still am feeling a bit nausious.  Its like I have a dizzy spell that wont end.  Hopefully I'll feel better tomorrow cause I'll be looking forward to hearing from you!  ^_^  I'll try to hang out around the apartment tomorrow afternoon so I'll be home."
