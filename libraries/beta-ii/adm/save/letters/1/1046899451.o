__Letter "Here's my report on monks at 20 and my recommendations:All abilities are roughly the same speed at killing. The rate of killing is equivalant to a swashbuckler at this level. I dont know exactly which move is meant to be the main one at this level. I use circlekick because it does the most damage. Circlekick is balanced for this level.Crushingblow needs to be looked at. Its an opening attack but does almost nothing. Perhaps Str*2 + melee + attack for its damage would work.Stuntouch is nice.Supplication and ironskin are also nice. Same with heal.If circlekick is not supposed to be the main attack at lvl 20 then snapkick, ironfist, or openpalm needs an upgrade. They are fine up till 20 though.Furystrike i believe gets better later on like bladedance. I'd recommend upping the damage a little bit (by about 25%). It takes a lot of sp for very slow killing atm. The big issue with monks at high levels (who should use furystrike) comes in that they will be testing it in the arena... Well that makes AC changes very noticeable as if you fight a big person who is buffered and has good armour then you wont do damage. For example Tyste's furystike does 0 to me. Then again Joey's flameclaw also does 0. Its not because the moves are too weak nessissarily, but because arena is not an accurate measuire of a person's exp power.I'll keep playing and let you know how it goes"
