__Letter "I made the hm and elite flails, but the descriptions, colors, special messages, and equip/unequip messages are lacking or nonexistant.  If you wanna think up something cool, hit me back with your ideas.  The flail has a chance to trip the opponent, if you want to write messagesfor those, there needs to be a message for what the wielder sees, what his opponent sees, and what the onlookers see.If you're cool with doing this, i'll whip up some axes or somethin and have you write the important parts of those too.Hit me back when you can."
