__Letter "K. Well we've deceided that we want an extra guild room. I've got some special requests for it. I dunno if we're allowed to have it, but I wanna send it to you anyway.The room description is:You have entered the Scorpio louge. This is the place where members of Scorpio can buy food drinks, sit back and hang out. Just south of here is are the barracks, where members of Scorpio can sleep. You hear alot of talking and laughing, and the strong smell of alcohol lingers in the air.I'm not sure if we can do this, but also in the room, you can order drinks and food. There's also a table and chairs to sit in.In the room south of this (as described in the description) are the barracks. There description is:This is the barracks of the Scorpio guild. Around you, you see many beds, each with the name of a member of the guild inscribed on them. The room is kept very clean, the leaders would not allow there guild to look like a pig sty. (not sure if that's spelt right). If you wish to sleep on a bed simply (lay bed). and in the room thing (like in the square it say a fountain, an old tattered board, and a pit are here.) It says a bed is here.I dunno if we can do that, but if we can I'd much apreciate it if you'd do that :).Luv ya,Mocha :)."
