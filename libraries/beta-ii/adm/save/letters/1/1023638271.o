__Letter "Letter 16:Sat Jun  8 18:42:10 2002 from WhitTo: Stormbringer Subject: Security HazardWell as usual i can usually find security hazards...  Well i just found a bigone.  In /std/living.c there is a function add_search_path(string str);  thatfunction will add \"str\" as a searchpath for commands.  But the problem is ifcould use <call me;add_search_path;/cmds/adm> and i would have the admincommands.  There is no security.  There is security for removing them..  Toremove you must have the uid of Root.  Just thought i would tell you.Your faithful servant,  WhitStormy"
