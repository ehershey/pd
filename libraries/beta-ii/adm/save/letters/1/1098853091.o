__Letter "[26-04 21:28:2]Nulvect <newbie> my opinion of the entire administration justwent way down the toiletI've seen your posts as well.  I'll tell you what.  My opinion of YOU has already been down the toilet.  Do you care?  I'm sure they don't either.  So why dont you just stfu and either play and make *suggestions* and not posts about how you're a whiny little bitch and have no respect for people that VOLUNTEER their time OR...  leave.  If it's really that bad, go play something that's so much better.  If you cant find something better, then I return to my original option of just shutting your cake hole.  Just thought I'd let you know what *I* thought of *you* since you like to regularly announce what you think of the staff.                         -Nightshade"
