__Letter "%^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^You have entered the house of the LouNahTic's. Yes, the LouNahTic's. You are standing in the living room. As you look around you see weapons, magic books, and pictures of loved ones all over the room. There is a small, round table with a long couch and a few chairs on your right. From what you can tell, there's a part of a drow's leg and a few pieces of some kind of animals you have never seen before. Looks like dinner. Above your head is an enchanted ceiling painted to look likes a mid-summer night sky. You peer left and see heads of the LouNahTic's enemies nailed to spears and posted near the window. Blood is still dipping from one of them. The gruesome image forces you to look away and turn to a flight of stairs leading up. Above are four rooms with signs on each door. The signs read: %^BLUE%^Mathiu%^WHITE%^, %^RED%^Dragoth%^WHITE%^, %^YELLOW%^Alchemon%^WHITE%^, and %^GREEN%^Pilsipher%^WHITE%^. You decide to enter one of them to see what's inside.,"
