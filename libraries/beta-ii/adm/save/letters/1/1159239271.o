__Letter "hey, i gave this idea to whit but i wanted you to see it to.  it is weird to read b/c it came from MSN messenger, but understandable:archive postingso that i can keep the boards somewhat clean after a certain pointBUT, people can read the archivesso say we have retarded postsi would be able to \"delete #\" and they would NOT be archivedand then for the important ones, i could \"archive #\"  and they WOULD be archivedand then people could look through if they need to refer to a postfor like conversations and ideas etcok and there it is, just want to see what you think of it as well"
