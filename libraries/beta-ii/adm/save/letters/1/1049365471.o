__Letter "Caladan enters.A shadow says: May your skin rot and your bones break!A shadow points at you and sends a stream of green liquid at you.  Youimmediatly feel more sick then you ever have.  Your insides churn as if you'rebeing eaten from the inside out.You stumble, trying to keep your balance even as your body churns inside ofyou.Wisp falls to one knee, coughing up blood as her skin starts to turn a chalkywhite from the ravishings of the disease.westIt is bright.The walls are empty and the ground spotless. The silent and   | [ ]     majestic silence of the turret more than makes up for it's    |    \\  +lack of decor. Dim light and a white tower gives an almost    |     [X]-[*]romantic air to the temple's turrets. The appearance of the   |      | turret is greatly majestic, even though the night darkness    |     [*] makes it hard to see all of the room. There are four obvious exits:  south, east, up, and northwest.Gob (mounting Wisp)hp: 524|sp: 242|mp: 1150 >  You stumble, trying to keep your balance even as your body churns inside ofyou.Wisp falls to one knee, coughing up blood as her skin starts to turn a chalkywhite from the ravishings of the disease.nwIt is bright.Shadows play across the room, with candle light flickering in |     [ ] from the north and west. A marble passage goes southeast into |      | an outlook of some sort that reaches just above the tower.    | [ ]-[X]The night air is cool within the confines of the temple. The  |        \\onyx walls have been cut out for several windows on the       |         [ ]southern wall. There are three obvious exits:  north, west, and southeast.Gob (mounting Wisp)hp: 176|sp: 241|mp: 1150 >  You stumble, trying to keep your balance even as your body churns inside ofyou.Wisp falls to one knee, coughing up blood as her skin starts to turn a chalkywhite from the ravishings of the disease.northIt is bright.This room is the east-most side of the main portion of this   |     [*] magnificent temple. Darkness casts quite an eerie shadow upon |      | this temple room. All of the normally white and grey walls    |     [X]and floor have turned a dark grey and black from the night    |      | shadows. Tapestries line the western wall and stained glass   |     [ ] windows the eastern. There are two obvious exits:  north, and south.Gob (mounting Wisp)hp: -172|sp: 241|mp: 1150 >  Gob dismounts off of you.You hear a terrible howl as Wisp is slain.                                _,.-----.,_                             ,-~           ~-.                           ,^___           ___^.                          /~\"   ~\"   .   \"~   \"~\\                         Y  ,--._    I    _.--.

Thefigure seems to be an old and powerful spirit. The spirit has two firey pinpoints for eyes, but is otherwise undiscernable besides a long shadowy robe.You stumble, trying to keep your balance even as your body churns inside ofyou.Wisp falls to one knee, coughing up blood as her skin starts to turn a chalkywhite from the ravishings of the disease.The Spirit says: Wisp.. Rubicante has struck you down?"
