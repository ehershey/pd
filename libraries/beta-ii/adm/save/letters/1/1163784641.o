__Letter "In addition to the security change i wanna do, I want to permitthe builders to be able to snoop one another if and only if theyare in a group together. Archs and admins would retain the abilityto snoop regardless.BTW ..... archp() checks for membership in the superuser group.          the only way to make a person archwizard is to add them          to that group.          admp() checks for membership in the rootuser group.Ironman"
