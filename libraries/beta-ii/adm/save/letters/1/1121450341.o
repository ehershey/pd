__Letter "One that you probably aren't authorized to do yourself, but I think that all quest races should be their own class.  There seem to be far too many balance issues with quest race and class combinations, i.e. demon fighters dealing out uberdamage.EXP caps, per minute and per hour.  If someone gains an obscene amount of EXP during this time (lets say more than double the documented 'record' for EXPing) then they are logged and the Law enforcers can review that log and possibly press charges.  Even if that person isn't cheating, their class or subclass may be extremely unbalanced.  It's useful information to know.I would like to see guilds wiped down to the basics.  Customized Oil/Stones and one customized item.  They're purely cosmetics, with no additional attributes or potency of any kind.  It would also be cool if guilds could have their own pits for sharing items.  People may complain that guilds were meant to be powerful, but 'Strength in numbers' IS a really good perk.Maybe some system where demons and angels are injured in some way if they don't attack each other on sight.  Their gods are displeased, and one of their attributes becomes weaker, or 'tainted'.  There could be something like this for every quest race or class, where if they don't at least adhere to what their history and what the help file describes as their behaviour, then they suffer some sort of penalty.Criminal flags - If you attack an innocent person, that alone turns you into a criminal, and you are fair game to that person for a certain amount of time.  You can kill anyone who has attacked you, in self defense, without becoming a criminal for doing so.Quest races having some attribute that represents the Lion's Share of their power.  This attribute is relative to the population number.  So the more demons there are, for example, the weaker they become on a basic level.  This would be a really nice encouragement for people not to leak quest info, and for coders to make DIFFICULT quests if they want the race to be powerful.A player wipe would make implementing a lot of these things more convenient, i.e. with the supply and demand idea for quest races, demons and angels would already be completely watered down.'Pursue' for PvP.  Since it is almost impossible to track someone down who command stacks and leaves the system at warp 9, have it so you can pursue them, like stalk, minus the stealth.  The effectiveness of the pursuit could depend on certain skills and stats.The idea I want implemented most!!!!!!!!!!  Attack combos!  Make it so, when attacking, if the target has high enough wisdom or something, your attacks become predictable.  You can't slash 10 times in a row because eventually the target has come to expect that attack.  So \"useless\" low level moves would become useful in combat.  Maybe a 'slash, slash, whirl, jab, slash, choke' would do more damage than a 'slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash'. Please please please consider this one.  It would make all the crappy moves useable, and combat a lot more fun.  An extremely tough monster may not even let you use two of the same moves in a row!  Think about it!Umm that's all I can think of for now.  Thanks.  =)Levi"
