__Letter "Hey Frog, I just wanted to tell you, since I can't reach you anywhere else except here, don't worry about working for me tomorrow night. I just thought that you might've wanted some hours, andI was willing to give it to you. But anyway - I haven't found anyone to cover for me, so I'll either ask someone else when I go in tonight or I'll just call in sick tomorrw night. But I just wanted to tell you thank you anyways for helping me out:) I know you're busy with a lot of things,and you probably don't need me asking me to work for me, so I'm sorry if I offended you. Talk to you later sometime.Froggie"
