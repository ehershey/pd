__Letter "Hey sorry, Leviathas and I would like to ally our guilds, Unholy & Ethereal. I think I will need to speak to whit on this, but in case you can do it quicker that would be nice. All Unholy members will need access to Ethereal's guild hall, and Ethereal guild items should auto for them as well too, and vice versa. We also need access to eachother's lines.It sounds a little tedious so if you don't have time for this, please note this to Whit for me. I'm more than happy to edit any code myself.Thanks,Jen"
