__Letter "What happened was a BUGWhen I chaoswaved, they should have attacked just me, but for some reason the drows all attacked necrite too.  He had enough charisma so that they wouldn't auto him, but for some reason when my spell hit them they did.Daos and I conducted tests and we concluded that it was a bug.If you wish to know more, just look over the log.Hopefully, that means you're not pissed at me...err.. I hope so at least.  But Necrite needs about 3-5 mill to get himself back up to speed?Look, I still take responsibility for this, but I feel better in knowing that I didn't kill him.My spell only did 50 damage to him and I just got in one round of melee on him. Had the spell not messed up and had everyone in the room attacked him I would have been able to peace as I didn't have the insane stats to do more then 100 per round of melee to himSo yay? I'm in the clear? Maybe?-Hermes the immortal??? Please?"
