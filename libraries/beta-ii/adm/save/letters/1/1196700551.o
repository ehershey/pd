__Letter "OK then. How about this     The issue is i can not always log into the builders port using gmud or zmud. I sometimes dont even have telnet cause im checkingfrom the library.Can you do this then?? If i log into the site as me, the option leading to builders would be there.This would keep it out of the publics sight and limit it onlyto the staff that can log into the staff. It's not NEEDED butwould make life easier on me thruout the week. This way i cankeep tabs on the newbie builders requests for help.What im saying is making it screen player from staff when welog onto the site. If were staff, the option would be there touse the java server for builders. The site already has the optionto let us log in.IronmanIt's not required. It is just a conveniance im looking for. I'dunderstand if ya said no."
