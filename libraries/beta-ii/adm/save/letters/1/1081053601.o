__Letter "Whether I ignore her or not she still makes mean comments to and about me. Not that I need this taken into consideration. And yes, I do have essential things to tell her on occasion. There have been times where she asks a question and I've answered it. I do not consider her or anyone else here a real enemy, and so I try not to put people on ignore too often unless I really don't want to see them speak. I have yet to ever say anything very mean to Sugarcandy. I've always been pretty polite to her, privatley or otherwise. Each time that she talks to me though, it's always one insult after the other. Today was the second time I ever acknowledged her \"meanness\". Most of the time I do ignore her. I know she's just trying to push my buttons which is why I don't let it go. I'm just hoping that she's gonna give it a break and that's all.-Kumi"
