__Letter "Maybe, just maybe I have studied you enough to have a pretty good idea what your stats and skills look like.  Arenaing doesn't really help you in any case.For instance, based on how easy it is for Rubicante to kill you vs how easy it is for him to kill me.  I'm going to claim that you have low MD and probably low hitpoints.  Since both of these are critical for your type of class I would argue that you are dumping all your points into faith and magic attack in order to get a more powerful holyfire.Argue with me all you want, I care not.Have a nice day."
