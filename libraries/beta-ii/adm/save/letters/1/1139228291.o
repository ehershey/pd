__Letter "Hey Baby, I just wanted to tell you good morning lol. You're probably at home asleep or atleast I hope so considering it's 4:16 there. It's 6:16 here, I'm running a little slow today but oh well, I'm not in any rush to get to that stupid school at all. I miss you tons and I wanted to let you know that you've been running through my mind all night (no dirty thoughts...well maybe 1 or 2 :P) But yeah. I hope you're having good dreams and I still hope you have a good day today, even if I get to talk to you or not *prays that he gets to talk to you though* I love you and I'm going to stop rambling now.Forever yours,Josh"
