__Letter "Hey, baby. Sorry if I've been bugging you lately. I didn't realize you had two jobs. Well, I'll leave you alone for now and I'll stop sending you mail every time something bad happens to me.  :)  Hope to see you soon.Get your rest. I know how much time having two jobs takes away from your life.Best Wishes,Savannah"
