__Letter "Firstly i would like to say i made a mistake in my post and i was agreeing with Eios' last 2 paragraphs. Mainly with these statements:Primal Darkness guilds are their own orriginal guilds. They're not ones out ofbooks or other movies so don't go saying to me \"We're doing this because thisis what guilds should be like\"... This is what Primal Darkness guilds are andshould remain. &&Sinceyou became a Immortal you've tried your hardest to change them to your likingand to tell the truth.. keep away from them.Now i don't mean to aggrevate you. I was just posting my opinion on the matter and personally i think i was much more conservative than anyone else.It was just the suggestion that to remove everything from guilds. Mind you this also effects our guild probably the least aswell. Combined with this statement:It's also a redesign of what guilds arement to be, which is a collection of like-minded individuals, rather then aclinque where everyone uses guild equipment to get buffer.--sorry for bad linewrapWhich drove me to agree with Eios' opinion thats all."
