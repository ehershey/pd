The room itself still      |        smells of fresh paint.  A brand new polished table sits in    |     [X]the middle of the room with paperwork on top of it.  A board  |     -  sits in the middle of the room where leaders may post about   |         topics that only other leaders can see. There is only one obvious exit: down.Guild leaders board < 0 Unread, 26 Posts > is here."
