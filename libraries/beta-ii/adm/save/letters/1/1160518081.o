__Letter "Nulvect,I was wondering if my IP is still set up to be used as alan IP. My friend and I tested it out and we could stilllog on with our Characters at the same time.The reason I am asking is because this weekend two of myfriends would like to play PD, and they are going to becoming around my house. I understand the lan rules eg, no sharing of money,items etcand I also think there is a no PK rule as well, which is finewith me.when I spoke to Stormbringer about getting set up, he saidthat my friend and I could still xp together in a group.This is the main thing we want to be able to do.If everything is still set up, I just wanted to give you a heads up about it any way.Thank you for your time,Kilrog."
