__Letter "Well, it is lovely to hear from you too, dear. You must tell me the direction you were going, we shall go there together, and yes we must take plenty of seals with us. I am glad you had one on you, or you might have been stranded, you must be careful with such things. You are still young Arial, I know you are adventurous, but you must be wary of the roads that lie ahead, there are still many creatures that can harm you. Train up so you can adventure with jyn and I.  Love,Empyrean"
