__Letter "The light in this turn of the cave is so overpowering that some creatures would need to cover their eyes.  An absence of regular stone and excess of white crystals create a blinding aura which is inescapable.  There are golden flakes littering every inch of the room, which adds to the visual discomfort.  Although there are no shadows in this room, an odd sense that there are lurkers hiding remains.The ceiling in this stretch of rock creeps down to the ground, barely presenting passage out.  Without second glance, this could be a dead end.  Rodents scurry between the opening, squeaking bath and forth.  The white crystals seem to be in a less concentrated state toward the opening.  Light invades the room through numerous holes in the slanting ceiling.This stretch of cave is significantly hotter than most other areas.  Holes cover the ceiling and walls, from which a sort of steam seems to escape.  Particles of gold dust flicker through the steam, causing large bursts of light in the steam when hitting the crystalline light.  Thousands of small insects can be seen in the steam, floating aimlessly through the air.A stretch of stalactite and stalagmite bound cave is spread out in a very dangerous fashion.  Jagged chunks of rock commonly fall to the ground from the stalactites, shattering around the room.  The stalagmites cause difficulty for traveling through, many paths leading to dead ends.  Dead rodents and bats litter the floor, victim to the falling rock."
