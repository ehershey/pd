__Letter "Hey sweet love. :) Classes are done for the summer! Just one morein the fall and I will have my degree. :) Interesting developmentsat work. It seems that they are trying to suspend as many peopleas possible in order to save money. I am not surprised becausethese are some cheap, petty so-and-so's. It's a shame they wannatake an easy job and make it hard. Anyway, I might try for a littlenap. Maybe I will get to see you late tonight or early tomorrow?I tingle with anticipation. >:) Ooooo, tingly.All my love,Your James"
