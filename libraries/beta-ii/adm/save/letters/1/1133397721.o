__Letter "Endy-You have many of the same concerns that I and a few Admin/Imms have. We are addressing problems with much more success now than we ever have. I assure you that your letter has been read, and that it has been heard. Thank YOU for writing so clearly what bothers you. This, above all - is what will help us to move forward. I know you've been around for awhile, and have seen patterns in the game that I as an immortal, dont always catch. Seeing the priorities you have given helps me to get a sense of where to start. I'll get right on it. A couple things will take time to work on - the balance issue, as you know - and certainly enforcing PG rating on the mud is always going to be a struggle. it is everywhere. But once a standard is set, we imms will have something to hang onto. Guilds are number one on our priority lists right now -so i can tell you that those problems will be seen to shortly. Custom items are a pet peeve of mine because they HAVE been abused so often in the recent past. I assure you that THAT problem, at least - is being taken care of... as we speak.I'll be in touch.~Azzy"
