__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Sugarcandy to Wiz Sat Nov 29 17:08:40 2003:-----Wiz,I was wondering if you could do me a favor and make a small item for me.  All I want is a simple black leather collar made, nothing fancy, five minutes coding at most.  There is a collar in the game but it neither autos or is the desired item really.  On the collar I am asking about I was hoping to have a small engraving done...%^BOLD%^MAGENTA%^@%^RESET%^GREEN%^}->--%^BOLD%^BLACK%^D%^RESET%^MAGENTA%^u%^BOLD%^BLACK%^e%^RESET%^MAGENTA%^r%^BOLD%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^GREEN%^--<-{%^BOLD%^MAGENTA%^@I would really appreciate it if you could make this happen, if not I do understand.. kinda :)  Anyways.. just send me a mail back either way.Sugar"
