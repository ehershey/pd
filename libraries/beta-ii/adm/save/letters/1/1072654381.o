__Letter "Hey, you remember those room/item/etc creators you made?  I really liked them.  There were a couple of things missing that would have really helped though.  Anyway, I think you should do them again, and if it's at all possible have it so they get sent right to your builders directory and stuff...  which would rock.  I have some suggestions if you do it."
