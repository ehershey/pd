__Letter "Other random balance.Heal can be spammed. Prator abuses that big time. Loki showed the bug to me.The balance on monster rushes is off. does way too much damage. i take 140 from royal guards  (33k) and i have high defense and 50 con/str/dex. dunno if player balance on rush is off but the mobs hit too hard with theirs."
