__Letter "The Wisdom Of A Prophet Is The Burden Of A Scholar.One of the greatest gifts the Gods ever gave to mankind was the ability to reason.  In this entity we have been given the power of knowledge and the desire to seek the truth.  To question this given knowledge is what makes people like Socrates a philosopher.  Within the dialogues of Plato lie both the books of Crito and Phaedo.  The death of Socrates discussed by his dearest and fellow friends is one of the most devastating tragedies that will forever pierce deeply through the heart of philosophy's history.In regards to the first portion of the two dialogue's within this great controversy, Socrates explains to Criton how there is no reasoning with the law, for it's complex structure is built to serve justice and the virtues of ethics to better the ways of the land. And this mighty hand of justice that services the country that which it wields is quite simply unreasonable in all attempted efforts.  This legacy is what leads to the second half of the death of Socrates and all it's essence that is bound by the strings attached to the laws of Athens.  As unyielding as these commands may seem, it is impossible to break the soul, however the body is not so fortunate in these harsh times that showed absolutely no mercy whatsoever.	It is almost impossible to keep a balance of neutrality in the world between the battles of good and evil.  In the words of Socrates \"I only wish the many could do the greatest mischief, so that they could also do the greatest good! That would be well indeed. As it is, they can do neither for they cannot make a man either wise or foolish they do things quite at random (Crito 43C-45E pg. 449).\"  This quote expresses how Socrates feels on the operational mechanisms of how society works, and reflects the purpose of having a centralized government to keep all the chaos that lingers at bay.  Even though Socrates at heart feels that he has done nothing wrong, his admiration and love for the city of Athens along with everything she has done for his own being he can't disobey her womb.  For Socrates is a child of this beautiful land as is everything else that resides within it.  Therefore, as an individual in her society and understands it is his duty as a citizen of Athens to uphold and respect the authority of his motherland.The conversation pursued by first making a point that it would be immoral and wrong to take one's life in the ways of suicide.  Socrates questions his friends and followers and turned heads when it came to this absurd act when he backed up with reasons why it is considered to be unlawful and this is where Cebes argued \"It is proper that wise men should object to die, and foolish men should be glad (Phaedo 61B-63A pg. 465).\"  Meaning, wise people would want to be governed by one who is even wise as an apprentice to his master.  Which would mean Socrates is a fool, for accepting death because of the fact he has battled life for all his existence in this forsaken land and has thus, given up.  Socrates argued how the civil duties not to his country, but to the gods themselves and how it would be punishable to take action on one's self without this acknowledgement.  This declares that the gods in the afterlife are by far the greatest master that could ever exist.Among all his friends, Crito most of all did not want to see his lifelong friend sentenced to death and tried to convince Socrates otherwise.  He used personal attacks through the powers of reasoning to persuade him into escaping his execution sentence via claiming Socrates was betraying himself, his wife & sons, how they did not represent his case properly in court by supporting him, and thus, now wish to set him free.  If a vital lesson to be learned derived from this it would be Socrates' belief that \"We must not respect all the opinions of men, but only some? And not the opinions of all men but only of some? (Crito 45D-47C pg. 451)\" In that, even though justice was served by the councilmen of the law may not have been morally correct, and many will not agree with the chosen path of so called righteousness.  The only word that counts is the divine decision of justice, otherwise there would be anarchy, and therefore Socrates felt \"Then we must not do wrong in return, or do evil to anyone in the world, however we may be retreated by them (Crito 49B-51A Pg. 454).\" This must happen in order for the result of staying true to not only his country, but himself. Thus, through cleansing his debt to society under the administration of the lords and the gods above he will be free of and no longer carry such heavy burdens on his soul and leaving a respectable reputation behind his footsteps instead of a dishonorable infidel always on the run.  Personally, the way I see it, Socrates was not drinking poison to reach his demise he was embracing the ambrosia of the gods itself and grasping the truth he so dearly dreamt of.	A true philosopher is one who is at a certain mindset that which he has shared a state of being with the reaper all his life, for he is already dead within.  Socrates touched a nerve that I once believed by his words when Socrates said \"The fact is, those who tackle philosophy aright are simply and solely practicing dying, practicing death, all the time, but nobody sees it (Phaedo 63B-65A pg. 466-467).\"  If this is the way of a philosopher to not partake embracement in any of life's joyful occasions then he is choosing a path of nothingness in a trade for fulfilling a inner emptiness that is a slave to its' infinite hunger in the quest for truth and wisdom.  To not eat a piece of pecan pie is staying true to one's soul by keeping pleasures afar that would otherwise deceive it simply because the body is filled with impurity.  Therefore I can't help but agree  with Simmias in regards to Socrates' question \"Do you think such a man's concern is not for the body, but as far as he can he stands aloof from that and turns towards the soul? (Phaedo 63B-65A pg 467.)\"The soul is a free spirit in, and is defined as the activity in humans, established by the abilities of thought process, ones' actions, emotion, as well as morals. It is often perceived to be an immaterial or ethereal entity.  This soul or gift of nature that resides within mankind is considered not only immortal, but also separable from the body when death occurs.  However, \"when does the soul get hold of the truth? For whenever the soul tries to examine anything in company with the body, it is plain that it is deceived by it.\" - Socrates (Phaedo 65A-67A pg. 466). With this said, one can conclude it is only the general natural way of thinking as a philosopher and any other would be a philosoma which would be anyone that deceives the true being of a philosopher in that he would rather choose the spoils of war at one's self by rejoicing in the good (material) things in life that satisfy the greed of the body.  It is through the study philosophy that one can overcome the fear of death.  As a man of such knowledge, a scholar of his own kind and a father to many of his followers, he has no reason to fear for he has already lived with the burden as a student, and has become a teacher in the arts of wisdom.  To his belief, he will be purified of his wrongful ways, and thus live among the free kindred spirits. \"Then fear, and fearing, makes all men brave, except philosophers.  Yet it is unreasonable to become brave by fear and cowardice! (Phaedo 67A-68E pg. 471)\"  Since intemperance is ruled by pleasures as many say, and it takes a lot out of someone to resist these temptations - I believe the saying \"ignorance is bliss\" plays a minor part in this and when dealing with salvation and the freedom through purity this common phrase becomes a false statement.  If one is blind to see the ways of philosophy and indulge in the corruption of the body throughout their entire life they have a much bigger price tag on their soul when it comes to paying up when the bell tolls. In Ancient Greek mythology it was believed that a chamber of souls was where they were kept upon after death.  This lair resided under the rule of the god of the underworld known as Hades.  The scholars argued with much reason and came up with examples of existing life styles from being awake and going to sleep compared to being alive and into death.  Eventually a conclusion was drawn and a life cycle that had the rotation \"if there is coming to life again, this coming to life would be a being born from the dead into the living (Phaedo 71A-72C pg. 475).\" And thus, since this cycle of a soul going in and out of a bodily state is being reborn and has certain memory traits of it's previous life. 	When a soul is transferred to and from a bodily state, somewhere throughout the scenario a process known as recollection takes place.  If and when a person is reminded of something, he must first have known that thing at one point in time or another.  Recollection itself is knowledge that comes about in a way that when a person upon seeing one thing not only becomes conscious of it, but also of something else which is a different object of knowledge.  We also can conclude that there are such things as absolute equality, in one form or another.  This knowledge is gained from one of these forms from seeing particular things that are quite different from these forms but share the same absolute qualities.  This knowledge is knowledge by recollection.  In order for this to be true, we must have had previous knowledge of these qualities before the first time we were happened to be reminded of them by our ways of perception.  It is therefore quite impossible for anyone of us to have gained this original knowledge of these traits in any other possible way than through recollection that is triggered by the senses of the body.  It is clear that before we are able to begin using our senses, we must have somewhere acquired this knowledge.  And thus, we begin to see and hear at birth and acknowledge these characteristics before birth which brings truth to Socrates' claim that our souls have prior existence before the process of birth. (Phaedo 71A-75C pg.473-483).  		The nature of the soul itself is rather quite simple, and that is part of the reason why it all adds up.  It can't be composed of different parts and that is why it can't be indivisible.  If something is filled with such simplicity it can't be destroyed because decomposition insists parts will be broken naturally and if it has no parts that can not occur.  What it boils down to is the fact that no individual's soul has more or less then one another.  Everything that occurs during life and death comes from the opposite which concludes life comes from death and vice versa, death from life as well.  If everything died, and the dead remained that way, everything in time would no longer be alive.  Without this eternally running cycle, there would be nothing.  The essential path of nature is life, and life alone can not go on without the soul, which leads to the point that the soul itself is essential to living and can not die.  Simmias objected Socrates in this that the soul may be compared to harmony and that the body is like music to the lute instrument.  Cebes also commented how even if the soul can exist without a body, there is no proof the soul can survive the deceasing process.  Both of these contradict the fact that the Soul is immortal in itself, and therefore, because of the recollection process, the concept of life and death, as well as the overall essential way of life were proven by Socrates that there's no other way. (Phaedo 83B-100A pg. 489-503).This series of questioning the truth forever seeks the desire to piece the puzzle of the unknowns together from bits and pieces.  To reach inner peace, one must compose this ensemble of thoughts - and that is the secret behind becoming a true philosopher.  Furthermore, I feel he is giving up on philosophy and neglecting his study itself because if he chose death to move on into a better place, that means he's pursuing pleasure in ending the life of the body to reveal the mask behind the face of that the soul bears, rather then continuing the eternal search for wisdom by accepting death.  Now, if what he told his colleagues is what he really believes to be true, he either does not believe his own words, or is hiding something that he may after all be a borderline philosoma, or simply just doesn't realize it.  I think he is just looking for a reason to establish a relationship with his heart that he is content with dying.  As I reached the end of the assigned readings from the dialogue, I only came to realize how wrong I was with my assumption, and that I too hope to be content as he was when it is my time to go.CitationI)	Plato.
