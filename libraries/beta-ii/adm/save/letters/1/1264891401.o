__Letter "Hi James :I'm quite well actually, I was hoping to run into you some time on the mud,but you seem to be idle or I just miss you.  I had some great news that I wanted to share - I shared it with Yangalready.  Yep, you might guess it - I'm going to have a baby - we'reso excited.  We both really wanted one and I'll be 32 in June, so we wanted to start our family soon.  I'm due beginning of September, so have a way to go.  Sean is spoiling merotten, and he's so excited about it.  We were going to England for a fewmonths for part of his training, but now it's not a good idea.  He'll go thereand then come home, but his training will only be 6 weeks and then wewere going to just travel around, but he'll come home instead.Apparently, we can find out what the baby will be in March, even thoughSean doesn't care either way.  I know my Dad would have loved anothergranddaughter, because my brothers seem to produce more boys.  heheanyway, I hope to catch you on here some time.  Miss talking to you,maybe see you on caption some time.  *hugs*Rayna :)"
