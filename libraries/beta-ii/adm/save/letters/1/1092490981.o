__Letter "I don't want to be the quest thing and I won't share the answer or anything, but if my calculations are correct 1X2^64 is the wrong equation. The total sum of gold would be 63111, That is if you start in 1 cornor and the 2 squares touching it is doubled, then the 3 squares touching that is doubled. Let me know if I'm wrong, cause then I would have to debug my program.Thanks Raiku, the avid coder guy"
