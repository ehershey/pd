__Letter "Heres what im thinking about adding to guilds...Guilds will have alignment with other guilds.  The more you pk people from another guild, the more your guild and the other guild goes into War status.   Once 2 guilds go into war status, they may pk freely of eachother.  This status will reset every reboot, and, im thinking of some type of counting system where if 2 guilds are in war, once so many pks are achieved, it goes back to nuetral.  Like a guild won the war.Whit"
