__Letter "Early in the morning, while you were meditating, I went to take our newest member, to the coliseum to test her weaknesses, and to have a bit fun. Two townspeople interrupted our training, taking both of us down.  It was quiet disappointing that they had to ruin the time for dear Arial.  Although, earlier in the day I went hunting had quiet a good time, also showed Arial what a Necromancer can do on their travels. I made a pet for her, she had a splendid time, trying to figure out  where the pets commands were coming from. After the interruption from the towns people, I just decided to allow exploring this beautiful town of Tirun, to get my mind off things, and relax for today. I came across some homes, that are quiet massive, it is a shame no one lives at them anymore, I could tell they were quiet beautiful in their day.  I can tell from your letter, love that your spirits are quite higher than yesterday. You are not allowing your fall to get to you, you are my strong King, I adore and Love you very much. I know you can stick it through the days. Your Love, Empyrean ~^~{@"
