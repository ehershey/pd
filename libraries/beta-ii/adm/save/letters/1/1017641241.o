__Letter "Well, sorry I've missed you for the most part...  things have been fairly busy with my friends from michigan coming over and all.  I've been thinking about you a bit, too..  I hope I havent worried you too much.  I'm quite alright.  I just hope you're doing well, or at least better.  If you want to talk or anything, let me know and I'll make sure to be online.  *hugs*"
