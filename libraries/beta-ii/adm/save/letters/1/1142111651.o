__Letter "Ok, here's what I've figured out...This doesn't deal with damage or anything, since if I remember correctly, you just want limbs to be ripped off.object target = <whatever the target is>;//get a random limb; best way is 'string limb = target->query_limbs()[sizeof(target->query_limbs())];//Err, sorry, meant this:string limb = target->query_limbs()[random(sizeof(target->query_limbs()))];//Ok, now to remove it...// First, see if it's fatalif( target->query_reference(limb) == \"FATAL\"; // quotes are important, it's a string{  target->die();}// Now, if it has something attached to it...if( size(target->query_reference(limb)) > 0 ){  target->remove_limb(target->query_reference(limb));}// and last but not least, remove the actual limbtarget->remove_limb(limb);////////////////////////////////////////Note that this isn't perfect, as the attached limb *could* also have an attached limb, and so forth (though I'm not aware of any like that). I leave it as an exercise for you to figure out how to delve deeper if needed, and keep track of which limbs need to be removed. I'll give a hint: You'll need a string array, and most likely a while loop."
