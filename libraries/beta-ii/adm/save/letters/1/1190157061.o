__Letter "Ok, Res. Here's the deal. Noxus and Diamond (Zack's alt) have words on the newbie line. Noxus says how orig. the name is, etc. They fuss a bitand then Diamond switches on to Zack. Noxus says on newbie lol I knew it wasa douche. Zack then says u disrespect me on a public line, yer out theguild. Take that, basically. Noxus gets mad, threatens darksoul, etc.Zack takes it as proof that Noxus never meant the guild any good.I tell Zack maybe he overreacted. He flips out cuz I'm obviouslytaking Noxus' side, re-adds him and leaves the guild without so muchas a goodbye. Also, mails you that letter which came before mine.Fact: Noxus = Arma. If you have a prob that I added him, I will takewhatever punishment you deem fit.Fact: Zack responded to comments that were made relating to his alt.This crap is multiplay and we should be above that.Fact: Zack left the guild at the drop of a hat. And for the pettiestof reasons. Because I didnt 100% agree with his actions.Fact: Noxus acts like a douche sometimes. But I didnt think this guildof ours was always predicated on good behavior.So, I reinstated Zack and allowed his decision to stand. Booted Noxus.And am mailing you this marathon literature so you can decide how youwant this to go down. If you did say before that Arma n co were out for good,my apologies for allowing him in.Talk to yaEsco"
