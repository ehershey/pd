__Letter "Stormy,Here is a sample of a possible role-playing premise for the vampire character.  I'm commited to making this a quality job if you accept the proposal.Before there was light, the universe was nearly a black void, ruled over by an entity known as The Primal Darkness.  Life as we know it did not exist.  When light came, The Primal Darkness was utterly subverted and caged between the stars.  Over billions of years of captivity, it's ‘flesh' was rent by the daily cycles of the worlds.  It's body, infinite and ever-replenishing, suffered agony that cannot ever be described accurately.  Driven insane, it's consciousness gradually faded to what was perceived to be a dismal nothing, save for whispers that the gods hear now and then, but ignore.But The Primal Darkness' mind had not diminished.  It's maternal nature changed.  It knew love for the beauty of miraculous life, but it also knew hate for the light, and so in the darkness underground, it took part in purposeful Creation for the first time.  Death rather than birth was given to a creature of the night, a being not alive, but like the living, proof that beauty and things of worth could exist without the light.  The Primal Darkness was in error.  It's Creation awoke, but craved the blood of the living, and so was indirectly dependent on the light.  ‘Azoba', the gods called him in their language, ‘harbinger of the Primal Darkness'.  They perceived him as a ghost given form, and feared him for the authority that he represented, The Primal Darkness which might once again dominate the universe and end Creation.Azoba is a blank slate, knowing nothing about the world.  He has an instinctual affinity for dark places, and a hatred for and weakness to sunlight.  He worships the darkness as being greater than divine, and also worships life, but often consumes in order to satisfy his impulses.  Naively, he is on a hopeless quest to convince the gods to help him ‘put out the stars' and use their personal powers to preserve life.Hope you liked it,Levi"
