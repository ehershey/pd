__Letter "Hey Beautiful, how are you doing this morning? Hopefully, you're doing well and having a good dream right now. It's 4:18 your time and 6:18 my time and I was coming on before I got my shower to see if you had left any mail and I noticed you did. *smiles* I love the fact you think about me a lot and I'm sorry if I'm distracting :( *also blushes* Oh, and yeah I just wanted you to know that I was kidding about calling Carina, I really don't think I'd like her as a person in real life..she kinda seems...slutty if you know what I mean, but don't tell her I said that, she'll whoop my ass on here :P. But I also came on to say that I'm kinda running a little late today so I won't be able to send you a very long message. Just know that I love you and that I think of you constantly (no dirty thoughts!!! Well....maybe a few :P). You are the sweetest person I think I've ever met and I'm so glad that you decided to go out with me. I love you, Simran *hugs and kisses* Have a good day today, Beautiful.Always and Forever yours,Josh"
