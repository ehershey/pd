__Letter "Hi stormy, im sure you may remember me a little at least i've played the mud for quite a while although i've gotten married and had a kid so i havent played in about a year, one of my characters agent, was arrested..im not too sure entirely why i may have done something  but i do know that cenn hacked all of my accounts which i do accept responsibilty for because i should have changfed my passwords a long time ago, btw im on telnet sorry about the sloppinessanyways i was hoping maybe agent could be considered for being un-arrested, i'd like to get back into playin gpd again and i still will play even if i dont gete him back, he just has very sentimental value to me as far as the game goes and i did cide (once again my fault :P) a lot of my characters and he's one of the few i have leftalso i have a much older character Mazrim who was arrested a long time ago and im not sure why,  (mazrim) incase i spelled it wrong, again, telnet sorrywell ill wrap it up, i promise i'll play by the rules and i wont ruin anyones fun, i would just love to have my old chars back theyve been arrested for years hehe :)"
