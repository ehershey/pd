__Letter "Your Items:As stated in the help guild addons, you are only allowed one item that has anything special to it; therefore, all three of your items need to be rethought of and decided about which one you want to have special and which ones you can live without.  As far as the room goes, no rooms will be allowed to have autoload through a reboot, as the items placed in the room as just that, placed, not incoded into the room; and no, there is no way around that.So rethink about your ideas and get back to me when you can."
