__Letter "Comments that i didn't have the time to put in my email:wedding.jpg: a picture of me at my brother's wedding. change out the dress for jeans and a t-shirt and that is how i usually look from day to day. homecoming.jpg: a picture of me at homecoming. i sent you this one because i love the look on my face. i've got this grin like i'm about to do something naughty, or just did something naughty and got away with it, or know something that nobody else knows. heheh. gotta love that evil grin. :) Anyway, that was what i didn't put in the e-mail because i didn't have time to write it. so there ya go. :) Heather"
