__Letter "I have created an updated resurrect that you could consider./wizards/amarael/spells/_rez.cHopefully it can go in since it doesn't really have anything to do with elements?I have made it so that once you max skills for lvl65 you can resurrect characters who are of a quest race, if you have the appropriate corpse. Only if they are already that quest race.Max skills at level80 mean that you don't actually need a corpse to resurrect.ever 3rd of the way for max skills between lvl50 and lvl100 you can add an extra level to a character. Only if it is certain they have lost a level. It only gives back as many levels as they may have lost. at lvl67 near max skills you can add 1 lvl, lvl84 near max skills you can recover up to two. At 100 max skills you can recover up to all three lvls lost.Also, race change at 50max skills is the same as it is now. At 100max skills it is a perfect change, no loss of stats. The change is gradual as your skills improve. You never regain lost levels, however.I set it to give back the automatic exp cut when you die. Usually you lose 1/3rd of your exp when you die, that is replaced. Also, it gives you bonus exp equal to ( ( ( your level cubed ) / 20 ) * cleric's skills ).So a 100 max skills cleric gives a lvl1 his saved exp as well as an extra 900. a lvl50 gets 11.25 mil. This is to recover loss of skills and stats. *NOTE* this is from a level ONE-HUNDRED cleric with MAX FAITH MAX BELIEF MAX HEALING. Also it NEVER gets better than this. If you have max skills for your level, it's gonna cost alot to get them back.I have made it this good because: a) It is restricted to one class.b) It is an elite movec) It requires 3 skills to be maxed each level. At 83 this totals about 90Mxp/lvl.d) The examples I have you are for a lvl100 with max skills, basically a perfect resurrect.   At 50 it is less than half as good.e) Death really hits hard and the only other options for resurrect don't give anything back.   So if a player goes to this much effort as a cleric, then isn't it worth it?   The most powerful clerics won't just rez willynilly, they will charge for such a good rez.   I am pretty sure it will balance out like that, with such a good spell they won't just do   it any time.That is all I can think of for the moment. I can discuss later."
