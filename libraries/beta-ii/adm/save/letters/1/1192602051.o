__Letter "Ok I quit out and relogged in and I was hardcore bugged couldn't use any commands and it kept telling me the color like i'd walk into a room and it would say %_^BLUE%_^ but thats all i could do is walk around. Then it made me quit out and i waited a few minutes and relogged and almost my whole inventory was lost... I'm pretty sure this was because of the belt of candles. I put a few wax in it for the first time and then this happened. I'd be so happy if you would please, please give me back my stuff... i'll send you a mail of what i have right now and what I had before."
