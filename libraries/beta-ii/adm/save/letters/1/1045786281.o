__Letter "Hey. I was wondering if I could be the one to be set in charge of balance? I really do know the mud from a playing point of view the best of all the Imms. Plus its easier if i can just do my balance without others whinning at me and then i send the balance to you for your aproval. That way if you dont like it then just toss it, but if you do like it i can garuntee that it will be balanced out and i wont have to put up with everyone wanting an input on it.Hermes seems really good at coding and would be better suited to that. In the end he is very set on making certain things overpowered (holyfire and bladedance and rage for example). Things will go much quicker if i can take care of ability/spell balance while he does larger changes to things like making areas or that combat system idea of his.Lemme know if this is alright, and i'll hopefully have you the rest of the area attack code within a few days as well.Thx,-- Rubicante"
