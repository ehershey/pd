__Letter "I'm trying to establish the procedure that i will be instructingthe builders to follow for certain tasks. I need you opinion onone item thu right now so i know how to word the tutorial.The topic is the use of applies, using (: :) in lfuns, andthe use of add_action().I feel that they should follow the flow i have them listed inabove. Since the driver and/or mudlib look for the applies ontheir own, it seems logical that would be the first method ofgetting their objects to do what they wish them to do. The samegoes for using function pointers in the lfuns. I do not carefor the add_action() method of calling a function except as alast resort due to the fact that any pre-existant command withthe same name as the verb used in add_action will be maskedunless the pre-existant command has the nomask variable type onit.Please write back to me when you can about this. I would alsolike to hear of any other stages you would like them to followbesides these three. Im just trying to save us time by makingthe areas as coherant and clean as possible code-wise so we don'thave to bother debugging them after them come into the Game-site.Even if/when i were to imm here, that would be my main focusas it is something i enjoy doing. Playing the role of \"code-cop\"and making sure their objects work with the minimial amountof resources. The other issue i would watch for is that they donot interfere with other objects in the game. Final task wouldbe to help them set up quests , and the security screen aroundthem so that it wouldn't matter if someone gained quest info :PIronman"
