__Letter "I wasn't upset or anything, I just thought you knew something I didn't that's all, so I asked ven what was up.  You know how sometimes people ask questions for the intrest of someone else, and I thought that is what you were doing in ven favor, just how the questions were worded.  I don't mind answering questions, next time I won't jump to conclusions.  I like talking to you also.The reason why I haven't been on the last couple of days was because Friday I had to buy my mom and sister thier birthday presants, and had to wait over an hour to have them made.  Saturday I worked 8 hours, and then I met up with noa, wiz, and some others to celebrate wiz's 21st b-day, and didn't get home till late.  I wasn't avoiding you :)  Trust me, I would let you know if you were bothering me :)"
