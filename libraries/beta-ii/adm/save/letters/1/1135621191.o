__Letter "On Friday, October 28th, 2005 Tia was arrested for 60 days.I was just wondering if it was an auto-unarrest,Or if you had to do it manually.I Was hoping since my unarrest would of been Dec.28thand it was so close to christmas i'd be unarrested earlyIn light of the holidays,But no such luck, lol.Anyway, I look forward to playing again,And I was just reminding you incase you forgot.Or incase I was mistaken and it wasn't for 60 days.Thanks for your time."
