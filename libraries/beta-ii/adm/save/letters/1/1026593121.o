__Letter "Hey sup storm, I'm leavin monday and I don't think I'll be able to check in when I'm in Ecuador.  I'll be able to check email though.  So if my names log on, it most likely isn't me, but someone who hacked my char.  Ones I'd be worried about are soulfly, scarface, and ancalagon.  Anyway, I'll be back in two months, hope things get better for you before then.  Soulfly"
