__Letter "I forgot to tell you when we were talking the other day.I have a special project on builders that i have been tinkeringwith. I wanted to get your help cleaning it up cause Stormbringersaid he was very interested in it once it's complete.================================================================                       OVERVIEWThe whole idea of this project is to make senses available on ALLobjects and not just sounds/smells on rooms. Once the idea isfully developed, we will be able to store all five senses on anyobject we wish.================================================================                        FILESIll show them to you when were on together again."
