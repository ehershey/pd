__Letter "I'm getting all these cool ideas of how to patch up some things in the mud to make them better. Mostly just items and stuff, such as making it so that when you go to break a wax it does  if(present(str, this_player()) == this_object());, rather than if(str == loc_name);That could also go for stones/oils, which would be very nifty for stones since you might like to <rub stone [1/2/3]>. For things like sapphire rings you can [rub ring x], rather than cycling the rings through your inventory or something.Getting Corinthor in would be nifty too, as well as my guild update. Bringing in a Rhon deed, fixing up the Rhon quest so that the tene room is a hidden exit, and another little bug in it.Being able to do spells and abils would be nifty as, because while stormy has done alot of work on them, I have noticed that alot of abilities are still using wierd code for damage that is jsut far, far below any spells. Some spells don't even check for level or class, or if they do they do it  in the wrong order. So that if I am a level1 fighter it says \"You cannot soulburn at such a low level.\" (or whatever the failure message is). Cure uses tell_object(), so if you put tellblock on then you don't see your cure message.I mean, I really have the time for this, I am pretty sure I have the necessary experience to be able to do it, and after losing such a buff player, I just don't care who is better than who anymore, all classes can just be what they should be and everyone can else can shut the hell up.I messaged you because Stormy hasn't been on at all for 2 weeks :|'Tis all."
