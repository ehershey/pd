__Letter "I know we don't really know each other, but it seems that my making thischaracter again has caused some problems.  First and foremost, I wouldlike you to know that I am not here because of Josh.  I am only herebecause I enjoy the game and the people.  I also come on because Iam interested in James and want to be with him.  I also have other characters here.  If you feel that me being on asRayna is hurtful to you and Josh, let me know.  I will suicide Raynaand you won't have to worry.  But, I want to assure you that I haveno desire to hurt you and Josh or be anything other than a friend tothe two of you.  Thank you for listening.Rayna"
