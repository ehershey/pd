__Letter "Let me start by saying this will probably be hard,and it's for a quest/deed so I'd have to ask younot to share it with anyone else.  Well, yourmission, should you choose to accept it:An item called \"The Star of Insanity\" basicallynamed this because it will drive anyone who triesto solve it insane before they figure it out.When you look at it, it will tell you that you can \"enter window\" and try the trials of the insanitystar.Once you get into the star, there are six rooms youcan go to.  They are all connected so that to walkfrom one point to the other, you have to follow theshape of a star. (i.e, to get to another point, youhave to go through the middle.)Now, at each point, there is a colour wheel thatcontains the colours (blue, red, green, violet, yellow,black and white.  I know this is an incomplete colourwheel but I'm trying to stay within mud colours.)You must turn each of the wheels to match the picturebelow, and when each point is set on the right colour,go to the middle and try to activate the star at somekind of pannel or something.  Anyway, when you hit thecombination below, an angel floats down from nowhereand has a say, where I'll put in a questial message.        	  o(Red)     o(Violet) o(Blue)          o(activate after colours are in right order)     o(Yellow) o(Green)Well, thanks for taking the time to read this.  I really appreciate it.Leviathas"
