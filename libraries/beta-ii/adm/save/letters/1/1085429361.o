__Letter "Ok, ok his past is very shady, most people know almost nothing about him as a raknid...he's known mainly as a monk.his story is that when he was a child, his father a monk; he was raised as a monk as well and his abilities were very strong as a very young age. one day he claimed that his parents were demons and he brutally murdered them in the name of god...turned out they were demons and he ascended to the heavens to become an angel and a soldier of god.. now after slyaing for so long, he's gone a little insane and just hunts down anyone he can sense sin in and kills them in the name of god...when not killing he has a very calm and soothing demeanor his eyes turn blood red when he goes to kill someoneummthat's probably way more than ya needed but cheers, and thanks hehe"
