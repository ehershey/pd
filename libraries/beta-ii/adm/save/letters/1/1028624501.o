__Letter "If you haven't already heard I have remorted.I did so because it was my wish to roleplay a fallen archangel. I wanted to be an assasin, and I soon discovered that I can't. Now I had a discussion with daos and detach about it. Daos thinks I shouldn't be able to because it's not RPing correctly, I don't see how this works because that is exactly what I want to do. RP a fallen angel. Also being a rouge doesn't neccesarly mean being evil. Assasins think of their work purely as a job, to them it isn't evil it's just money. They aren't exactly saintly but by no means evil.Detach agreed with me to some extent but he saw why it is the way it is as I do I guess but IT's not as if I have just gone archangel and went and picked a evil race. I played a cleric and by and large was saintly about it. And now for my own reasons chose to fall from grace and become something less righteous. It ties in with the chracter I'm trying to play quite well don't you think.I don't expect to get my way and I'm not trying to tell you how to do anything. IT's just that I was getting very disheartened at the way my muding experience was heading and I was getting very bored. Then I got my idea and I was so excited by it I levelled strait to 50 and remorted instantly. However now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have lost a level 50 archangel cleric and I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do. I really don't want to be a cleric again and I was really excited about the thought of being something a million people weren't going to do strait after me. Sorry for the breaying and neighing there but I really really wanted to do this. Oh well. Let me know what you think.Thanks Halo - The confused angel"
