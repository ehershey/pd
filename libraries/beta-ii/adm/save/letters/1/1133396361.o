__Letter "On behalf of myself i write this to you. This is a large letter describing all of my concerns of the mud currently. From big to small i will attempt to cover everything in my own personal opnion. Please take this whole thing as such. Not what i demand or require of the mud, but simply my thoughts and feelings.First off, I feel that some immortals play favorties with others. Some favor one person while leaving the others out in the cold. For the sake of this writing i am going to leave out all rumors and believed to be truths about who favors who. But it strongly feels that favoriteism is running rampant for some in the immortal department, Thus unbalanceing and potentially ruining everyeones experience.One way this favoriteism is displayed is that while some people have been waiting months, even years to get guild updates done, or even having a new guild put in while other people simply can ask and have a brand new guild in the mud within weeks if no sooner of asking. In all fairness, shouldnt the people waiting be priortized before the most recent asking?Another way Favoriteism is displayed is how some people have large amount of gifts from the gods, and when other people ask for such gifts they are often told to go away or its not allowed. And to my knowledge any item that is custom can not have mud-wide displays, such as some do.The biggest display of favoriteism is when some people can get away with commiting rule breakeing offenses, regardless of the size of the offense. While other people will be punished to the fullest extent the first minor offense.Another problem i have come across is guilds themselves. With the rules as they are, one person can induct a large amount of members into their guild and have one killed, and be completely safe. I find that unfair because that keeps people from being pked and pking, an element to the game. Perhaps a limit to how many people can be inducted to your guild to keep it more secluded and guild like, rather than half the mud joining a single guild.Another problem with guilds is the items/portals/ect that they have. Either guilds should be allowed set things or nothing at all, this is a pressing issue that has beeing going on for a very long time and seemingly has been pushed aside for other reasons. I feel this is a problem that needs to be taken care of once and for all.This is less prevelant(sp?) nowdays, but is still a problem none-the-less. People complaining about how one class/subclass is overpowered/underpowered and whatnot, this is possibly the hardest thing to resolve, because the only true way i can see to fix it is to completly revamp each class/subclass. I think the people's biggest problem is that they feel they all should be the best pkers/expers/helpers and have it all. That should not be the case. Each class/subclass should be slightly unique so that one may be good for pking but not great for exping and assisting others. While another class can be great in asstance and useless in pk and slow in exp.Drinking/sexual references/drug usage and all other forms of non-PG rated things are almost completly ignored and have been for the longest time, Myself once was a big abuser of talking about non-PG rated issues on the public lines, However, i feel that its time that we all knock it off and keep it clean or to tells/guild chat.For the moment, this is all i can put into words, this may be alot, or nothing at all depending on how you precieve it. But as i think of more i will be happy to continue mudmailing you my thoughts and feelings on situations. Thank you for your time and i'd be more than happy to sit down and talk about issues and would greatly appriciated it if i heard back from you.Thank you again,Endy."
