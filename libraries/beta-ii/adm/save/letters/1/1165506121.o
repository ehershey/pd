__Letter "alright i have a little situation here, warrick pk'd monroe today in lodos, making warrick outlaw, so i went and killed him for it, and now i'm outlaw. i know it seems like i'm trying to worm my way out of certain death, and i'll be honest, i dont wanna die for killing an outlaw. i was wondering if it would be possible for outlaws to be free kills, it would only make sense. im a little worked up about the situation, and warrick is sayin im harassing him, but just keep in mind, he said he was going to just kill people before he quits playin so that is scummy,and i dont think i should be punished as the murder should be justified."
