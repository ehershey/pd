__Letter "all the eq i posted in on the board autoloaded for me some time ago.  also, i had had it with me for several reboots.  The reason i posted it on the board was because of whit's post to say what it was.  I listed eq that i had already recovered because i figured it would be used to track down the bug that caused it....the darkmail is the only piece of eq i can't recover by myself because of where it is located and requires a rogue to open the door."
