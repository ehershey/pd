__Letter "This is the post I feel like putting up; I'm putting up a much more santized version in a few seconds.I have a chip on my shoulder?When asked, a long time ago, my opinion on a few people to become Imms... I had to abstain because I didn't know anyone well enough to comment on them; good OR bad.Power trip? That's a very common (and generally baseless) claim made about people in positions of power. The only reason I was even looking into these claims is because no one else seemed to be. I don't care to be looking at logs to see if people are cheating, I'm here to code. That's it.As for adding to the mud; I may not be adding areas to explore, but that doesn't mean I'm not adding. I have a lot of projects (a few of them are areas) that I've had to put on the back burner because, quite frankly, I've spent more time recently being the \"police\" than coding.The most recent addition I've made is a change to how ointments are handled behind the scenes, allowing coders (or Imms) to easily make customized ones, with great flexibility on the messages. Is it fun and exciting to explore? No. Does it help the mud overall? I think so.Want to hear some of my projects that are sitting on the back burner, but I can't get time to do them because I'm busy \"policing\" all the time?Crafting. Weapons, armour, repairing, building upgrades for ships (or even entire ships!), cooking, potionmaking, and so forth.Is that a fun and exciting area to explore? No. Would it be a fun addition to the mud? You bet!There's an update to the auction system I've wanted to do for a while now. That's had to wait.There's an update to songs that I've wanted to do for a while now, and was actually going to do this week, but Real Life (TM) got in the way of that one, and with Dab not doing classes anymore, it's no longer as high a priority, so that'll probably have to wait.I have a few ideas for fun new commands; those have had to wait.I'm still not done tweaking the xp system, but that's been put on hold while I've been busy \"policing.\"I have plans for an entire continent to add (though this would be amongst the last of my projects). I know what shape it's going to be, I have a theme for it, I have a political system worked out for it, I have several deeds thought out, got a few sketchy ideas for quests, have lots of fun coding ideas to make the area seem more alive and less static... but again, I've had to wait.I'm guessing Vyce only coded, because having to deal with complaints every single day is not fun. That's why the people at the Wal-Mart customer service counter are always grouchy (I know, I was one of them).Anyway, since some have made it quite obvious that a mud is more fun if people are allowed to run around doing whatever they please - and if any one makes any attempt to stop it, they'll be bashed - I give up on the \"policing.\" Someone else can do it, and I'll do what's fun for me, and what I was here to do: code.Let's see if it will become a great mud, as some claim it no longer is, when no one is enforcing rules at all.Oh, yeah, I almost forgot: Those guild posts? Everything in them was purely Vyce, and had little to do with the guild itself. Now, you'd have reason to complain if I posted #34 (which is one I looked at, but decided against, because of its sensitive nature). I took care to delete anything that I thought would have been sensitive in the ones I did use, not only for the other guild involved, but Vyce's as well."
