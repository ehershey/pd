__Letter "Hey love, my class was cancelled! This means more time for sleepor maybe even talking to you. :) I am at my sister's office rightnow and waiting for her to finish up some calls to students. I willprobably be home around 5pm your time. So, if you wanna talk, mightbe a good time. Might nap...we'll see. :DIt is my fervent intent to build you up whenever I can. You are avery special lady and I fully recognize that and have trouble seeinghow anyone cannot. :) I will hope to see you later. If not beforework, I intend to take lunch around 10:30pm your time.Take care, love,James"
