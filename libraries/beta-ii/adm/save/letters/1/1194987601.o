__Letter "I have designed a new senses system and created a mock versionof the mudlib on builders. I showed the system to Stormbringerand hes interested in using it. Would you be willing to takesome time and give the system a once over ?? The followinglocations is where you can find the files;     1) /std/obj/iron_sense.c         This is where the storage functions are located for         the system. It gets inherited into the OBJECT inherit.     2) /std/IRON_OBJ_CHAIN        This is the mock version of the mudlib. This version        inherits the file named above into it's version of        OBJECT. Ofcourse, I had to recreate the entire chain        of inheritance so that i didn't have to alter the        existant mudlib for testing purposes. Entire chain        is in this directory.     3) /cmds/iron_senses        This directory contains the actual commands for using        the information stored inside the objects from #1.===============================================================I feel this kind of attention to detail will be a major drawboth to builders and players. Please come look it over whenyou can and critique it for me.Ironman"
