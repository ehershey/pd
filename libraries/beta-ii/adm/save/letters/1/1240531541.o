__Letter "James, please tell Yang I'm sorry and that online stuff gets messed up.Maybe I took what he said the wrong way, but that's the problem withonline conversations and I liked both of you.I did value the talks we had on yahoo chat and got to know you.I know this is just a game on here, but sometimes it gets personallyinvolved.  I doubt I'll return as Adila since Endy's not around.Take care, loveRayna"
