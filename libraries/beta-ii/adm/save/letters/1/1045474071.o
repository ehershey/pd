__Letter "Necrite wanted to show me how weak chaoswave was.  So the plan was for me to test it on some rough monsters while he watched.  Well, when I used it I hit him, too, and killed him (remind you of acidrain?)Anyway, Daos restored his stats and levels and if he wasn't cleared for that I take *full* blame.I know this has been kind of a jerky first day and I don't blame you if you want to kick my butt back to player.  But Necrite wasn't upset... And he's even trying to cover for me the crazy putz.Anyway, tomorrow I should be on and ready to do any job you want me to do so I'll hopefully seeya then.-Hermes"
