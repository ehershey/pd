__Letter "New Help FileMudEvents are things that take place when an immortal, or several immortals, get together, and build a questfor all the players to take part on.  When the time comes and an event is started, the length of the event is determined by the amount of questing the players must undertake.  The nature of the events isusually determined by the nature of the immortals whocode the event.  Most of the events basic goal is that the players work together to achieve something.In an event, players are asked to do certain things.For those who have missed a part of a event, or forfuture reference, to post a small summary on the TirunBoard.  This is not required, but it would be nice to those who were not able to attend the event.  At the end of most events, a reward will be givin to those who helped and participated in the event."
