__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Eilistraee to Aziraphale Thu Mar 20 05:35:34 2003:-----Well i got on this morning to give you a hello before i had to go to school, but you were net-dead. *gasp* So i suppose i'll send you a hello in an email this afternoon. Until then, let me remind you that even though i have an hour and a half free this morning during school, i will be using that to get homework done that i didn't do last night while i was...otherwise occupied. *wink* But this afternoon i will be sure to either reply to an e-mail you send, or, if you don't send an e-mail, then write up an e-mail to you. Well, it's time for me to leave for school now, so I'll see you later. Hopefully when i get home this afternoon. ;)Heather"
