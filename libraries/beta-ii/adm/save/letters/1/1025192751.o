__Letter "Aziraphale has no more guild. Now, I am not griping nor getting on you but this has to be said. Aziraphale has nothing to do with players, he was promoted because he has shown an aptitude in doing things I need help with, he has the time to do the things I need done, and most importantly, he actually wants to help me out. I have made it clear to him he will not interfere with players at all and if he does talk with players he will be fair and just. If you have any problems with Aziraphale the imm, if he treats you bad in anyway, you come to me and I will take care of it. I now have logs on all the commands that imms can do and I am keeping a close watch on mms. Specially after the who Wraith thing. Wraith was not punished for alot of reasons, the #1 of them being it had nothing to do with the game, what was done was between 2 adults on builders. Anyhow, if Faust had of asked for Wraith's head on a platter I would probably have given it to him. I do not want you to worry over this, or any players for that matter. I will keep a leash on my imms. I promise.Stormy"
