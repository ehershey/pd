__Letter "Room Description:This Room belongs to Helena and Tsuke.This room has a lived in appearance and looks to be very comfortable. There are some orbs floating around the ceiling lighting the whole room. The fireplace on the right side of the room is quietly keeping the room nice and warm. There is a large floating bed against the centre of the left wall, and a large window at the rear of the room. There is also a chest of drawers on the left side of the window.Bed: The bed is floating in mid air. There are rugs under it that spread to about 3 feet outside the edge of the bed. The bed, you decide, is really comfortable. (If possible could it be made so that people who are not Helena and Tsuke not be allowed to lie on the bed :P)Fireplace: this is you average magic fire; it burns with no apparent fuel source and keeps the room at a nice comfortable temperature.Window: The window opens out to a calm and peaceful beach; it lets a nice sea breeze in and keeps the room smelling nice and fresh.Walls: The walls are for the most part bare, they have portraits of both Helena and Tsuke, as well the revered symbol of the Illuminati.Orbs: The orbs are floating around the ceiling lighting the room, the level of light coming from the orbs seems to be able to be controlled by your thoughts.Drawers: (While it would be cool to have this as another point where we could store items for later retrieval, I can understand if we aren't allowed for balance reasons :P)"
