__Letter "----------------------------------------------------------.| Post number 41 by Nutrasweet...\"an old joke put to rest\"  \\`--------------------------------------------------------------------------Hello Merentha,It has been a very long time since I have last set foot on your textualsoils.  I know that once this post is seen this character will be destroyedand I most humbly accept that fate.  However, there is some buisness thatmust be put to rest.Due to a hectic schedule, I do not believe that I will be able to post thison the day that I was meant to post it so it seems appropriate to go aheadand get it out of the way now while I am thinking about it.In 73 days time, the person known as Sugarcandy (for all of your olderplayers) will turn 18.  Yes, she will finally be legal.  Most of you atthis point are thinking, \"Wow, I really don't care.\"  But to those of youwho understand the long running joke behind this, I hope you know that Istood fast on my word and get at least one last laugh from it.To Jewel and Pet, you have a wonderful mud here and I'm proud to see howmuch it has grown.  I do ask however that you not remove this post too soonin hopes that those who are meant to benefit from it will be able to enjoyit.  I hope you are all doing as well as I am.Sincerely,Me--------------------------------------------------------------------------,                                             \\  Finished Reading Post 41  |                                              `---------------------------"
