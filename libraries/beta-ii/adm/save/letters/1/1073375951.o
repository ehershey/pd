__Letter "Hey, just incase I end up getting to tired to stay up, I figured I would drop you a line to let you know I was around. Did you like the movie? I was thinking about going to go see it, but I'm still not sure... maybe you can help persuade me one way or the other. :)I wandered around rhondale, but didn't leave the little town. It was pretty boring. Made alot of xp (yea... I can't believe I actualy xped hard core for a while) in dunsinane, even killed the captain of malcoms army. got some diamondblade longsword. I haven't had them in forever. Anyways... I'll stop this mail for now. Catch you later.Cookie"
