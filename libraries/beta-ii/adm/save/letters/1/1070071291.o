__Letter "i can't stay mad at you.  but i am hurt that you stopped using the momotaro title when you changed your name to egg... and now you change your title again...it honestly makes me sad to know that you don't ever think of me and to know that you are never sad sighi always wanted to ask you to change it back to the momotaro one but i just didn't want you to get mad i kinda guess that you changed it back then cause you really were thinking about leaving me for a long time now. a lot of things i can think of in the past makes me realize it i should have knownit's just you were so nice sometimes...things went so well and we were so happyi just never....i dunnoi know you won't read this... but it makes me feel better to know i wrote it.anyway i know you're scared i'll beg you to come back or be really pissed at you, but i know we're never gonna be together againit makes me sad and all, but i get it, and that's fine.anyway i'm just gonna keep all your things and you can keep what little things of mine you have too, because i honestly do not want to see you again.you don't even want to be friends with me... so i have no reason to want to be around you.  i don't like.. meet up with enemies.anyway take care.-jen"
