__Letter "If you feel you need to resign, thats your deisicion.As far as this Carina business, I have been discussing this with the other admins, and we can't really understand your hatered for her. It is true I am no fan of her, she is very annoying and gets on my nerves a lot. However, this does not restrict me in how I deal with her. If you can't deal with her appropriatly, which I have seen you have not been able to, then perhaps law is not the best place for you to be. I have watched many times you and azire make comments about her while she is talking, and I have entertained them for the most part, however I feel you have taken it past the professional realm and moved it into the personal one, which is not healthy. I get angry at players all the time, but as soon as I log off, thats it' I'm done and when I come back, I try and start fresh again, it doens't always work, but I try.I guess my point is this, if you can't take this personal problem you have with her, and move it into the professional level, then perhaps you should either resign, or ask to be moved onto another assignment. My last mudmail to you was not a reprimand, but an indication to you that I believed you were taking it too far when it comes to Carina. So I leave it to you, I will not fire you over this, because I think you are just getting carried away, but if you feel you can't handle the challenge, than I will not stop you.You work here has been good, bug abuse is down, swearing is almost gone, and people know they have to obey the laws. That is not to say there havn't been problems, we can't see all, but take that with you as you end reading this mail."
