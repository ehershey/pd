__Letter "I would like to offer my services as a player who has been here a long time( and has playedI think every class in the game) for class balance. I feel I have no desire for any one class to be above another. Plus I have been a builder here for quiet some time, and I know how each class xps, and what each one could use to be useful. Anyway, after your done with the guild balance, I just want you to know I would love to help in any way possible with class balance."
