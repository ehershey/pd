__Letter "Okay, I was told again by a rather reliable source, that when pk is lifted, you are targeted.  So, I talked to Daboura, and we came up with a rather simple conclusion, but you might not like it.We feel it might be best when pk opens up again, that you start another char and not tell anyone who you are.  Just play that char for a few weeks, and hopefully, they'll find someone else to pick on with in that time.We think that these individuals just want to pk someone, and you fit the bill.  What Daboura and I've seen so far from you, doesn't merit a mudwide pk on you.  Of course if you still want to play Pyro, it is your choice, we can't force you not to play.Don't think that this is a coward's way out, it's more of a cool down period.  I would hate to see you not play your dragon because it's so badly damaged.  Please let me know what you plan on doing, so Daboura and I can plan our next course of action."
