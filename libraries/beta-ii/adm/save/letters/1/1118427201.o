__Letter "There is a LOT more to it than what i have said to mosta LOT more.Its not cosmic dust, the actual heartbeat of earth ischanging, it was 7.8khz, now its 12khz, Time itself isaccelerating around us, up to this point in 2012the mayans knew this.Also, ive heard of timetravel experiments (montauk experiment)which have tried to travel past 2012, they couldnt get pastthe invisible barrier.A 20 hour day now, is more like a 16 hour day.Also, the astronomical alignment on 2012 will be a serpent insky, with two sunsThe sun we have, The suns companion a darkstar, They bothwill settle on the dark rift and a brown dwarf and otherobject will complete the tail and head of the serpent.check out avebury, that is one of the standing stonesites showing it.I have found connections leading back to christian,Mayanegyptian, and many other religions.Hrmm what else..A third strand of DNA found by watson and crick, originallythought to be a prehistoric remaint, has recently beenfound to be bonding with our DNA again.. probably kickstarted by the alteration in magnetic field.We are all evolving, at different rates for eachindividual.Not only that, The correlations on graphs for disasterand virus's etc, As well as technology, ALL reach infat the 2012 date.Theres a heck of a lot of stuff.. too much for meto write down.. Some stuff i dont have evidence forbut im looking more and more for more \"official\"documentation.The ones that i do know to be true are:1) Graph Date for 2012 singularity2) Time accelerating3) Astronomical Alignment4) DNA, I do know we had a third strand found whetherits bonding or not im looking further intoI also know that on 2012, not only does ourgalaxy align, But so do two adjacent galaxies.So.. Perhaps its coincidence, But i have a feelingthat the Mayans knew more than most people thinkIts all a VERY strong connection, And with otherreligions demonstrating the same 2012 dateIll look more into it, I just needed to tell youa few things.Set"
