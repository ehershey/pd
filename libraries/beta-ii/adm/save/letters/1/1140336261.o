__Letter "Congratulations on winning the mayoral elections.  This mail is to tell you exactly what your responsibilities as mayors will be.  One of your main objections will be to keep the board clean of nonsense.  I would like to see the board keep around 40-50 posts.  I will be setting the board to a max of 100 posts since we have you guys to keep it clean.  This, however, is not the only responsibilities you have.  I would like you to be somewhat active.  Its cool if you dont log in for awhile, but if you going to be gone a long time, I would like for you to please mail me.  Another thing is new players.  You are the representative of Tirun.  You are a gateway from the players to me.  Please try to help out newer players and not scare them off with the mud politics.  Try to answer any questions someone may have and if there is a problem make sure to get them directed to one of the staff.  I will also give you my cell number so that if there is a major problem I can try to get on as quick as possible.  Please though, try to refrain from calling me before 9pm CST because it costs me.  Problems may include a game crashing bug, the mud goes offline, the mud freezes, etc.  I am usually unavailable on the weekends but I can usually take called after 5pm through the week.  You can leave a voice mail too and I will get it sooner or later.  Its 618-615-3063Please do not give out this number to any of the other players.  I would prefer my number not to get around.Your responsibilites should be effective immediately, but for sure after the next reboot.Whit"
