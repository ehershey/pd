I arrived at the hospital around 10:45am and gave the packet I was given to the woman sitting behind the desk. She told me that she needed to find out if Macy's required post-accident drug screenings, and then a few minute later told me that I would not be taking a drug test and she gave me 6 pieces of paperwork to fill out. As I began to fill them out, the same woman called me back over and told me that I would be taking a drug test. One of the papers that I was asked to fill out was one of a diagram of the front and backside of a human body along with a legend that explained that various symbols could be used to represent different types of pain and discomfort. I drew a very detailed diagram of where all of the pain I was feeling was, I marked my neck, my teeth, both of my shoulders, my left forearm, my right knee my left hand and my entire back. After I filled out all of the paperwork I waited a few more minutes then one of the nurses called me over to check my blood pressure. After she did that she handed me a plastic cup that I was to fill with urine for my drug screening. I filled the cup, gave it to the nurse and was told to wait in the doctors office. After 5 minutes or so the doctor came into the room, sat down and asked me if I had had an accident. I said 'Yes, a table fell over and landed on my back and neck at work' I was then cut off by the doctor who said \"Oh, so you're canadian huh?\""
