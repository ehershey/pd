__Letter "%^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^As you stepped into %^RED%^Dragoth%^WHITE%^'s room, you feel a slight cold chill crawling down your spine. It's strange that a bedroom has no bed.  The room is %^BLUE%^dark%^WHITE%^ and %^BLUE%^gloomy%^WHITE%^. To your left you see racks filled with the %^MAGENTA%^deadliest%^WHITE%^ weapons from all over the land. To your right is a giant book case filled with ancient magical books and scrolls of %^MAGENTA%^deadly%^WHITE%^ magic. The power that %^MAGENTA%^radiate%^WHITE%^ off of it is too strong that you had to take a step back. Right in front of you is a portrait of a beautiful young girl. At the bottom corner reads %^RED%^%^BOLD%^\"Love forever RMH.\"%^RESET%^%^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^  You try to get closer for a better look, but a cold voice suddenly screams \"GET OUT!!!\"%^RESET%^"
