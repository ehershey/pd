__Letter "<finger leviathas>I hope that's a Donnie Darko quote I'm seeing in your finger info.  If it is, I've found a new and renewed respect for you, my dearest old nemisis.  I hope everything is ok, sorry for leaving so soon earlier but the alcohol called.  I know.. drinking is bad for you and what not but still, gotta drown our sorrows one way or another.Hope to see you on again sometime soon.  Keep Set in check for me would you? Such a good kid.. needs a few more brains on his shoulders but still.. good heart, I suppose.Sug"
