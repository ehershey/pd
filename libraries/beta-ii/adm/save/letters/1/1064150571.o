__Letter "Dawn of a New DayThe day Crem was born was a day of terror and choas in the realms. The sky rained fire and the earth moved in agony from the destruction taken place on its surface.Deep in the caverns below the Daroq mountains a small group of the race of ferrel huddled together protecting their matriarch from the ravenges of the falling rocks. The matriarch was in immense amount of pain as she was heavily pregnant with her only child. The other members of the clan were worried for her safety as she was losing lots of blood from her continued labor, and it seemed that this child did not want to be born into such a chaotic land.\"We must be moving quickly as the hunters are quick to move in on us\" exclaimed one of the young members.\"We are unable to move until the matriarch has given birth\" an elder replied calmly.Just then there was a scream of pain, followed by a scream of rage, then silence.Posted by Crem at 10:46 PM Birth of a the Assassin!SilenceSilence follow by the sounds of a young ferrel screaming at the top of his lungs, relishing the fresh air, the sounds of dripping water and falling rocks, the feeling of life itself.\"It's a boy\" cries one of the elders as she looks towards the matriach, then stops suddenly as she stares at the matriarchs glazed over eyes, filled with pain. \"Our matriarch is dead\" she wails added to the noise of the newly born child.\"And you shall follow in her footsteps, VERMIN!!\" roars a mighty voice\"The hunters, we must fle.......\" Looking down at her belly, the elder stares at the end of a spear covered in her blood sticking out and grasps it in vain, falling to the ground whispering curses to the hunters.Continuing, the voice says \"Kill the rest, but save the child, he may be of some use to us yet\"In the half light of the underground stands a high Cleric of the church of Tirun, shining with an aura of holyness. In one hand he holds a Holy Hammer of Smiting, and the other holds a shining sceptre with a large jewel on the end.\"Take the child back to the monostry and hand him over to Brother Ton, tell him to teach him well, make an example to this race that they can turn from evilness, but most of all, DO not let him escape, for there are many other evils out there and I wish this child not to be one of them.\"\"It shall be, father\" says a robed figure standing behind the cleric."
