__Letter "Ok they holy war with ashram, he thinks it just gives him the right to pk u time after time, today he pk'd me twice within the hour looting both times, he did the same when iw as lvl 25, except within 5 mins of the first death... In total he has looted 10 diamonds, and has caused over 60 mil xp dmg to me... the holy war is a friendly role-play thing not pick on the new guy... 4 demons vs much more angels, and i don't even have magic defense or my abilities in rage.please take action against the harassment.(much set back) Aldur."
