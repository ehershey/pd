__Letter "As an option instead of doing it thru the guilds, Perhaps i candesign a \"mall of darkness\". Again, the staff would set minimalpricing but anyone that wishes to purchase (or rent) rights tosell things in the mall would be permitted to do so.Personally, I would like both options built. Let the people workin teams (the guilds) if they wish. The mall would allow the lonewolfs to remain outside the guilds and still publically trade items.==============================================================Just a reminder too, any objects that do not have a staff_pricenor a preset value in the object's code would not be sellableunder this system. The staff's prices is so that we can jackthe pricing on the rare markets like diamonds and red belts.=============================================================As an hourdurve, I'm going to be designing a new inventory system.It will show you how im going to be handling the over-crowdingissue that you stated Nulvect. The new inventory system will beused by the stores.IronmanPS -- Please get back to me here guys. I intend of breaking ground      this coming Sunday and you folks know it dont take me long      to code once i start on a project. Just dont wanna change      gears mid-project if i can help it."
