__Letter "Okay as you know Artanis the lvl 47 kataan was dested for multiplaying with his alt. Wedge. Okay he go dested fare and square. You might have already heard about Aziraphale/gabriels arguement about how unfare it is to be a dragon and how heard it is to become an angel. And even harder to become a demon.Okay I liked playing Artanis. Demons are fun. But i am not in a thousand years going to get another character to 50 then become one again. I had a thought. Becuase demon and angel are so hard to becuase. How about once a player has a demon/angel. They are free to pick angel/demon at the start of the game anytime. Provided that they only have 1 demon/angel at all times. So making alts that are angel/demon is not allowed. So if someone wants to change name/class. then can cide there angel/demon and ask you to make them a lvl 1 demon/angelI mean the demon to angel ratio is alittle to the angels side. alot really. I want to talk to you about being demon again. I am Artanis you know that right? Give me a tell and i will tell you something that will confirm that i am artanis. Yeah next time you see me on give me a tell can ya."
