__Letter "Lo Daos,So my guild was given away to some people without even asking :(I hadnt logged on for 2 months, thats not along time, but anyway, i find my guild was given away and noone asked me or anything about it, i mean im even on your msn list :PId like it if you were to mail me back about whats going on, as i would like to know :)Ive lost my ownership, my guild and my 800k in the fund, to ppl i dont even know :(lookWhy not ask Eios to sell acheron? or Mochaprincess about Scorpio or even try Etheral (who has no members). Just want to know why you chose 'The Chosen' and none of the others. @ months isnt a long time you know.Looking forward to a reply, thanks :)"
