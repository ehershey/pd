__Letter "Hello Nulvect. I've been directed to you by Pyro. Now from my understanding the mud crashed, and it had to be rebooted. Because of this crash I have lost alot of gear that I kept in my black leather pouch. I have lost 2 mage robes, a brass helmet, 2 brass leggings, a brass chest plate, a brass pendant, 4 brass shields, 3 brass gloves, 2 brass bracers, leafmail, and a couple of other minor things, bloody pants, shirt, golden platemail vest. I also lost 2 black daggers I was wielding.And a cloak of midnight i was wearing. I usually keep daggers and cloak in my lockers. And when i'm ready to log off I take everything out of my pouch. I truly hope something can be done to get this gear replaced. I havn't exaggerated about any of the gear. I hope you can look at a previous save file of mine to confirm these items. I really hope they are not lost, I have spent 2 weeks trying to get a second set of crystal gear to give to a friend. As well as those mage robes.Thank you for your time Nulvect. Please get back to me as soon as convienient."
