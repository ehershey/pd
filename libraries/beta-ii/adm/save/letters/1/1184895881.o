__Letter "No, we do not want players on builders. The problem is everyone will want to show off their work and new things will be well known by some before it even gets added to the game.But, I would like to have a handful of dedicated play testers to playtest areas before they are aded to PD. They would be the same people and have to be sworn to secrecy, etc. Maybe four or five players who would test an area after it has been oked by one staff member.Stormy"
