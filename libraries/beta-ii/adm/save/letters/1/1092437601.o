__Letter "Fri Aug 13 10:53:46 2004 from VenenumTo: Tsuke Azire Subject: Re; StuffTsuke, read the following in their entirety.http://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/niceguys.shtmlhttp://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/datejerk.shtmlhttp://seattlepi.nwsource.com/lifestyle/68913_niceguy03.shtmlhttp://www.nomoremrniceguy.com/ngs.phphttp://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/predicate.shtmlhttp://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/realniceguys.shtmlThese describe the person I am and the opposite of the person I want to be. Ido not want to be a whiny, winging, clingy, self serving slime. You come to me saying you willbreak off your friendship with me if I cease being the Nice Guy. All I can say is, if youwould condemn me to this life of misery and servitude, then you are not my friend.You can deal with that or you can leave my life and not come back."
