__Letter "I do not know what is causing this, but I saw and fixed a minor bugthat seemed to be affecting you. It will need more work to fullyfix though, this is just a stopgap measure for the moment.If you can give me more details, that is, exactly what you did andin what order, it would help me track it down."
