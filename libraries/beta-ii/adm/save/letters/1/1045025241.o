__Letter "We were in the arena fighting and I used one of the elitebard songs (suicide) and that makes a player a ghost.  He wentnetdead all of a sudden, comes back with 10 hp (what you getwhen someone resurrects you, didn't know it and dies)... I didgive Prator 200,000,000 experience to fix his stats/skills.  I was thinking since he died to the bug, should get somereimbursement.  I await your judgement."
