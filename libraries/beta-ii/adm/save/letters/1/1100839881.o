__Letter "I'm not sure if you forgot or you're busy with other things, but I thought I would mudmail you with a small reminder that I am interested in purchasing the inactive guild Chosen.We already spoke about it, but I know with all of the things going on in Primal Darkness with balance and stuff, it might slip your mind, so I thought I'd send you a friendly reminder.Thanks."
