__Letter "Vampire QUest:The quest will be a multi-level quest that has 5 lvled stages: 20-25 lvl, 30-35 lvl, 40-45 lvl, 50-55 lvl and finally from 60-65.  	Some Sparatic over all notes:		You can not have previously died if you wish to become a vampire, I am thinking of this as maybe death from a mob...rather being PKed is different, if this can be done that is.	Mini Quests - By Level:20-25:	/d/nopk/standard/cemetary/coffin7		Items you get:  Fangs	steps:		1. PK someone and get a limb from them (this could also be given to them 		or gotten in the arena)				2. Go to the \"Pale-Skinned Man\" in the graveyard, which is on the way to 		the Kataan Hall		3. \"Place limb on petal\" - Will start your quest to becoming a vampire.			a. The player will then be put into a trance, and they will have 			a vision with riddled details of the next part of thier quest.						b. when they wake up from their trance, they will be left with 					little hp, and have 3 rounds to leave before the pale-skinned 					man attacks them..of course he is a push over, but you are left 				with little hp so it could be slightly scary.***notes: if you are NOT between levels 20 and 25, nothing will happen when you \"place limb on petal\".  There will be a level check.30-35:	/d/lodos/secret3	Items you get:  Mirror		1. Consult a ranger and get \"poison\" herbs, then go to the secret area 				in lodos (the one in the west tower just north of the [])			2. \"Get bone\" - This will allow you to take the bone and then \"spread 				herbs on bone\" - will then make the bone flamable so you can \"Rub bone 				on altar\" - creating fire to \"warm the dried blood\" - so you can drink 				it.			a. Once you drink the poisoned blood, you will lose 5-10 stat 					points in all of your stats.  This is your sacrifice for this 					round of the quest.				3. Once you drink the blood the top of the altar will slide off, 				revealing a mirror, which you will then take.			a. once you pick up the mirror it will pull you into a vision 					showing you the next part of the quest (riddled of course).***notes:  This quest can only be done once a year: at Dusk (between the first night global and the second night global) on Qualtiar 13th.  This will also have a level check.40-45: /d/freepk/merkkerri/jungle/gcity/gcity53 and /d/freepk/merkkerri/jungle/gcity/gcity77 and /d/freepk/keys/great_sand/sand1	Items you get: Book		       Key		       Daywalker Cloak		1. Go into merk and defeat the merk queen (shazalla or w/e her name is), 		once you do (if you're in the correct lvl range) a book will fall onto 				the altar.  Which you then grab.  You will also need the Ruby Key from 				the Queen as well.		2. Go to the merk Sage (in the library west of the fake Queen) and hand 			him the book.			a. He will tell you to go to the island of \"crabs\" and dig up 					something old from something wrecked.		3. Go to Crab Island find the wrecked ship and \"dig through wreckage\" to 		find a coffin (this coffin was \"Drac's\" coffin which never got to him 				b/c of the wreckage).			a. The Ruby Key, combined with the rogues \"lockpick\" will form 					the \"Coffin Key\" (syntax will be \"combine ruby key and 						lockpick\")  This syntax will be on the side of the coffin.				1. This key will need some of your blood in order to 						work, it is your sacrifice for this part. \"Prick finger 					on splinter\" from the coffin and \"Rub blood on key\" - 						the key will glow and now be usable.						b. Once you have the coffin key, you \"open coffin\" and inside it 			is \"Drac's\" Daywalker Cloak.  Inside the coffin will be a 					message in blood giving the riddle to the next part of the 					quest.***notes:  You will be told about the lockpick before hand.  The level check will be in place of course.50-55: /d/nopk/tirun/hhouse/outside and /d/nopk/forest/path/room/outhouse and another room	Items you get:	Girl (who goes inside the mirror, she is the sacrifice for Drac)		        Key to the Layer		1. In the room after you \"search shadows\" you leave \"shadows\" and are in 		this room.  In this room you \"enter\" mist to a small area, which if you 			do not have the previous items nothing will happen.			a. In this small maze, there will be vampires = to your lvl that 			will give you the possiblity of death..if you attack 1 they 					swarm..if you leave them alone you'll be fine.				b. At the end of the maze is a \"Pure-hearted Girl\" who you must 				\"capture in mirror\".  But once you capture her, a bat flies down 			and attacks you.  You must defeat this bat, and once you do a 					bit of him will fall to the ground...which you must then eat.				1. This will lower your stats by another 5-10 points, 						giving you your sacrifice for this round.				2. You will then hear the girl in the mirror yelling for 				the \"man on the pot\", leading you to the man in north 						tirun that's on the..well pot.		2. You go to the man on the pot, who hears the cries of his daughter 				(the girl in the mirror), and throws you into the toilet, which is 				actually an entrance to where the \"vampire slayer\" is.			a. You will be locked in with the \"Vampire Slayer\" who has the 					key you need to get out of the room, and get into the layer.  					You must defeat her.			b. On the key is an inscription to the last part of the quest.**notes: Level check as usual.60-65:	/wizards/amun/eyeofhell/rooms/middle_44 and transfered to /d/lodos/secret1 and a few mazes as well as the final layer.	Items you get:  Outlaw Flag		1. Go to Drac in the eye of hell and \"Show mirror to Drac\", He will 				ask you if you wish to continue the quest to become a vampire (just in 				case) and you say \"yes\" then you will transported to the secret room in 			lodos with the mirror and the corpse (on the east tower opposite the 				other secret room).			a. Drac will be there in spirit form (voice in your mind) and 					he'll give you directions: \"Set up mirror\" - this will place the 			mirror opposite the other mirror in the room, this action will 					bring the corpse to life and will try to attack the girl, you 					must kill the corpse and save her..she is Drac's sacrifice). 						b. Once the girl is saved a note will fall off the corpse, which 			contains an incantation that will act as a portal back to Drac, 				taking you and the girl. Drac will then Drink the girls blood, 					she is your sacrifice to him.  He asks you to join in drinking 					her blood, and the second you do you are thrown into the Hall of 			Mirrors.		2. The Hall of Mirrors is a maze, but a simple one...You are looking for 		the room that does NOT have your reflection in it...I think either have 			it to where you're name is in the room like a mob and you're looking for 		the room that you're name is NOT there...or by description if we cannot 			do the other thing.			a. In the room with no relfection you must \"Smash Mirror\" to 					lose your reflection and then enter the door that is behind it.  			You are then thrown into a lit area.		3. Because you're beginning to turn vampire you are partial to the light 		and it will do damage to you...This means you MUST put on the daywalker 			cloak to move through this area.  If you do not you will lose a enough 				HP to make it deadly (there will be something in the description that 		tells you basically this stuff).			a. You move through the area and come to a gate.  A few rooms in 			this area, It will tell you to \"break my jaw\" and \"insert 					fangs\".  You will not be allowed to go through the gate unless 					you have inserted your fangs. Once you do, you'll be in the 					Garden outside the layer/mansion.		4. Move through the maze of hedges and get to the door..it's that 				simple.			a. use the key you got from the \"slayer\" to get into the layer.		5. You're in the layer! Now just follow the last maze and find the Head 			Vampire!  When you find him, he gives a speech about ways of Vampires, 				but he is just a voice at this point...  At the end of his speech he 				reveals that he has been inside of you since you at the bat.. OMG he IS 			the bat!!  He command you to \"cut stomach\" so that he can be released 				from inside of you.			a. He takes his true form and asks you if you truely wish to 					become a vampire, if you say yes he will drink your blood then 					offer his blood.  If you say no (you're an idiot HA), no if you 				say no he will instantly kill you and you will lose everything 					you had on you.		6. Once you have been bitten and drank the blood of the Head Vampire, 				you return to the beginning with the \"Pale-skinned Man.\"			a. He will tell you that you must stay in the underground grave 				yard for a full 24 hours of unidle time (lasting through reboot 				and everything) there will be a start room..this will be where 					the class hall is (if that's cool).			b. Once you're 24 hours is up, you will be a Vampire and a 					global message announcing you're mortal death and your new 					immortal body and you will be informed that you're now a 					Vampire.  If you leave the room, it was for nothing and you are 				not a vampire and must start over a new character.***notes:  This MUST be done at night, and you MUST have an evil aura (which will be said in the first vision), as well as 90 in ALL stats, and you MUST be Demonic or Satanic, Perception MUST be MAXed.  You also MUST be outlawed (meaning PK someone in a law area) before going to Drac in the Eye of Hell (you're life is your final sacrifice)."
