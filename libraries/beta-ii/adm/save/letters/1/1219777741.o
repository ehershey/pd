__Letter "Hello Nulvect. I was inquiring with Pyro on perhaps some exceptions to the outlaw ruling of killing someone in a law area. Now Pyro did indeed say there were exceptions to not gaining an outlaw tag. But Pyro was not sure weither he could tell me. So he has directed me to you. So I suppose my offical question is. \"Me(freddie), being a demon. If i were to kill, or be killed by an archangel in a law area. Would the winner of the fight recieve an outlaw tag.\".If you cannot answer this question. I understand. But any clarification you could give me would be wonderful.Thank you for your time.Freddie"
