__Letter "The bow is very tight slender and strong , it looks as if you could shoot something from miles away, the string is made up from a piece of mythril so that it will not break.This dagger has a razor sharp edge, with metal spikes juttingout of the side of it, the spikes look as if they are made out of some special kind of metals.The sky is dark and you can see the stars for miles. Under your feet you notice that the ground is made up of nothing but gold, and that the bushes next to you have dozens of red eyes glaring out at you, you feel very uncomfortable."
