__Letter "Let me point out again the fact that Demon kataans can use demonfire and massacre together every round, and that demonfire from rubicante *never* fails to para, that demonfire does damage and para's, that there is no drawback to spamming demonfire, That kataans can also use dakzhul with massacre and demonfire at the start of combat.plistAlso, as long as he is casting demonfire, he cannot be paralyzed himself.I wish *I* could cast holyfire, lifewarp and paralyze every round with no drawbacks.Sorry for the tone but please tell me either that this is 'balanced' or that you will fix it.I seem to remember you saying that demonfire should only para 60% of the time at the maximum.Anyway, I got 120 rooms in to replace the banged up ones you said couldn't go in with my area, hopefully this will be ok. I will plan extra \"lost in the forest\" areas to tack on to the path, and then villages and other areas to go on the end of those at a later time. - Prator"
