__Letter "So as the entrance to the angel quest (the riddle) can only be accessed on one mudday, but the room is markable by wax or gate, is it legal to go to that room and mark a wax, and then use the wax to do the quest when you hit level 50 on a different mudday?  If not just let me know and I'll wait til the next mudmonth.  Thanks <3"
