__Letter "It works the same way my player exit block does but here it is:put this IN the create function:     add_pre_exit_function(\"stairs\",\"go_stairs\");put this at the bottom of the code outside the create function:int go_stairs() {  if(!this_player()->is_player()) return 0;  return 1; }and that should fix it, just replace \"stairs\" with the exit you need blocked, you can use the same pre exit function for different exits without adding another int go_stairs. Just put in another add_pre_exit_function with the next exit you need blocked but have it point to the int go_stairs"
