__Letter "Hey love, this will be my main guy for mailing and getting mail. :)Right now, you're prolly sleeping. I hope it is peaceful and restful and junk. :) Moving is such a chore but I hope you cansneak in a little fun for yourself here and there. And when Tuesdaycomes, I will be oh so happy to talk to you. :) Until then, take care, my love. You will be missed very much. :)Love,James"
