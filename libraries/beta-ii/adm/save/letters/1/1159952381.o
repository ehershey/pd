__Letter "Just had another idea for the candy...You could have little flying monkey-bat candy things, or something, and when you try to eat those, they fly away and cackle. Maybe they even call one of your witches down.Also, a grim reaper candy. When you eat it, it pulls up a fake death screen. Then at the bottom it says, \"just kidding\" or something.I haven't coded in a few years, and what I did was really simple stuff... but that one should be pretty easy I think. The candy just triggers the death disc text, but doesn't transport you anywhere. So when you look (l) you'll still be in the same room.Just something to freak people out with ;)"
