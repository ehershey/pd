__Letter "i dont know if you need more skill to prevent this, or if its just me, but when i first log on and xp i have no problem. I usually use hellfire to xp, and its normally just one round, like cast it holds me back till the end of the round. Lately ive been havin a problem where after awhile of xpn, i will cast it and it will take 2 rounds for it to let me do anything again. It use to be like once every while it would, but now it seems like its happenin more and more.I was just curious about this, not complaining or anything, just didnt know if there was something wrong with me :(appreciate you takin time to read this."
