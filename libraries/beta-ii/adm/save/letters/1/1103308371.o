__Letter "Baby:Since I'm going to be resting anyway, Trev is taking his laptop in for upgrading. He said he's taking it away for a day or so - so that I can restup and won't be tempted. I'm doing okay, just tired and it's probably because of all the stuff going on,I guess it caught up with me, but I'm okay, no worries.One of my friends will be posting things on my journal. I'm making one commentand she is going to add updates under the comment area.Don't worry, I'm okay, just need rest.Will miss ya, lovR."
