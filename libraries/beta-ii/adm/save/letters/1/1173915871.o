__Letter "I was writing to once again inquire about having Mazrim and Agent UN-arrested.. I asked about 6 months ago last I think so I figured i'd give it another go...To refresh your mind i'm pretty sure both were arrested for attempting to avoid law deaththis was quite a few RL years ago...Recently I logged on to find that someone had hacked almost all of my characters and suicided them.. So in light of this I would greatly appreciate me being given back my old characters..Hope you reconsider, thanksJustin"
