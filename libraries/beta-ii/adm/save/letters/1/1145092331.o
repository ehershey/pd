__Letter "Honestly this is pure crap. I logged off Vyce and onto Rhuan with no intention of PKing. A guildmate asked Rhuan over darksoul line to PK Scamp and told me he was in tenebrae throne room, so I did.And since when has 2 PKs been a spree? Dalamar killed 3 people at once... and 6 people in 5 days (which is the reason I PKed him incedently). 2 has never been a spree. This is pure crap. I didn't break a single rule."
