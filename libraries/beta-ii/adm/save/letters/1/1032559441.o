__Letter "i have reason to believe that kabniel has cheated wth the dragon quest on the date on 9-18-02, for unless you call opening up the safe b4 the note repops and telling another player to lok downstairs in order to make another player not get the quest after waiting a long time, very long. and the other, now dragon, also getting the potions bcause she finds the other player immature. i believe that this merits at least a search. thank you."
