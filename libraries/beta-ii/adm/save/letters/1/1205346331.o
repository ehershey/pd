__Letter "Cenn, I plan to get to the bottom of this stuff. It seemed likeRohl booted you just cuz he wanted to, not because of anythingyou did out of line. I will see what I can see. I dont like thiskind of crap when we are in the middle of trying to build andother guilds have gained pre-eminence over us. And by other guilds,I really just mean Forsaken. I will keep you updated.Esco"
