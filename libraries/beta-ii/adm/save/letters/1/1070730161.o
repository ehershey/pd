__Letter "also, kalohe and silverdreams no longer have chars as well.  i'm not too sure ds has much to worry about as far as enemies are concerned, at the moment.  since faust, blind, and sc left, ds somehow became really.. dull.  (which in a way is very good -- less drama, no war)  however, it still is a security hole...fortunately other guilds (enemies) don't have access to our current members list, however there could have been people in the guild previously who might have saved a members list...very doubtful, but i think that we should make sure to be as tight as possible, there's no harm in being 100% secure.  sorry for buggin, tell amy i said hello :)-jen"
