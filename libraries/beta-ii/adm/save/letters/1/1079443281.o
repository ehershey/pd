__Letter "The Primal Darkness Book of Dragons, abridged.Dragons, General.  Species:            Draconius <species classification>; <common name. Eg, Draconius Dens Rutilus; Red Dragon.  Origin:           The origin of dragonkind is not known for certain amoung the scientific community, although the priests of the land will each tell you a seperate 'truth' about where the first dragon arose from. The scientific community naturally rejects these claims, although there is always some doubt about the tales; folklaw and superstition are often founded in fact after all. Certain sects claim that the dragons were born from drops of the blood of the Gods, although the author finds this dubious at best, while naturally bearing no ill mind towards the dieties of the land. What cannot be denied, however, is that the dragonkin have their origins at least partially in the divine: no natural process could have created beasts of havok and chaos such as these to walk upon our land. Unfortunately, the druids of the land (relunctant at the best of times to release any information stored in their many tomes) regard their information (such that it is) about the origin of the dragonkind as most sensitive and refuse to divulge even portions of it. It is therefore the author's speculation that, while the druids of the land could possibly shed more light upon this theory, it is more likely that this 'information' they claim to possess is next to useless anyway. Despite the difficulties obtaining information from the druids, readers are *strongly* advised in the most strict terms to avoid raising the subject around half-dragons or full dragons as many a budding scholar has found their career shortened alarmly at such a request. And so it is that I admit, due to a complete lack of information, the true origin of dragonkind is unknown at the time of writing.  Subspecies:               There are five known subspecies of dragon, with most being identified by a predominant colour or marking scheme. The scholars of the land agree that, although a reluctant bunch on the whole, the four main types of dragons are those which can be identified by colour. The four primary, known, colours for dragons are a bright crimson (which seems to darken with age), the deepest pearlescent black, a pure almost blinding white and a dark azure. The fifth and last subtype is extremely rare and often mistaken for myth, although there have been simply too many collaborating stories about it's existence (despite the unreliability of the sources, often madmen or hideous beasts) to deny it's existance. Commonly known as a Chimaera, this fifth species appears to be the creation of twisted experiments gone hideously wrong. Often in great pain, generally bearing a short lifespan and with none of the power of a true dragon, the Chimaera is a creature to be pitied. Of course, if the body of one such creature was to be recovered a more definitive study can be made and more concise remarks made. It should also noted that this is not a complete list; a creature as robust as a dragon is sure to have spawned many other subspecies, and the absence of firm evidence should not be taken as the absence of the creatures.  Physical characteristics:                             The physical characteristics of dragons vary greatly between the various subspecies, although some general statements can be made about the species as whole. Dragons of all species appear to be primarily carnivorerous, although they have been known to eat plants and even whole trees on occasion. Their dental and digestive systems are well adapted to allow them to consume almost any foodstuffs efficiency and draw energy from them, although they tend to favor meat above plants. Most dragons are between six and twenty five feet tall, although this figure is largely subjective as it depends upon the subspecies, age, and posture of the dragon, amongst other things. Dragons possess four large legs, two fore and two rear, which are finished in 'hands' which are three fingered claws, with an additional forth claw pointing backwards. Dragons are physically very flexible creatures, often able to twist their bodies literally into knots without much effort. The skins of dragons are quite soft and supple although they are covered in a layer of incredibly tough, interlocking scales. These scales are larger over the belly region, smaller over the back, tail, neck and legs. The leathery skin between the bones of the wings bears no scales, nor do their eyelids, although the skin at these points is noticibly thicker and stronger. Dragons have binocular vision, although the sheer distance between their eyes and the elongation of their muzzles gives them a blind spot just above their maw which again varies depending upon a number of features. It is not known if Chimaera's bear this blind spot or not, although due to the feline nature of the beasts it is assumed they would not. Dragons see in full colour, and extra spectrums which are invisible to human eyes, and have little issue seeing through darkness, deep water, fog or bright light. Their bones are light but extremely strong, forming a solid skeleton and base for the creature to exist upon. Thick wings sprout from the shoulders of all dragons, giving them all varing degrees of flight.  Psycological traints:                         Although often painted as evil creatures, dragons simply consider humanoid life on the same level as cattle; albeit an occasionally dangerous and magic wielding cattle. They are, therefore, seen as extremely arrogant towards lesser species, although they are known to be extremely respectful towards their own kind. This respect is only broken in a few situations, as discussed below in courtship and social characteristics. Generally speaking, all dragons save the benevolent white prefer to speak their own language in dealings with dragons and non-dragons alike, irrespective of the listener's ability to listen and understand the words spoken. Only when the dragon has a significant amount to gain from the transation or feels in generous mood will the creature actually switch tongues to one which is known to be spoken by the listener. This is least likely with a black dragon, who would generally eat the listener for their ignorance. Dragons pay a significant amount of respect towards the celestial and demonic beings of the land equally, and although they may not actually *like* or dislike either they respect their devotion and their battle poweress. The white dragons consider the Demons of the land corrupt and foul, while the black consider Angels self-rightous and facist. Both of these opinions are relative of course and may differ between individuals of the species. Generally Dragons consider Illithids (due to their high intellect and predatory nature) one of the more acceptable of the lower races, although this is only a slight distinction and should not be relied upon should a dragon be encountered. Little is known of the psycological traints of Chimaera's, although most scholars knowledgable in the area agree they are, by and large, insane.  Courtship and reproduction:             Dragon courtship is by far the most complex of any species alive, and it more then anything else varies greatly between the various species. Very general statements can be made however, and each of the subspecies' specific behaviour can be examined in further detail further down in this text. Many a bard's love song has contained verses about dragon's love, although this sort of behaviour is almost always attributed to the white dragon. In terms of the physical reproductive cycle, a female dragon of age typically comes onto heat once a year, the timing of may or may not be the same each year, but is often in the middle of winter. As a sentient creature her control over her heat is significant, and while sexual arousal may become more commonplace during her heat she is in full control of her actions. When heating a gland near the base of the tail produces a chemical known as a pheramone which is designed to attract dragons of the opposite sex, and more specifically, dragons of the same subspecies of the opposite sex. Again a male under the influence of this chemical will have his judgement mostly intact, although again sexual arousal is more common and easily achieved. For most dragons of both sexes, the base of the tail is considered an extremely sensitive and private area to touch, although the lower half of the tail is not so (please, for your sanity and mine, ask no questions about how this information came to be known). Analysis of the severed tail from a female and male Draconius Dens Rutilus (Red Dragon) supports this theory by showing that dragons actually bear pleasure receptors near the base of their tails, although they seemed more plentiful on that of the female. This also makes the tail, like the sexual organs of humans, very delicate to the touch. It is considered the hight of rudeness to touch the base of the tail unless engaged in the act of mating, much as it is considered the hight of rudeness to touch the chest of a female human unless engaged in a similar activity. It should be noted that the tail of a female dragon is one of the most powerful indicators of sexual arousal that dragons possess; the signals are complicated and reports are vague and contradictory, but it would appear that it plays a significant part in the mating ritual. See the white dragon section for more information about tail signals. The physical act of mating differs significantly between the species and is covered in more depth when each individual species is examined. Chimeara, by all accounts, appear asexual and not capable of reproduction. The species is, instead, propigated by magical or scientific means.  Social characteristics:                          Typically dragons bear a strong loyalty to their own kind, with the exception of the Chimaera which is seen as the lowest class of dragon and barely above cattle. Dragons often band together for support, protection and company, although some prefer to live our their (extremely long) lives alone. Small family groups are by far the most common social groups of dragons, although larger groups have been reported in various locations. Large groups of dragons generally go to extreme lengths to keep their location and numbers secret; the presence of such powerful creatures has often driven fearful humans, orcs and other races to seek them out and end their existance. A challenging task at the best of times, but still, while almost all dragonkind look down upon humanoid life they do respect their capabilities. Many a young, strapping fighter seeks their rite of passage by slaying a dragon, something dragons are not too happy about.White dragons are, by and large, extremely respectful to other dragons, giving inclines of the head, partial or full bows when another is met. In parallel to human behaviour white dragons incline towards polite, respectful behaviour towards strangers and become more casual and friendly when a closer bond is established.  Draconius Dens RutilusAttention all, My name is Sasayaki Miyamoto. I am your locally designated dragon-and-mythological-beast remover for the Tirun area. I take the view that an ounce of prevention is better then a pound of cure, and this will be the focal point of my drive to remove all dragons from the land. The first step is, as with any pest species, to remove their food source: As I'm sure you're all aware, dragon's favorite food is barberqued wench, in particular, female virgins. They cannot, in fact, stomache anything else; therefore it is my selfless mission to remove all virgins from the land of Tirun in an effort to remove this scourge from our lands. Even if you're not a virgin, but female, you may report to me anyway, as one can never be too careful about these things.Yours faithfully, Sasayaki Miyamoto."
