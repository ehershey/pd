__Letter "Eh Storm...Orcha originally \"contracted\" Unholy.  however, Palin has already PAID for our services.  We were hired on a contract here.So I have merely accepted a contract, paid in advance.  We were contracted for a job to be done and i plan to carry it through.(plus, it coincides with Rp as well...I am extremely offended by open worship of someone other than Asmodeus. I am a radical devoutist with some things ya know)Chosen never used to have a named diety, so there was just as good a chance they worshipped Asmodeus, and didnt know it really.(Neutrality is a tricky thing like that ya know)  Plus to make it worse, they dared commit heresy towards me!  They blatantly INSULTED me by trying to coax me into becoming one of THEM.  THey're unwanted cultists in my eyes.--I wont make any moves against them, for now.  Cause i want you to know, and understand more, my reasoning for so openly accepting these contracts offered.(Also...Vian just REALLY pissed Bellos off rp wise on a regular basis, he provoked me and Unholy a HELL of a lot)--Also, i have one question...Why was it allowed to be bought without asking Vlad anyway?..  Had me and Set 'wanted' to buy unholy, we would not have been allowed to, unless it was offered willingly upon the other leaders' returns...Just outta curiosity here though.(still dont wanna buy Unholy, Lev is back, and its AWESOME!)"
