__Letter "Just to let you know I mailed out the package today, so the lastest (crossing my fingers) should be monday.Also I forgot to mentioned in the box, the potato chips inside are suppose to be hard, so don't think they are stale, it's just the way they are made.There is also a japanese treat in there that needs to be eaten up, share with people or keep it in a waterproof box inside the fridge, but I wouldn't hold onto it very long, it's rice.  Also there is japanese candy inside called white rabbit.  When you peel off the wrapper, the candy looks like it is still wrapped in a clear paper, you eat it just like that, the paper is rice paper and won't harm you.  Faust and I try to get a variety of stuff in there, a lot of it and I marked which ones, you can stick a little bit inside the noodle soup I sent along with it.  It will just spice up the soup.Let me know when you recieved it, I did insure it just in case anything happens to it, and I do have a delivery confirmation notice on it just in case you forget to let me know :PHep"
