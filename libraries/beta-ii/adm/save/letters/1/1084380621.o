__Letter "Hey WHit, how goes? :)Recently Daos added our new swords that i coded, however i dont think he checked the formula of the specials on them. I dont know the 'correct' formula to put in them so i added one i made up so i could see if the special message showed correctly, etc.I thought id leave the special formula to a admin, so as thoguh it wasnt to overpowered. SO yeah check it out and fell free to edit it, thanks :)"
