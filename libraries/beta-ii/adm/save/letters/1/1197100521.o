__Letter "Hey sweet, lady. Decided to mail you on my lunch break. What a night I'm having! The students are in rare form. :) But, I was able to get my break around the usual time and figured I'd drop you aline. I hope everything's going well for you and you had a great day. Talk to you, later. :DLove,James"
