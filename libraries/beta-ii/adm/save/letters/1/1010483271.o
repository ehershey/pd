__Letter "this is a newbie starting townyou shouldn't have an EVIL imp wandering around town if the stupid freaking gate guards are going to be assisting the evil freaking imp.That was a stupid death for nothing.  Then to top it off, because they're still assist the EVIL imp I can't leave town or I die, which I did BTW.Calling it an EVIL imp means it can be killed and shouldn't be assisted.  Make it stay in one room or something.-Staver"
