__Letter "Today i got to lvl 50, got massacre i was so happy i would finally be somewhat good. But i am sure it needs to be upgraded, how are demons ment to survive against the hordes of angels with a lame ability like massacre, a angel with max faith at lvl 50 can do like 900 dmg to everything in the room when a demon can only do 500 if u are lucky to 1 thing, this is also with pretty good stats, a 310 stat total. not to mention the 2 rounds makes it totally a rip off.... need like 250sp to even do this lame move, then take 100 sp off when u do it, so u really can't do much with it. with the 2 rounds 2 gores will do more then 1 massacre, therefore 2 slashes will do even more... maybe make melee a bigger part of it, i noticed i maxed melee (78) points, for like 20 dmg and then i got the same amount of attack and it went up like 70 dmg... that might help, even look at holyfire to work out what would make it equal or even better since it only hits 1 creature in the room.P.S. after doing this can the demon abilities be added to rage."
