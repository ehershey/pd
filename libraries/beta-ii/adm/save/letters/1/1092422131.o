__Letter "I have just finished reading all of the websites that you have sent me. And If You are going to become a 'good guy', if you like the terminology better, then good for you. That is the david I used to know, and hopefully will one day know again. For now, you have turned into the bastard (arsehole, cunt, whatever) that you have been declared your desire to be. I never wanted you to be a self serving 'nice guy' (if your following the 'profile'), and quite frankly, never thought of you in that fashion. I hope you manage to get through this, and the rest of life. I personally think that your going to have some hard times infront of you, and I hope you come out alright on the other-side. One day, perhaps, I will see you on the other side. But until then.Goodbye.Goodbye.  - Dane Thomas."
