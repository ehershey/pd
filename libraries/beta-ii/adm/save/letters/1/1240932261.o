__Letter "Hey mj, it's josh, i tired sending you offline msgs, but i guess you didn't see them. i'm also on telnet so if i have any typo's please forgive them lol. i was trying to tell you that i'm sorry i didn't call, but i didn't have your number, my mom erased the caller id before i had a chance to get it off of there and i didn't remember it off the top of my head. so i promise i wasn't ignoring you ro...or* anything, just edidn't know how to get ahold of you. please call me back. you can call me on my cell, it's 615-482-5647"
