__Letter "i was wondering if i could make a request. I don't know if it is allowed to ask etc, but with a lack of immortals or admins being online compels me to ask any way.Helena was caught in a bug during the angel quest where she became stuck, just before you get to the final room where you can choose to become an archangel, the room bugged or somthing when she rescued the girl and so she completed the quest, but didn't go to the final room. now seeker came online and helena go taken back to tirun [], she went to do the quest again (hoping that it wouldn't bug again) but the girl that gets rescued started to tell her that she had already done the quest and didn't need to be there (or somthing) and she became stuck again, hence unable to get to the final room and unable to choose to become an archangel.my request, should you choose to grant it, is to put helena in the final room where she can choose to become an archangel. i don't think this is too much to ask, as she has completed the quest already and all she wants is to become an archangel, but as been unable to due to a bug.     Thank you.          - Tsuke."
