__Letter "Here are the plans I have for fighters:Warriors - they will have abilities that use multiple weapon typestogether, such as grabbing someone with a whip, pulling them in, andstabbing them with a knife or sword. Lots of double-wielding abilities,so probably nothing with shields.Berserkers - a couple more axe moves, a bunch of melee moves, anda few blunt abilities, coupled with fury-style abilities that willwork mainly on the user like adrenaline. Probably an intimidationmove or two. Rage will probably change just a little bit (for the better).Ranger - hunters. They will have more bow and spear moves, as wellas some defensive and stealth abilities, and a few of their extrathings like brew still need work. Maybe add different herbs they canfind.Paladins - paragons of good, riding into battle with a sword in onehand and shield in the other. A shieldbash-style move seems appropriate,--More-- (62%)Joker replies: and jesters are just naturally cooland some defensive spells. Abilities that work better against evilthings are also in order.Antipaladins - evil, nasty, torturers. They will gain some whipabilities, and a spell to create a whip, much like mysticblade.Attack spells and perhaps some debuffs, or even stealing otherpeople's stats.That's how I envision the various subs... please feel free to suggestideas along those lines (or outside of them even)."
