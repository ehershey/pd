__Letter "Hiya, I hope you and your family are doing well.  It's hard sometimesto come on here for long periods of time.  I'm not sure how often I'll beon for awhile, because things are pretty busy here too.  So, if I don'tcome on for awhile, you'll know why.  I hope things are going well for Josh.  Take care of yourself,hugs,Rayna :)"
