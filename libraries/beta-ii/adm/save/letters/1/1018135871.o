__Letter "A mortal experiences the ultimate death becoming a vampire, releasingany earthly power they had and starting their new eternal life.  Theyare, despite popular belief, quite alive.  This confusion is usuallygenerated by their fascination and close relation with death, howeverthey will never again suffer death or destruction.  They are foreverlinked to the physical world. If they sustain too much damage thattheir regenerative abilities cannot compensate for, a fraction of theirpower is taken and used by mother night to fully heal and transport their bodies to safety.This basically explains that a vampire is alive (and extremely healthy) but they are immune to death.  If their HP goes below 0, they don't die, they just \"lose\" and mother night uses up some of their power (since there needs to be a penalty for losing in the game) and sends their body to another location."
