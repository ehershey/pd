__Letter "Stormy,    The domain is finished transfering over. I have changed theowner, administrative contact, and billing contact all to you,and left me as the technical contact for the domain. The domainwon't expire until 12/2004, so we don't need to worry about itfor another year. Let me know if the whois db info I put for youis correct.wiz"
