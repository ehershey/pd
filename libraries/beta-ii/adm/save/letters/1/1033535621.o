__Letter "I got those swords back man, they were taking damage so Eios sharpened them for me.I found out everyone who killed me and got all my shit back.Ancalagon looted me and I told him the swords were his and you were my best friend so he told me to get you to log on. I said you were out but you trusted me enough to give me your password, so he gave me the shit anyway. I left Forsaken and sorted everyting out. It's all good now.Peace man."
