__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Trooper to Whit Sat Dec 30 12:30:23 2006:-----MUDs are here for a reason. That reason is to provide an alternate reality for people like me to enjoy without worrying about the outside world. You've posted your liberal jargon on two muds that I play. For starters, you're posting nothing but bullshit that cry babies want you to believe. Secondly, politics don't belong on PD OR merentha. The problem with America is not \"warlord presidents\" The probelm is uneducated idiots believing everything they see on television."
