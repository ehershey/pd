__Letter "Hey, I thought I sent this to you earlier, but noticed that your finger said you didn't have any unread mail, so... sending it again, sorry if it's a repeat.I was wondering if you were in need of any more Imms.  I would like to do behind the scenes things such as making new systems for coders to use (working on some inventory searching functions on builders), maybe classes, races, skills, etc., and especially making objects that require special coding for special or unique abilities.  I could also make areas, though I'm not as good as I would like to be at doing room descriptions (which won't stop me from getting that island done).You can contact me on the mud (either player or builder port) or through MSN or email.  I should already be on your contact list as MrW (w0rm@programmer.net).  You could also talk to Daboura/Durst since he's my roommate.Thanks!-Nesoo"
