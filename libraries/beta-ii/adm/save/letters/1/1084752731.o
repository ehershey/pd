__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Kumi to Venenum Sun May 16 08:22:55 2004:-----Venenum, as an immortal you should have known better than to bring this to thepublic board. You did not need to make any posts at all, either on the Etherealboard, or this one. This is NOT PD business. It's really just...pathetic thatyou would do this. It's dramatic, immature & irrational. Something which youhave been for the past couple of days.We never asked you for your help, all I told you was to implement the guildchanges. I didn't want to tell you this at the time, but the reason I didn'twant you going through everything to \"balance\" it or \"work out bugs\" was simplybecause I do not feel that you are competant enough to do so. I'm sorry if thatoffends you, it's not my intention. After the night before last's display, Iknew then that you were definately not competant enough to be helping us inthat way. Evolution & I had to explain to you how to do the smallest things,you did not find any *bugs* in our code, we did, and we either told you how tofix it, or we asked you to remove it altogether. You misread a lot of our code,simple things, that an immortal should understand and not \"misread\", it's allbasic math, really. I am surprised at my recent discoveries of your codingabilities.And your threats to Evolution...that was just immature. There's nothing elsethat it was, really. He did nothing to break any rules, we do own our own guildboard, when the guild was first made, it only cost 2.5m, because we didn't havemuchto be added. There are no bills for Stormbringer to pay, because wizprovides PD with free hosting, so Stormy really doesn't have to do anything.Anyway, you and Evolution should remove all of your posts, because they reallyshouldn't be here on the public board."
