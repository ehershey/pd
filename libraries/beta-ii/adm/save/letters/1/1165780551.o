__Letter "due to the major problems we've had with DS lately, i needed to take you out of the guild. I want you in it, but i cannot have a dedicated DS member who is never on within LS and ILL and mainly on DS alts in the guild.  Basically it comes down, them or us.  When you decide let me know, we'd love to have ya and i'd love to have you take over if i end up leaving..but cant have the DS thing in the way.sorry"
