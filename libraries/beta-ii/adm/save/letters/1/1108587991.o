__Letter "Spade was just a cheat character made from Whits accountif you check the age, 40, then playtime you should be able tonotice that. That character does not have cheat statsAnguish however was the character made who was a demon-antiwith 120-150s in mains, Then he powered to elite and remortedto Demon Thief.I didnt think anything would be done about it, Even thoughi know first hand that its the truth. How do i know first hand?Firstly the coin, That was manipulated from Whits accountthats how the cheating took place in the first placeStill, All logs are deleted from and by Whits accountPlaytime and age are adjusted accordingly.. Its a pretty muchfoolproof method of cheating.Shrug, Cheating imms and admin are your department though.Set"
