__Letter "Wiz was online and I got him to do a little investigation.Someone made a char with Prator as the name and cided later, so no backup of the proper level80.In other words I be fked, and I don't feel much like sticking around with imm, since it all kinda feeels for nothing atm. NS arrested Amarael for me.So yeah, you don't feel like doing that manual setting of char like you did for Rubicante/Ithilgore and all that after they came back from imm?I'm just going to restart Aziraphale from level1.I think this would probably be about as depressing as PD being set back to PD1 or something. Just an absolute *insane* setback and nothing feels worth anything.:(C'ya."
