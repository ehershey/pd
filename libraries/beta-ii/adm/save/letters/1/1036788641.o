__Letter "Tirun-As tensions escalate between the two factions, crowds huddle in fear from the fight that is going on above their homes.  The tickle war between the demons and the angels is heating up, and no one feels safe.\"It's just horrible living here these days! At any moment you could be caught in the middle of either side and... and... tickled!\" cries on resident before promptly being tickled by rogue angel Hermes.Indeed, this war of ticklition has already had many casualities, the worst from the apparent mutiney by several of the angels and the insanity of a few demons.  Both of these deserters now wonder the street, tickling people at random with such brute efficency that many fear to leave their homes.Demon Seth, when asked for an interview, declared his intent to avenge the tickle of his beloved slave wench Cookie and take revenge on the angel Hermes.From the other side of the fence, a distraught Endbringer mooed sadly, rubbing his wings and almost shaking from his recent tickle assult by two demons who ambushed him.Trully, this is a horrid war that the world will not forget."
