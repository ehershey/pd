__Letter "Hello love, sounds like you're getting some better rest, I hope. At least there's some quality family time. :) The past few daysat work have been pretty tiring. Lots of walking around, climbingendless steps, etc. But exhausting in a good way, I guess. :) Ihave been having trouble getting to sleep early, too. I don'tknow exactly why that is, but I've been xping Uzamaki a lot and heis up to 189 wisdom. :D Kinda proud of him. Freddie says he talkedto you about WoW the other day, hehe. He sent me this article kindabashing it a little. But I think you use it as a fun place which isjust fine by me, as I want you to have all the fun you can handle.One more night of work and then my weekend! Then, maaaaybe, justmaaaaybe I'll be fortunate enough to catch you on. :) Who knows? Nopressure, o course. :) Freddie and Rohl are squabbling a bit. Theyhave tried to kill each other and Rohl got Aethion involved for someextra sneakiness which I will explain later. :) So, Freddie bannedUza from buffing them and their alts! The drama is so tasty! heheBut, please take care, rest well and enjoy the family. I'll bewaiting for ya. :)All my love,Your James"
