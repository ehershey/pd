__Letter "Faust, using one of his alts, found this post from cookieMessage 32 by Cookie: Looking PoolOk, a looking pool was made by Wraith in builders. You look into the pool andyou can see someone. It's basicly like the \"scry\" spell, only anyone can use itand it's free, costing no mp. So, yea... any more questions?I did have that file in my dir in builders, someone either went to the room, or scanned my files. Somehow cookie found out about itgive me a tell when you get this mail if im online."
