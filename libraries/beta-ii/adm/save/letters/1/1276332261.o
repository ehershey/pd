__Letter "I need to chat a little more with you. few thinks need ironingout before i code more here, problem is im feeling like my workturning builders into a setting that not only people could workin tandum but aid eachother DIRECTLY and more importantly learnfrom eachother. I feel it was sweept aside without even beinglooked at. Yes, it was documented in several places (boards,emails, even /doc) as to it's workings.im feeling like my future works would be equally dismissed*sighs*If im to stay, i want to know how we will proceed here."
