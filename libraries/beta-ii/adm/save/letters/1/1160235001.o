__Letter "a                   projector recieve <builder>                               This will allow the one who entered                               the command to see what the <builder>                               is typing provided a) the person is                               on the <builder> list and b) They                               answer that it is ok for them to see                               their work. If either is false, they're                               denied.I feel this would make creator to creator teaching easier. I thinkwith the safeguards i outlined above it would prevent abuse sinceit requires double concent from the person being watched. Archs and Admins would retain the snoop command anyways if theyNEED to watch someone. It's just this would give builders a wayto concentually snoop one another providing the \"target\" grantsaccess and then agrees to the person watching.Ironman"
