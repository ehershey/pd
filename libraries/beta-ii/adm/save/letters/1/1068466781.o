__Letter "Hi this is Wisp, last night i was in the square and Galdur was having a go at Helena.  We didn't know how to harass log stuff so could you please tell me....I've seen worse but it did upset her.Galdur smiles happily.Helena says: well, make an enemy of me then, though i suspect you're already half way there, little boyImp arrives.Galdur nods solemnly.Galdur fondles Helena.Imp leaves east.Galdur says: i got the right to do thatGaldur winks with a sparkle.Helena kicks you in the ballsFlabber says: -= ow.. =-Galdur grins evilly.Galdur says: heheHelena says: and if i ever meet you in real life, i'll have a right to do thatGaldur frenches Helena deeply.Kai walks in with a can of Mountain DewKai mutters \"Do the dew!\" and fades off northKai walks in with a can of Mountain DewKai fishes through his pockets examining some money.Galdur says: lolHelena <newbie> how do i report harrassment?It was the fondling and frenching that got to her and i know.  I was wondering if someone could have a little word about sexual harassment before someone gets too upset.*hugs*Wisp"
