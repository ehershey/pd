__Letter "Daos and I discussed builders. We decided to put the modifications I didback in place. Namely the party modifications that blocked calling otherbuilders. The party system would allow those calls and allow builders tosnoop one another but ONLY if they're in a party together.This bars people from using call and eval to screw around with others whilegranting them the added power to snoop eachother. I will be slipping itback into place this week. The security system i wrote is now in place.Only part i need to do for it is the more command and put the scan testsinto the commands like stat."
