__Letter "Hey Cutie, Thanks for the mail, I like them to be long anyways considering it gives me something to read and plus it's from you so I already know it can't be bad. :) But none the less tell your Dad I said happy birthday although I'm sure you can figure out a girl name for me...Rachel, Denise, hell you can use anything you want :P. Oh, and I\"m sorry you have all that work to do, if I was there I'd try helping you do it but I'll offer as much moral support as possible. It's 11:12 my time and 9:12 your time, but non the less I do miss you lots and I hope I get to atleast talk to you for a little bit this weekend :).Yours Truly,JoshOh, and p.s. I do love you, hehe *blushes, waves, kisses, and hugs* Bye Cutie."
