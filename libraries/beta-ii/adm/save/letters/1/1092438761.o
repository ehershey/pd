__Letter "But that's not who I *am*, nor who I was. I'm not on a quest to become an 'arsehole', per se, I was simply looking for the right way to express it; 'Good Guy' seems more appropriate. Read my livejournal for more complete information. I do not want to care less about people. I want to care more. But to do that, I must first care about myself."
