__Letter "1. An entrant must be active for at least 2 weeks prior to acceptance. \"Active\" being up to the discretion of Leaders and/or Council.2. To be a part of Forsaken, an entrant is not allowed to have alts in another guild.3. If you plan on PKing somebody, you are required to first post on the Forsaken board who, and the reasons for it. You will be contacted by a Leader whether or not we feel the reason is adequate. PKing for no reason is grounds for dismissal.4. You are allowed to have alts in the guild, but they aren't allowed above the lowest rank.5. What is said on the Forsaken line is expected to stay there. Other people do not need to know the going-ons of the guild. If anybody has any issues with any of the above rules, feel free to contact a Leader with any issues, we would be happy to hear your thoughts on it. While not a rule, if you plan on no longer being a part of Forsaken, please share your reasons for it, not just leave without reason. We want this guild to be an enjoyable place for players to be, and criticism, whether good or bad, is accepted."
