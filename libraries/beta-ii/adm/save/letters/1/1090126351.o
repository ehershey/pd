__Letter "I was just killed by a death bug,I accidently hit eios with a room effect spelland fled the room, one of his triggers went off and i waskilled by it in the next room, i have a cut and past log ofit and eios can vouch for it also, i was hit in thenext room by the trigger.I had 400mil on me at the time,and now iam back to 259607189 xp.All iam asking is, is it possable to have thatxp given back at all??Thank you for your timeOrcha"
