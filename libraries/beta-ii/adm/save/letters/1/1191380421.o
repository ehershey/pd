__Letter "I don't understand, it was blatently left in the open?  So she could have figured it out on her own?  It doesn't matter at this point really, if the players are right and if she did use private info while talking to them is in the past, I just wish someone had told her that the info she has come acrossed on private lines were to stay that way...I remember when you told me about it that I had to be very careful with it, and had to treat all situations like I don't know the whole story (adlibbed )Anyways, how's your son?  I bet he's getting big!   Less than two weeks before I move out of this hell hole.  Hope all is well with you, and don't know when ya get on, but hope to see you on soon!Hep"
