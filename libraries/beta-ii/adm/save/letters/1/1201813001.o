__Letter "got those couple hours. Hit the snooze bar a little more than usual, but no complaints. :) I mainly allowed things to sidetrack me and then it was around your sometimes arrival time. I was nearsleep when I heard your music. And I thought I didn't reallywanna turn down the chance to say hi real quick. Since you alwaysmake me feel better. I will try to stay on schedule better. Also,dont think any of it is your fault in any regard. It was a merematter of seconds, not hours and barely minutes. :)I hope you have fruitful sessions today. Please take care!Love,James"
