__Letter "Hey Resolution,I am sorry I haven't been on recently. I read the board and thats why I am mudmailing you. I have had a seriously bad migriane that had landed me several times in the hospital. Its very hard to look at a computer screen for very long let alone a text based game. I hope that the doctors figure out what is causing this so I can get back my life and soon.Just letting you know so you dont boot me and understand the situation. (I would also like to keep this private, I share with only those that need to know). If you need anything else from me please either mudmail me back or contact me thru Rohl. Thank you for understanding,Lucy."
