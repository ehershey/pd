__Letter "Solas was removed from the guild, because he had LS,Forsaken,Illuminati about to start hunting everyone in DS, also carina made a deal with yang that if i was appointed leader of DS none of these guilds would be after DS. It might not sound that bad, but it would have been worse. Now me and yang both agreed solas would be removed, we did not have to reject him, he, himself offered to leave the guild because he knew he had caused trouble. Now he wants back in the guild but he was the one that chose to leave before we had to reject him, I am considering to re-induct him into the guild, but i know most of the guild members i have talked to so far do not want him back in the guild. I know Yang probably wont want him back in either. If this makes you mad im sorry, but that is how it had to be, he brought it upon himself. I dont know all the facts behind it, but what i just stated is what i know for fact. Once again sorry for removing the post explaining it, I must have accidently removed it :\\Thanks,       Zubaida"
