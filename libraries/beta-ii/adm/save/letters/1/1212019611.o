__Letter "I would like to reapply to be a member of the staff here.  If the files that I was working on still exist, there should be a pretty good start to an area in my old directory.  I am feeling inspired to code a few quality rooms each day.Alternatively, if this is not to your liking, perhaps the directory can be transfered over to the builders port?I would be more than happy to discuss this in an interview.Love,Leviathas"
