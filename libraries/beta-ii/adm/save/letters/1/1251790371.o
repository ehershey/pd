__Letter "I tried to work a bit on fmud and I think I did something right though it is still not working. I went to the demo page for Fmud and copied his source code and put it into a test file and it is at http://www.primaldarkness.com/fmud/fmud2.html IE actually tries to connect to the mud now instead of Null but we end at a security error. Just thought maybe from there you can hopefully figure out what the problem is with ours.Stormy"
