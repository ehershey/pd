__Letter "Arr!  We be the Pirates of Primal Darkness, the Black Sails, and yebetter watch yer land lubbin neck, because when yer on our ocean, theschooners we ride will blow your dinghy out of the waters!  Sure, onthe land, ye be findin' us while we be raidin the towns, fightin' inthe taverns, and snatchin' up yer wenches, but when we get em' on thesea, they be ours, and you best go find new ones, 'cause they ain'tgoin' nowhere soon!  Welcome to all the sea lovin' rogues out there,but if ye walk the plank once, ye won't be comin' back aboard our ship,yo ho!  We be tighter than most, a family of fiends, but when ye do uswrong, yer off the plank and ye don't get to walk it again!  Sure, ifye be with us ye be with us, but if one of the mates ain't likin' yersmell, none of the mates are gonna be smellin it!Arr, we say, and we be sayin it loud!"
