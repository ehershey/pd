__Letter "Dear Rayna,    I'm missin you too. I almost wish I didn't sleep in an effortto see you, but I know, I know, I need sleep. Bah. I gotta workon two papers. One is a movie review that we've gotta look atfrom a sociological perspective. Kinda looking forward to it. :)I hope for you the weather lets up soon, so you can travel asyou please. The weekend should be doubly sweet. I will be virtually done with school, having just one open book test lefton Monday, for the semester that is. And, there is the prospectof Rayna time!!! Well, I guess I will try to get to kickin'some booty in the name of academics. Stay you. :) Love,James"
