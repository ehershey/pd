__Letter "there was a problem with that certain deed, I didnt know to report it to the people who made it, but I did fix it so the catch tell would work right.clearmoon already knew about the reward for the deed and was the one who told me that there was something wrong with it, so no problem there with me telling what was in there.I also checked the sage and added Demonish to the old language, it does work but I dont think many players know about the 'ask sage fix' catch in there. I also added hawaiian to the fix language code in therehope to see you soon and can you let me know why your IP was listed in the hack report log 19 times on 7 different names?laters, Wraith"
