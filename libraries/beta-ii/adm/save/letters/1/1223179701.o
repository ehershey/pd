__Letter "Hey, love. I hope you're doing well and have had a good night'ssleep by the time you read this. I had planned on going to sleepshortly after I said goodbye but then I checked and watched thelatest Naruto cartoon online. They finally subtitled it, heh.Anyway, after that, my eye felt better after watching in the darkso I watched a movie with Myra like I said I would. We watched'Atonement' which was good, but racy. And LONG! Then I thought ofyou. :) I feel bad if I do something I didn't say I'd do. I amsure you'd tell me not to, but I suppose it can't be helped attimes. I wanna spend as much time with you as possible. Anyway,that's my confession. Please take care and I'll talk to yousoon, I hope.All my love,Your James"
