__Letter "Sorry that last mail was so garbled. Was on the pain meds atthe time. Lemme explain clearer this time.What im intending is this. Take an item. Any item will do.For this example i will use a diamond. What happens here willbe 3 checks when the diamond is deposited into the repository.     1) The staff_pricing will be checked. This is a mapping        that will be in a central object. It will hold the        LOWEST limits that the staff will allow an item to        be sold for in the store(s).     2) If no staff_pricing entry is found for the object,        the query_value for the object will be checked.        If this is 0 as well, the object is LOCKED into        the repository. It will be deleted at reboot and        NOT reloaded. This is optional but i recommend it.     3) The guild_pricing is checked for the object. If it        is higher than the staff_pricing, then the object is        placed for sale at that price in the guild's store.     4) if the person entering the object into the repository        wishes to charge MORE than the guild does, the price        is set to seller_pricing.In other words....     Staff sets diamonds to sell at a min of 2,000,000 gold.     Guild wants to charge 4,000,000 gold.     Player wants 5,000,000 gold.     The diamond will be placed at a price of 5mill gold.     1 mill going to the seller. 2mill to their guild.     2mill be decided by you guys. Perhaps split guild/player.     perhaps a sale's tariff on the rare objects that are set     over a certain level. I can code it for just about anything     we want here.============================================================The system will not allow the player to sell lower than theguild or staff wishes. The guild can not set their min pricelower than the staff prices.IRonman"
