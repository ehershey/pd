__Letter "Before Daos left, i was talking to him about re-instating Yang.  He was arrested a few weeks ago for \"multi-playing\" and i explained to Daos what happend and he said that it was ok and to talk to an Admin to bring him back.  What happend was that I was at work and logged on as Ying and my gf locked her phone in her car and was logging on to tell me.  We dont have a home phone so she thought that was the only way to contact me.  As soon as she logged on as Yang i logged off Ying.  There was no interaction what so ever, not even a tell.  Pls mail me back when you get the chance. Another issue was about being able to bring my alt Tai.  if i am not able to bring back the character, could i aleast start over with the name, it is my irl nickname and it may sound wierd, but it means alot to mePls let me know what you think when you get the chance.Thnx"
