__Letter "01/27/03I read through most of the sites you gave me and Ihave to admit my feelings are mixed.  I want this typeof relationship. I want a master whom I can serve andknow that he loves me and will protect me.  I want tobe his prized possession, what makes him most happy. It's funny.. because up until yesterday.. I thought Iwas just weird but now I'm seeing that there a lots ofpeople who feel the same way.  As much joy as it givesme to know that I can belong to another being and putfull trust in him it still scares me.  So many peopleare untrustworthy.. and I'm already a fragile person..what happens if I trust the wrong man?  There's somuch at risk here.  Not to mention so manymisunderstandings that can occur.  Don't get mewrong.. I don't mind the thought of a good spanking..it's just.. that can go too far.. and like I saidearlier.. I have a hard time saying no.overall though, I'm ecstatic.  I've always wantedsomeone to just prize me.. and let me make them happy.I want nothing more than to find the perfect dom andmake him happy. It's odd being able to say that.. toexpress that.. and not feel bad about it.It's kinda like.. all my life I've given everything Iam to my boyfriends.. and never felt it returned.. Inever wanted to be please.. always wanted to please..and now.. now it all makes sense.  That's a relief. But now.. I have to find someone i can trust withthis.. someone other than you and Wisp.  I dont knowif I can trust another guy like I trust you.  Idunno.. I just.. I know you're not going to try tohurt me and all you want is to help.  I want to be someones submissive so badly.. it'slike.. I've adentified why I feel so empty inrelationships.. and now I want to fix it.. but at thesame time.. I no way in hell ready to jump into this. Oddly enough.. as much as this is all spinning aroundin my mind, I dont feel any different. I don't feelodd.. or like I don't belong.. or that I've changed. I feel just the same and I think that's a good thing. for some reason as odd as some of this stuff I readsounds.. the thought of doing it or being involveddoesn't come as a shock to me.. it's like.. all thishas been waiting in the back of my mind and now it'sfound its release.  while I once only entertained thethought of being completely open with another person..completely free to just be theirs.. i can now acchievethis.  I'm amazed and just.. happy i guess.  I asked you to help me because, like I said, I trustyou, and I know that you've had enough patience todeal with me up until this point.. so I'm pretty sureyou could have patience with me while I'm learning. i'd also much rather learn with someone I know beyonda shadow of a doubt doesn't want to harm me.  You know.. the sexual aspect of this type ofrelationship (while I have to admit gets me wet at thethought) isn't everything that I want.. I want toactually please my Dom in everything I do... ya know?when he sees me.. I want him to be proud to have meserving him, pleased by my service, and I want him towant me.  My heart starts beating so fast just tothink about being wanted and loved so deeply that I'mfree to serve with all of my being. I'm willing towait until I find the person right for me.. I justwant to do everything perfectly.. so when I find thatperson.. he'll know that I only want to please him. LOL.. it's so crazy that I can say this stuff to you. This is like.. my greatest desire in a relationship..and it's achievable. Wow.. I wrote a lot.. and I'm not even sure i wrotewhat I set out to write. Sorry if it's disjointed..maybe I'm just going crazy..YoursSugar/Heather"
