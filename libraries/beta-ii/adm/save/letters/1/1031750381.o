__Letter "The life of a ScoutIt was late afternoon  there was a slight fog in the air and I could hear artillery firing in the distance. My mission was to give the commander information on the latest movements of the Germans, we have been held down in this sector of the city for weeks. I have already been scouting half the day when I stumbled upon Seth Williams, he was lying there eyes glazed over a bullet between the eyes. Seth and I were both scouts our mission is to go deep into the enemy territory and see what they are up to, there movements what weapons they have if they are getting reinforcements so our superiors could plan a proper attack. A strange sound came into my hearing then out of the corner of my eye I see a panther tank accompanied with a squad of 10 soldiers each with sub-machineguns, I hid behind a half blown up wall, the churning tracks of the tank was unbearable. "
