__Letter "Yesterday, I was PKed by Eios (under Carina) and I was PKed in the sewers.  I am not objecting to the PK, as it is a part of the game, I am however, I guess a little unaware of something.  I (as Goldenberry) PKed Tauran in the sewers a little while pack and when accidentally entered the tirun [] I was sent to jail: this is B/C it is a lawful zone.  However, when Eios PKed me in almost the exact same spot, he then went into the [] directly afterwards, and yet nothing happened.  He was not sent to jail.  I am not asking for anything back that I had lost, I just wantd to know why I had gone to jail, and yet he had not.  Thank you."
