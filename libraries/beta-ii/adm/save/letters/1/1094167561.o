__Letter "few points1) Almost everyone knew that Centaurs, Elves, Archangels, Demons, Giants and Ferrels had far better stats than the other races. Not due to any privelegad information, but simply because players make more than one character, and they compare each other's stat costs.2) I did post a long time ago on the imms board just what was wrong with the stats.3) It wasn't like I put up the exact costs. I put up how the races should look in the help file.All I wanted was for it to be fixed, so all races were pretty much equal. What I think one of hte most important things in the mud as for a player to not be penalised, directly or indirectly, for wanting to play a particular race.Or class/subclass etc."
