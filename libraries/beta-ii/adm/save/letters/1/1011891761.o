__Letter "guild stores will only have oil, stones, drink and food in them, but 20% of all proceeds spent in a guild store will goto the guild treasury. The items can be customized, but must cost at least the same as other stones and oils and be of the same power. If a guild buys a second hall in another town it should include a portal of some kind that will magically teleport a guild memeber to the main guild if they enter it. For extra money, like 20k portals can lead from the main hall to the other halls too.If I think of anything else, I will let you know :)Stormy"
