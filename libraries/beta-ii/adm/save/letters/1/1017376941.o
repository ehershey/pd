__Letter "My problem, my problem is that you keep on bothering me. You are always trying to make it look like you are this big tough person who knows everything and that I had better watch my step around here because you would kill me on a whim.It's your whole attitude that annoys me really, you automatically assume I have said something I haven't, and then get angry at me about. It's stupid, people have been saying all this stuff defending kymas, and all I said that he killed my friends, and that it would not have happened if angel quest was opened sooner.What also annoys me about you, you seem to just poke your nose in my affairs. Telling me to start a holy war and pk artanis, whether or not he is in my guild. You can't just tell people what to do Wraith, and if you try, it's not exactly the best way to get on their best side.Really, sending a mail that says \"What is your problem anyways\", it's just being rude, if not just plain insulting. You could just say that to me next time you see me on, jeez.	- Aziraphale"
