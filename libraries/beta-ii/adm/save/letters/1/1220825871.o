Time appears to be standingstill, balancing on a hairpin.dodgeTime seems to have stoppedhp: 8|sp: 452|mp: 1518 >  You hear a low applaud.Daroq says: Bravo, bravo.Daroq says: I must admit, I had my doubts about you...Daroq says: But you have allayed them.You see a shadowy figure materialize behind the great hound's head.The figure approaches you.The figure looks carefully at the great hound, then carefully at you.Daroq says: Of course, you had no chance against this beast. He is far strongerthan you ever could have hoped to be.lTime seems to have stoppedhp: 38|sp: 452|mp: 1518 >  Daroq says: But you surely must have known that before attacking him..Daroq says: You must have decided that his destruction was more important thanyour own safety.Daroq says: I must say, I was not expecting this from you.The figure makes strange motions in the air.Suddenly, the great hound explodes in a large combustion of incredible magicpower.Autosaving.tell pyro thats so messed up :)Time seems to have stoppedhp: 72|sp: 452|mp: 1518 >  You find yourself once again on your feet.tell pyro thats so messed up :)Time seems to have stoppedhp: 79|sp: 452|mp: 1518 >  The figure wanders slowly over to the destroyed remains of the great hound,then kneels down before it and starts flaying its skinDaroq says: Make no mistake, this creature was every bit as dangerous and itsdestruction every bit as important as you were led to believe.You hear a deep chuckle.Daroq says: Your intervention, however, was far less needed than you seem tothink.The figure finishes its work and stands up, then turns around to face you.The cloak of shadow falls from the figure's shape, revealing an old man who,despite his age, appears to be in top physical and mental shape.Daroq says: In fact, you were not needed at all.Daroq walks over to you and holds up a thick bag, made of the skin of the greathound.Daroq says: Doubtless you were expecting a reward... I would say that you haveearned one.A few drops of blood roll off of the bagDaroq says: This should do for you. You should find it has a much greatercapacity than those diamonds you mortals seem so fond of bandying about.Daroq emits another low chuckle as he hands you the bag.Daroq says: In getting this far, you have revealed many things about yourself.Daroq says: You have displayed a wit and attention to detail like none other.Daroq says: You seem to be able to distinguish between situations when haste isrequired, and others when slow, deliberate action would do best.Daroq says: And regardless of whether it was born of evil, of good, or ofsomething else entirely, you have shown that you are willing to put yourphysical well being at risk, should it be required of you.Daroq claps and a dagger materializes in the air above him, falling into hishands.Daroq says: I have no interest in mortal politics, and dragons are nothing morethan mere mortals to me, although they may not like to hear that through theridiculous pride that clouds their heads...Daroq says: However, you have passed my tests today, and so you have earnedthis. Do with it as you will.Daroq hands you the dagger.Daroq says: You will find that to be incredibly vital in the near future,should you continue on your current path.A great mass of flames engulfs Daroq, leaving nothing but a small pile of ashbehind."
