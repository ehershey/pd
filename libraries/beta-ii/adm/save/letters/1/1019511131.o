__Letter "How about making the random thing for slash and stab only active on monsters within a certain range of the player, like you did with the XP cut? it would help out on killing time and still give the sort of balance needed. monsters close to the players lvl would reviece the full amnt of stab/slashes while monsters smaller then the player would recieve the lesser random amt?"
