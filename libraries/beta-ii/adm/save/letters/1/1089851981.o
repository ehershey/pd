__Letter "All the colors of the ocean swirl together to form an impressive statue of a dragon so blue the sky pales in comparison. Small wings flank its large body, raised in a defensive pose. Its long tail coils around its clawed feet and up its chest, coming to an end in a little twist just below the dragon's open mouth. One of its cerulean eyes seems to be missing."
