__Letter "I am writing you today to discuss the future of the Illuminati.  I have been playing Primal Darkness for the greater part of 3 months or more.  I would first like to say that I have enjoyed your game throughly and I have had a lot of fun playing.  However, with fun must come buisness.  I am here to address the inactivity of the leaders of the Illuminati.  I feel that this once great and powerful guild is losing its momentum.  Paranoia, myself, my alts and a couple others are the only active members of the Illuminati; this concerns me greatly.  I would like to see The Illuminati as active as they were before all of its' leaders became transfixed with World of Warcraft.  I, Goldenberry, would like to be given the chance to make The Illuminati what it once was and become a leader of the guild.  Every guild needs an active leader, and as you know, I am an active player.  I would like to thank you for building this world for us all to play;  I just want to help build a little part of it by bringing The Illuminati back up to its potential.  Thank you.Goldenberry"
