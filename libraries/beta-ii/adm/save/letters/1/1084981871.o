__Letter "Players talk to ME over ethereal. I will answer them when they do - even if it is personal. Otherwise I respect Kumi's dislike of me and do not speak over her line. However - I firmly believe that the rule about immortals/admins being excluded from guild lines should be changed. It hinders me in doing MY job, and I know the other Immortals feel the same way. "
