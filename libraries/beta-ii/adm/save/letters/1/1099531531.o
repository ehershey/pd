__Letter "sorry about the lengthy mail. im gonna come up with a proposal to daboura for most of that stuff i talked about....i realize blue dragon is one of the least concerns to the immortals as there is one out of the active 4 (that i know) hehe..so basically...daboura said the only things he can't handle are adjusting the hp for dragons per level/con (nulvect seems to think they should get 6 mp per wis also..) and also the skill cost of dragons..i dont know if skill cost is even ever going to be changed..but one that should be cheaper is defense..hehanyway, take care:P i hope yer not agrivated with my mails lol~ draven"
