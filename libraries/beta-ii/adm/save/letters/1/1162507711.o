__Letter "The addition i made for privs.db and groups.db was ment to bea temporary thing while i was working on the concept i discussedwith Stormbringer. Once i'm done, we will be able to set peopleup who wish to do teamwork. Before this i intend on finishing the work on _scan.c then building the _tutor.cWhat i have in _scan.c is a small taste of what the final versionwill be able to do.Ironman"
