__Letter "hey you might get a lot of these, you might not get so many, but i'll come up with random ideas as i xp =P -1eat corpse - you can eat a small item of food from a shop and get more sp than with the 'eat corpse' command. i'm not asking for a LOT, but could it try to be put into perspective? you're eating an entire corpse and if it makes us full eventually, so be it. my sp is drained after every fight, usually below -100, and it takes forever to continue in certain xp areasuhh i think that's all i'm good for right now, but i will probably come up with moreSmokey"
