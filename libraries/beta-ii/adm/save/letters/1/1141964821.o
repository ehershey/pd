__Letter "I need one of you two guys to peek at these 2 files ;/wizards/ironman/waterworld/level4/monsters/selection_lvl4.c/wizards/ironman/waterworld/level4/rooms/template4.cI keep getting the following error when i compile template4.c*bad argument 1 to call_other()Expected: string or array or object Got: 0What is going on here??More importantly how would i correct it??I'm trying to master the inherits mainly to keep the memory use for the mud low.It's easier and more efficent to define a function/functions and then inherit them into the target object.example :::I plan on having a battery of commands for my Atlantian centurions, another for the guards, another for the mages.I'd much rather define them once and pass them into the file with an inherit then have them hardwired into each monster file. That would waste memory.Please peek at them and mail back to me as to whats wrong and how to correct them.Ironman"
