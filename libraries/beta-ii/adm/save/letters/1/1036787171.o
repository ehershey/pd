__Letter "hey i got some ideas for vampires..well for one on the help file it says they go through a different death sequence. i was thinking that vamps dont have a 'deaths' on score or bio. they dont have a list of how many times they died..for they are eternal. i hate how muds keep track of how many times i died lol..thats why i cide most of the time. i like 0 deaths :) but for vampires this actually makes sense..no deaths!! plz!! *puppy eyes*ok. also drain spell..it drains hp and sp from target and gives it to the vamp. bite = doesnt turn the target into a vampire but merely does damage *shrugg*charm/seduce/gaze = stares at target and puts them under his controlbloodlust or thirst = i was thinking in order for a vampire to survive he needs blood. kind of like a meter measuring how much blood he has in him. like a hungry status in a sensethey need some sort of magic damaging spells death/undead related. yes i am a mook"
