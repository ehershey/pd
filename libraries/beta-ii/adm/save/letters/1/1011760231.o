__Letter "The Dark Souls Guild is a ruthless band of people that would cut your heart out and show it to you then say hello. Hired killers, everyone of them, they strive for the bigger better job. If you need somebody killed, contact Wraith to sort out the price. The Dark Souls Guild main hall is located in Tirun city and will have other halls across the continent soon. If you ask for help, more then once, in finding the Darksouls Guild Hall you will not be allowed to join. If you tell anybody the Hall location you will be pked once by every member of the guild, this includes members."
