__Letter "Here's some ideas I have had:Pyromancers:cauterize - heals hp but deals body damage (coded on builders)flamewall - fire surrounds you and hurts things in combat with you  each round, it doesn't follow you between rooms (coded on builders)melt - melts random wielded/worn metal stuff, partially (lower ac/wc)  or completely (destroyed) and damages limbs it was onimbue - give fire elemental to weapon or armourNecromancers:putrefaction - causes body damage over time to all attackersSorcerors:psicrush - lift up two (or more) attackers and smash them together  in the airDruid:drown - surrounds single target in water, doing increasing damage  over time for a few rounds, druid has to concentrate on it  (coded on builders)Jesters:cartwheel - hits all attackers and has chance to knock them down (coded)taunt - opening attack that gives -def, +att and random paras for a few rounds (coded)Wizards:ward - gives a def bonus to target besides the caster (coded)Scouts:runningleap - (needs a better name) works like backstab but must be used  from an adjacent roomThugs:grab - steal, but higher success and the person always sees youBards:lullaby - put things to sleep (+para) for a few rounds, can't use in combatI have a few more, including some summons for kataans, but that'sprobably too many for a mudmail already. Let me know if you wantto see my code or want to hear more."
