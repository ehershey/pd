__Letter "was thinking on your little sky there and thought of something, would you think that you can put in a little autofly, you set the coordinates of where you want to go and it takes you there automatically.  Here is why I ask that question....Basically only dragons would be able to fly in the new world, and fly really wouldn't be any much easier then to say steer a boat so what advantage would fly have?  Make them still find the areas and there would be two ways to fly, either auto, or manual.  If you don't like that idea....idea 2maybe have it where they can fly north 5 and it automatically flies them north 5 times, I'm just trying to give the special race some kind of advantage when they are flying...it won't be instant like it is now, but it would certainly be a little less workI think you did a great job on it already and once the buggy stuff is taken care of, it has lots of potentialhep"
