__Letter "//its bad, but its so funny :PGirl All The Bad Guys Want8 o'clock Monday night and I'm waitingTo finally talk to a girl a little cooler than meHer name is Nona she's a rocker with a nose ringShe wears a 2-way, but I'm not quite sure what that meansAnd when she walks, all the wind blows and the angels singBut, she doesn't notice meCause she's watching wrestlingCreaming over tough guysListening to rap metalTurntables in her eyesChorusIt's like a bad movie; she's looking through me, if you were me than you'd be,Screaming, \"someone shoot me,\" as I fail miserably,Trying to get the GIRL ALL THE BAD GUYS WANT ...She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent OrangeHer CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dadShe said she'd like to score some refer and a 40ozShe'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never haveAnd when she walks, all the wind blows and the angels singBut, she'll never notice meCause she's watching wrestlingCreaming over tough guysListening to rap metalTurntables in her eyesShe likes them with a mustacheRacetrack season passDriving in a Trans AmDoes a mullet make a man?ChorusThere she goes again with fishnets onAnd dread locks in her hairShe broke my heart I want to be sedatedAll I wanted was to see her nakedNow I'm watching wrestlingTrying to be a tough guyListening to rap metalTurn tables in my eyesI can't grow a mustache and I ain't got no season passAll I got's a mopedChorusCause she's the girl all the bad guys want"
