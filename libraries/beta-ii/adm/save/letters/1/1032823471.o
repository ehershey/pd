__Letter "Apparently the owners of this house had been seeing images and hearingvoices for quite a while. They did some research and found that a ladyonce lived in the house who lost her husband during the civil war. Legendsays that she used to sit at the table and look across the fields inanticipation of her loved one returning home. He never came.  So, they sayshe still waits. They caught this photo of what they claimto be her. This one was wild and a little spooky once you find the ghost inthe picture. It took me a few seconds to find it, but when you do, it juststands out. Like one of those optical illusions.To save you some time, concentrate around the table. Best not to focus toomuch on one spot.Look around the table and toward the window.Click on the link below for the picture. Best to enlarge. For an addedtouch, turn up the volume.  It's faint, but the low murmur you hear waswhat got the photographer's attention first.http://home.attbi.com/~n9ivo/whatswrong.swfApparently the owners of this house had been seeing images and hearingvoices for quite a while.
