__Letter "If you want to give this guy a try go ahead. If he doesn't work out I am done hiring for awhile. I plan on promoting Vian eventually if he keeps his interest up and steadily produces areas. I know he will stick around and will make a decent builder.I am done hiring for awhile unless you find someone worhtwile. Randalar and Loendale just have me frustrated. I deleted both of them today, if they return and can explain what the problem is/was we might reinstate them, who knows. Anyhow, I am now rambling so I will sign off.Stormy"
