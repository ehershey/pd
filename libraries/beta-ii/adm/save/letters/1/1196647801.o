__Letter "I don't understand why a link is needed. I would be willing to do a java telnet for it but a regular link is not going to happen for various reasons including we don't need it. If players want to build we give them the address. Making the address public will just cause problems and confusion among new people who visit the website before trying the mud out, in my opinion.Stormy"
