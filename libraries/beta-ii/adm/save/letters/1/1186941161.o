__Letter "Hi, I made an orc warlock on the server - her name is Adi - couldn'tget Adila.  I tried making that \"i\" like you said, but it wouldn't work.So, I added you to my friends.  What level are you?  You're probablyabout level 70 by now.  How much did you sell your character for?  Must have been a good one.Miss you hubby, hugs, smooches,your Adilaxoxo"
