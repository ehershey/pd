__Letter "Due to people joining AoD to snoop on AoD and some nasty things happening with in AoD, Wraith and i have spoken and agreed that AoD should be no longer linked with Ds.Could you please separate us.  I'm really not sure about procedures and such of owning a guild, so i'm not sure what the protocol is about getting new rooms and items are.Thank youWisp"
