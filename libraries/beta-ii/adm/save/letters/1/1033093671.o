__Letter "Hey you guys.. I just wanted to say I'm really sorry for being a bitch about the whole guild thing.  It's kinda hard for me to get used to having guys help me.. no strings attached.. expeccially after being the one that helped everyone else for so long.I realized that I have been really rude to you guys about stuff and I'm really sorry.. especially to you, Faust.  You were nice enough to add me.. I shoulda just accepted that.  I am trying really hard to accept you guy's help gracefully now.. well.. at least more gracefully :)  I hope I didn't step on any toes.SugarcandyP.S. Joey and Ash.. I'm still going to kill you both :P"
