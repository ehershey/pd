__Letter "Two people at my school are playing PD while I am, assassinblade and siol. I have nothing to do with them and any activity they partake in that is illegal, i had nothing to do with. I even took the step to worn them that what they were doing may be illegal, and I do not wish to lose my character because of people on my network again :)"
