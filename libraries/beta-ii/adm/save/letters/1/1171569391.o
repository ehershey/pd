__Letter "arcanis is in california, and warrick used to be shikamaru.  the reason they're having this problem is b/c they character shared and now it's coming up as them being on warricks IP, when they used to be when it belonged to it's original person.  i just thought you would want to know b/c im sure that helps with thier problem of signing on.. as far as i know they both play seperate now and no longer do anything bad..but that's why warrick came up as part of them.  hope that helps..b/c i knew they would never tell you"
