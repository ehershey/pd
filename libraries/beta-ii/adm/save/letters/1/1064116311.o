__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Crem to Tsuke Sat Sep 20 16:00:06 2003:-----Looks like they have their panties in a twist.  Ive heard on the grapevine that you also tried to PK blind. *Cheers* If your ever in Darwin, then its my shout at the bar.Read the board in the hall as Darksouls are coming up with something bad for all of us members. Im certain that Blind wont let this slip away and will seek to have a war started. Be well and kill as many darksouls as you can without getting killed yourself.The force is with you.Crem Out"
