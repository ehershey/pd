__Letter "The new spell is not purely for RP purposes, it's to help people gain alignment.Many mobs are good, and not very many are evil, and it has causedproblems for some people in the past (myself included, when I played).I don't plan to give up balance to anyone else to completely re-re-vampit anytime soon, so don't worry too much about another 'rotation'.I also am trying very hard to avoid power creep, where every new thingis stronger than the one before it. I set a baseline when I startedand have been doing my best to keep to it. Also, I never purposelymake an entire class/sub weak. There will be a bit of variance -most wanderers should do less damage than a fighter, for instance -but differences in pure damage per time will be made up for with other things.And yes, balance is difficult. I know you fought Tia in the arena justthe other day and said you couldn't do anything. That's all thanks toa single spell that I made just as something to tide sorcs over,and it's not meant to keep you semi-para'd forever like that. I'vetweaked it about 5 times and it's still not right. I won't whingeabout how hard it is (well, except that last sentence), but it takes _time_to get things just right. Currently I am the only person working on balanceand I have a rudimentary 'life' outside of mudding, so it will be quitea while before everything is done being balanced. Just please try to be patient.Try another sub if you get bored of paladins - the new remort lets you saveyour paladin try another sub, and you can use it once a reboot. If you don'twant to, that's fine... maybe come up with some ideas for paladins and post them.One of the first things I do when starting a new sub is go over theirboard for ideas.Anyway, this has gotten rather long. I know things aren't all balanced.I'm working on it. I plan to keep working on it for as long as it takes,because it's _fun_ for me. So, hopefully that will assuage your fears.Nulvect"
