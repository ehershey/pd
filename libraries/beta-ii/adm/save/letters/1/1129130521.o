You may not harass anyone. This means you can't make calls to other   builders, make items that make calls to other builders, mess with    other builders in anyway. 2. This place is for building areas not playing, not researching secrets,   not for hangin out and chating. This is not really a place for fun. If   you want to hang out and talk, play, etc goto the game port. 3. If you do not build something, you will not be allowed to stay. We want   results from the builders port otherwise this place is a wate of our   time and will be taken down. 4. Do not read, copy, or look at other builders work without permission   from that builder. The entire tirun directory is open for you to dig   around in and find examples."
