__Letter "I went into the same room as smite and tauran in Rhondale so that they would use their combo on me, so I could log it and show that the breathe for some dragons needs to be fixed as it is bugged. I couldn't get out of the room or use any commands due to this bug, so I went LD instead. I also didn't want to get into a proper fight as that is against the LAN rules.After that we saw all the 'trash-talking' that Smite and Tauran had been doing over newbie, as well as some abusive IM messages. So I logged on again to ask them to stop being abusive to us. Tauran was still being fairly rude after that so I asked him to come out of the square so I could talk to him properly, as I was using tells with you, Daos, at the time and I didn't want to mix them up.I got a round of idles on him, which is a bug that I thought was fixed way back when the same thing happened with me and Yakko. Tauran left the room, and I was writing out a message to tell him it was a bug and to leave it alone, and he came back into the room even though he couldn't use abilities on me. Once I sent the message to him I left the room so that he wouldn't die, but I was too late and he did anyway.It was really annoying because he made a 'wave' at me in the last round, to show he was doing it deliberately to get me a law thing, or to show I was abusing a bug, or something. And then later he tells me 'bye bye' with a smilie grin.Then, after trying to pk me, he pks a member of our guild. *shrug* - he is really starting to harass now, and I can't even think of why.Except that one time maybe when he had done something to lose his heartbeat, and he thought I was going to dob him in. Which were his words, I didn't say anything except to ask how he did it, since he had known what he was doing. tis all."
