__Letter "I think it would be cool if demons were born with a racial characteristic of having a thick skin, somewhat like dragons have. Increased defense skill and armour rating would result. The demon would probaby have the bonus at level 1 as they still have the same skin, but perhaps it would increase with level too? just a vague idea if you wanna work off of it. I'm not good with details :P"
