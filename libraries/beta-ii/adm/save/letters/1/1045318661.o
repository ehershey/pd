__Letter "I did have an idea that Xyran was warren. but contrary to your beleif im not jealous, as for treating him like dirt, i thought you knew me better than that.As for mudmarried its your life to live, and your reasons are your own you don't have to justify yourself to me.just cause i don't talk to him doesn't mean i have anything against him, but he will be treated like an ordinary player in if he makes an ass of himself i will hate him, and i won't do him any special favours, like eq maybe some but not l33t stuff like you have, but since he's only here to talk to you that shouldn't matter.get angreal from backpackrub angreallike always i just hope your happy unfortuneatly its not with me, but that was my fault so i can't go crying about it.-Gabriel"
