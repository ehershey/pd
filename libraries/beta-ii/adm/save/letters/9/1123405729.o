__Letter "From what I was told, leveling...then going to the \"old man\" inside the \"Old, run down house\" within tirun square, and typing \"kill monster\" then letting idle rounds hit the monster in order to up your skills.  Not only was he doing this, but he also admited to Daos, that he had a timer set up to \"kill monster\" every 5 mins.This sounds a lot like cheating and scripting to me.Just thought you should know.Carina"
