__Letter "Just to let you know, I mailed in the descript to the two new rooms.....I don't know how long it will take for wraith to hop on it.  But just wanted to let you know that I'm not just sitting on my rear end doing nothing  :P  After we pay for that, we'll see what it will take to get the two \"houses\" put in.  Do you like Azire's names to call them or shall we keep looking?  I think after we get the houses put in, we'll have a vote who goes into council.  I think three is a nice healthy number, it covers all the basis.  right now it stands:Teflon and Daboura for protectionAzire for SpiritPyro for the third house.......we should get two more people, so it will be two per council.  Any sugguestions?Starting on monday, I'm going to try and split my time between coding and mudding.  I really should get phase one of my area done, so I can continue with it.  Well, that's about it for now."
