__Letter "What it looks like to me is this, you baited him, he baited you, and bothof you got what they wanted. You can never win an argument with an admin,not a public one anyways. I refuse to let myself get in that game. You never play on Merentha anyway, so it's no loss to you. Pet lostan interesting player that made the mud more interesting, his lossnot yours. But Merentha did lose because they won't see you around.Both, your friends and your enemies lose, because both loved to loveyou or loved to hate you. So it's a lose, lose, win, win, lose situation :PGiam"
