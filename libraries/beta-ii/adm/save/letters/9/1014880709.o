__Letter "The treasury is gaudily decorated with trophys won in battle.  Severed heads of monsters from faraway lands line the walls.  On the far wall lies the head of an enormous black dragon, though dead its ferocity it portrayed in life still echos in its glazed eyes.  There is an obsidian plaque near the head with golden lettering inscribed upon it.  (look plaque) \"The Treasury of the Forsaken\" list treasury commands."
