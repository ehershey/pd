__Letter "hey joshhope u had a good day. Sorry to hear that you were upset about school. I wanted to let you know that I might not be able to talk to you until very late. My mom gave me a lecture saying that I do homework first, then help her, then have fun. I’m filled with joy. You can tell.Sorry if I was being a brat yesterday. I just really hate not knowing things, but I guess I better get used to it. *sighs* but you have to tell me one day, and don’t just say you would never do it. grrrSorry again if I quit to fast, my mom came and I got caught again! Twice in one day. Jesu christo I better get professional lessons on how to be sneakier. But I think my punishment just increased so *crosses her fingers and hopes it aint so*Well I gotta go now but I will try to talk to you later.*hugs*simran"
