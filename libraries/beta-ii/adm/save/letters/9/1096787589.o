__Letter "A magic carpet, similar to DW eggs.. flies you placesFor out oil you get a lamprub lamp - As you rub the lamp the genie appears and grants your wish for healingThe genies wish is granted and your body is revived!something along those lines anywaysfor stones i got a better ideaa bag that you put stones in.. you can use all the stones while they're inside the bag, that way there's no spam on your item screen and ya dont gotta pull one out every time one diesor it could be one superstone that lasts as long as 20 stones and just costs a bit moreCursed Jewell jewelThis dark cracked jewel seems almost transparent with a dark cloud of purple smoke swirling around inside of it. Your soul tells you to <embrace curse> and regenerate your mana energy.embrace jewelerm embrace curseThe smoke from the jewel leaks out and seeps into your pores, your veins bulge out and your eyes glow as your soul is strengthed once againBOOYAKASHAAlso I want a mob that backstabs people guarding our entrance! if they try to get in, anyways"
