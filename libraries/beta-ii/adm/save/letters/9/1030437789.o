__Letter "Ok, this is *REALLY* giving me the s**ts now. Ashram tried to pk me earlier. Fortunately for me, I know how joy-joy he gets over pk, I knew the instant Lac died that Ashram pk'd him, and I was right. I KNEW the instant he entered he was gonna pk me, just 10 minutes after Lac. He really seems to like making people suffer. Anyway, enough about him, on to the real issue.Role-play.Lots of people go on about how they like to role-play, which is good. I have seen it advertised that PD is supposed to be a role-playing mud, which isn't entirely accurate. See, where role-playing is MOST important, it seems to be MOST lacking. - Archangels and Demons. Archangels moreover though.First, I will get to the point. Archangels have pk'd and tried to pk other archangels. Archangels have played an evil character, despite being a holy race and class. They even say they are role-playing, despite playing evil-angels.I am especially annoyed by the fact that Ashram openly states that he plays an evil character, and here he is The Evil Archangel Cleric of Darksouls. This is also annoying, archangels  in Evil guilds. Soulfly from Army of Darkness. Hermes from AoD as well. But Hermes is Good-aligned. %^CYAN%^*** %^BOLD%^WHITE%^Prator %^RESET%^CYAN%^***As archangels we lose the use of our halo's and wings if our alignment goes too low. yet killing an Archangel with a max alignment (1500?) means nothing.So here are my ideas: Archangels can't attack each other, or, if they kill another archangel, instant loss of wings (sever the limb) and halo, alignment set to Satanic, and unable to ascend' at the bell tower in lodos. To me this still seems too light a punishment from a role-play perspective, I would go so far as to make them human as well. After all, demons now are fallen angels, those that betrayed their brethren.Same goes for demons. Asmodeus punishes them for their foolishness.Taking the role-play a bit further - Archangels and Demons, being the embodiment of their respective alignments, feel obligated to punish those who oppose them (related to Holy war). These pk's don't make you lose exp, just as archangel vs. Demon wouldn't. Holy War would be much more active if we didn't lose so much exp from it.Another idea, archangels and demons can attack each other in safe zones with their race spells/abilities. This would still be ok, since you can go to your guild hall or race hall if you want to be idle. After all spin halo isn't difficult to do."
