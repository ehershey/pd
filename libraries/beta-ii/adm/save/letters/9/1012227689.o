__Letter "Got some more mage things you might want to look at. Gromph is a lvl 20 (or so he told me) and is killin in the temple. he said he can take  one of those mobs down in 6 to 8 rounds.Also had a report on Balkoth from Gromph that balkoth is lvl 21 and can take them down sooner then that.Just lookin out for possible overpowered stuff for yall."
