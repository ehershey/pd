__Letter "Greetings Lord Escobar.I have heard many a tail of your deeds. And I am good friends with your Lieutenant Freddie. Recently I have been attacked and violated by the one they call Geddoe. Vorticon at the moment is still a young group, and we're unable to safely attempt to return the favor. Perhaps you and Freddie could 'speak' with Geddoe? It would certainly make the ties between our guilds stronger."
