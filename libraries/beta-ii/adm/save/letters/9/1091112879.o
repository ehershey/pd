__Letter "k, i understand about david, but that wasn't the point of my mail.the point was about Our friendship. And i said the ball was in your court.so, do you want me to still be your friend, where i can greet you when you come on, and look forward to you company for many logins to come, or not?would you prefer if i stopped trying to talk to you (that would include talking to daboura except about coding issues as well now)?and you shouldn't be afraid of people having feelings for you. what you should do is make yourself clear on what you do and do not want from them having feelings for you. but once again, i'm giving advice, so i'm just going to shut up now, and wait until you get back from work or sleep and reply.i hate losing friends as much as you do jenna, so please, don't let me lose you as a friend.Carmen."
