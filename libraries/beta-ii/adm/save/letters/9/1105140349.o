__Letter "As a guild leader, Bellos needs a certain amount of automatic respect which I don't think he is getting from you.  The threats are following your disrespect for his authority.  In Unholy, the rules are clear: (to name a few) openly respect Asmodeus, openly respect the command structure, and finally defy good at every opportunity that does not violate the first two.  If you don't believe in Asmodeus or you think Bellos is a piece of shit, then by all means feel that way.  But as a member of Unholy, one should express themselves differently, even if this is just an illusion.  For Unholy to be the well lubricated machine that I need it to be, there has to be a command structure, preferably maintained by respect, but by fear if necessary.  Death or physical punishment should be more appealing than rejection or demotion in Unholy.  That's the way I want it to be.  As for your idea about members responding to threats in order to ascend the hierarchy...  well, what threats?  Currently we haven't met any. I like your suggestion.  It would work well on a MUD with more players where the guild members actually have something to prove.Q"
