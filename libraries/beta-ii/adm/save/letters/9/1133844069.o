__Letter "ok, so i like the fact that we can see who is throwing them at us, but what about the cloaked rogues? I signed onto my rogue to test if it said \"A shadow\" or \"angelic\" and it said \"A shadow\" we should be able to see, even if it is a cloakded rogue, who is throwing it at us, to show you the proof of the test, the next mudmail will do so.thanks,Carina"
