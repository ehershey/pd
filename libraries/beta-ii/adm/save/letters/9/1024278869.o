__Letter "Shrubs with purple brerries line the path.Different Shrubs and bushes grow along the Path.The trees here seem to touch the sky.Bird can be heard singing in the distance.Animals roam the forest hunting for food.Small animals run up the tree trunks.Bees buzz around, collecting pollen from the pretty flowers.Dandiloin seeds float gracefully with the breeze.Tall tuffed grasses grow amongst the tall trees.Wisp"
