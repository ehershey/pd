__Letter "You tell Scrata: is there anything i can help you with?Scrata replies: I believe so. I have strong reason to believe, unless it was agenuine offer, that there are people impersonating PD admins in attempts toco-erce coders/builders of other MUCK's to \"sell\" code and/or rooms items etc.You reply to Scrata: i greatly doubt that it is a genuine offerYou reply to Scrata: do you know what mud or muck?You reply to Scrata: i know the Admins frown greatly upon thatScrata replies: I'm a builder on another MUD, and one MUCK, and I do extensiveASCII art as part of my areas. This is no secret I post examples and ask forfeedback on the MUD/MUCK, and I'm mostly a builder rather then a player thesedays. However, I received a letter claiming to be from an unspecified PD admin,saying that PD is desperate for new areas and that \"enhanced characters\"including quest classes and/or subclasses would be payment.Scrata replies: In reply to your question, I received the e-mail to my e-mailaccount, so I am completely unsure as to what material they are trying toobtain I am a staffer (equivilant to a builder) on Crossroads MUCK vitani.daemon.sh 9999  and a builder at Merentha MUD  mud.merentha.com 10000(although the builders port has a different port address)Scrata replies: Via e-mail, which is strange. I have made it my policy to stopgiving out my e-mail address, since several months ago, where I was harassed byplayers of Merentha Mud.Scrata replies: I was just logging on to inform the Admins that someone isimpersonating them, and perhaps encouraging people to give up their code.Unless it is genuine, of course, in which case I am replying to say that noneof my code for any place is for sale, trade, or otherwise.Scrata replies: The e-mail was a hotmail one, I remember that much. I'm tryingto track it now, it's kinda gotten lost in my spam...You reply to Scrata: i doubt any of the admins would contact you with a hotmailaddressScrata replies: Ah, found it: pd_stormbringer@hotmail.comScrata replies: Who is Stormy?Scrata replies: Stormbringer, I assume?Scrata replies: That's who claimed to be the author of the letter.There was some stuff after that, i told him to mudmail you but he said he didn't know the mudsystem hereI just thought you should knowWisp"
