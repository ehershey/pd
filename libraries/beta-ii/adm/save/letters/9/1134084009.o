__Letter "TrooperWhy do you steal the Boondock Saints theme? I think that movie was cool but youstole their end-of-the-movie-super-cool-quote-thing.Mewell, to steal means that you take something and use it as your own.Which is not what I did, thank you.  If one uses \" \"'s that automatically showsthat It is something stated from a movie, or a book, or something or other.Learn your definitions, before you speak ignorantly.mmkthanksTrooperIgnorant? I dont care if you put quotes, you still jacked it from a movie totry and make your guild look cool.Btw furiae, it wasnt that great.But carinas mom was.At poker."
