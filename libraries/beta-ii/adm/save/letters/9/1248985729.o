__Letter "Hey Nul,I guess this could either be considered a question or an idea.  Was thinking bout Liches and was thinking about them having an ability to attack an enemy and borrow/steal one of their more powerful attributes and temporarily adding it to thier own stats.ETC, Lich leeches off a warrior/fighter taking away a portion of their total hp/con, adding it to his total con/ hp or going to a mage leechin his int or a clergy leeching his wis, wanderers may be more charisma and rogues be dex.  Eventually it would have to wear off but that'd be totally up to you man, lemme know what you think bro-- Yang wants a Lich"
