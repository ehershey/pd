__Letter "Seems I keep missing ya. I hope all is well. I'vebeen working on my book this week. The one about Christianity and how religion is a lot like a science with all the rules and equations almost and such. Nothing else much going on. Work's fine. Hope all is well in your world. Say hi to the hubby for me and see ya around. :)James"
