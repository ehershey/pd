__Letter "THank you bud :)I'm also going to be taking an added security measure for newcharacters there. The login.c will dump them into an empty roomwith no exits and a board to post their requests to me for abuilder. The only way out will be for me to xmote them and/ora builder to grant the character guest access and trans them.This will prevent someone from coming over and annoying ourbuilders while they are trying to work :)Not that they can go walking around in projects anyway with mysecurity system active *cackle*Any areas you wish to have blocked can be added into thebuilder_move_test()->\"/adm/simul_efun/security_screen.c\"This function controls where and how people can be movingaround over there on builders.Ironman"
