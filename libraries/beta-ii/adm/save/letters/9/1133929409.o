__Letter "hey, whit is going to put one in our guild soon, but this is a post daboura made for us all to read:This weekend, unless something comes up, I will be instatuting a membership capon all guilds. So you may be asking yourself, how will this affect me and myguild? Well the answer to that is quiet simple. If you happen to have over theallowed number of people already in your guild, than you will not be able toinduct anyone, but you will not be required to remove anyone untill you decidethat you want to add someone.Now the next question you may ask is, why are you doing this? Well, this isanother simple answer, I don't think guilds should be based of how many peopleare in it, but rather, how good the people are that are in it. By capping guildmembership, guilds will hopefully become a more exclusive thing, and I'm hopingit will motivate players to be better in order to be considered for membership.Ok, 2 more things.With the caps, and an exlusive feel for the guilds, I am intending on makingsure there are things that guilds can have in order to seperate themselves fromthe general player population. Obviously nothing as crazy as the things I justremoved from all of your halls, save for the scry rooms, I'm still on the fenceabout those, but anyway.... I need ideas from you guys. I want to know if youguys have any ideas about rooms or items that can be added to guilds that willseperate, but not make it such a big difference that players will think theyneed to be in a guild to make it.And for my final thought, I'm not sure what the cap is going to be yet, I'mbatting around a few numbers in my head, but I'm not sure about any of themyet. I'm trying to keep the current player population, plus the number ofguilds in mind. So if any of you have a suggestion and a reasoning for acertain number cap, please post it.-Daboura"
