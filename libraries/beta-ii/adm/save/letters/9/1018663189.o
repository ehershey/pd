__Letter "I'd just noticed that wanderers seem to really suckright now. I'm not placing blame, I know coding isa lot of work. But if you need someone to help withwanderers (or other class abilities) I'd be glad to.Class development is so much more interesting thanmaking more areas.Just thought I'd offer in case you're short oncoders. I know some muds where the admin insiststhat he does all the work himself and nothing getsdone....-Calirynth"
