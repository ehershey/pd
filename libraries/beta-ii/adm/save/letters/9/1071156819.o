__Letter "Deeper into the cave, thoughts of turning back enter the mind.  The tight passages and jagged rocks deliver unforgiving bruises to the the unaccustomed traveller.  Only those adept at navigating the sharp twists and turns of the cave are able to come out unscathed.  The sounds of pick axes and shovels echo from deeper within the cave followed by the grunts and groans of the goblins and dwarves mining the jewel-rich cavern walls.  Curiosity is accented only by a strong fear as the oppressing smell of rottening flesh and bones, left over by past meals, mingles with the heavy humidity, screaming in the travellers mind that now is the time to turn back... before it's too late.sugar"
