__Letter "Thanks...  *hug*  Yeah, I'm not so sure I'll be able to visit over break, anyway...  I havent received any money for a car, and heath is planning on going camping over break, so I may not have a way to drive to MN.  I'll try to find some way...  but right now it's not looking too great.  *chuckles*  I dont mean to make light of Alex's wanting to be with you and all...  but you do have that effect *wink*  Good luck with your project, I'll catch ya later.*smooch*              -Paul"
