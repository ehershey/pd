__Letter "Baby, do you think that messes with me, that sometimes I don't get to talk to you? Well it doesn't. I mean, sure, the want to talk to you is there and always will be, but you're not feeling good, I understand :). You take the time off that you need to recover and to get better :). If it gets too much worse I dunno what to tell you though :( I've never heard of that inflammation thingy :(, I don't even know if it's curable. I think they can give you a shot near your butt to heal it, but that just sounds painful, hehe. I do miss you and your beautiful voice, but I do know and understand why you're not online a lot :). I love you with all my heart and soul, and I might be going to take another nap, didn't get a lot of sleep :(."
