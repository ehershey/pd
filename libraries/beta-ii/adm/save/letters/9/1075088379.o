__Letter "Just out of curiousity, repeatively killing in the monster over abudant caverns would be bug abuse wouldn't it with pretty much infinite mobs and 40 mobs per room and such? Aziraphale seems to be doing it alot is all maybe he is just standing in the caverns all day but i doubt that which also leads me to believe that he might be scripting in there but well either way, he or anyone else shouldn't be repeatively, constantly killing in their all day should they? *shrug*and just out of curiousity with all these new updates of spells are any of them being changed at all or even their damage changed or something or are they just being updated for the new system? :)"
