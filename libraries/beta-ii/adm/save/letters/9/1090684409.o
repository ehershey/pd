__Letter "I know you're currently busy with stuff, but I really think these 'Tainted Swords' need to be reviewed. They have around same weapon class at dragonslayers, specials just as often as dslayers and available to HM members of forsaken.The problem i have with these swords are their specials. Which gives the user back huge amounts of hp and sp. Not to mention it gives cyan destroy utterlies.So with these swords in the game, forsaken fighter members have dramatically improved their exp rate, eg. Eios can exp without using oils and ointments all he needs to do is rush, and the specials will heal him to full hp, sp in 1 round.I have spoke to Eios about these bugged swords, he acknowledges they're cheap, but he will continue to use em as long as the administration don't take any action to forbid the use of a game altering weapon.The guild items forsaken has right now are far from fair, I'm personally cheesed off because I'm a berserker, and I chose berserker because we can exp fast with rage with the expense of defense. However with these 'Tainted Swords' normal raknid warriors like Lac can exp without oil ointment at twice the speed of a raknid berserker such as blitz.Please consider reviewing their items soon, or else all the forsaken fighters will have had a tremendous amount of unfair headstart compared to the rest of us."
