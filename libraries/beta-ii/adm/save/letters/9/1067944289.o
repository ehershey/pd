__Letter "Hello, i have completed the Rhondale quest and i was given a coin. i wanted to keep it untill my stats were abit higher before i used it. but i died trying to kill a monster and now i cannot use the ring. I am wondering why and it would be real good if i could use it since i got nothing from the quest besides the coin.thanks you for taking your time to read thisGaldur"
