__Letter "When i use my spells (hellfire/vortex/demonfire) I dont get the disease damage.It registers disease as me casting a spell every round. As such it isnt a help.The lower damage in the last mail was assuming i could do other things as well (demonfire,hellfire). If you can set it so the mob gets hit for the damage in a way that doesnt count as me casting a spell it would fix disease.Thx for the new spell btw. i love it :)"
