__Letter "Last time I read the rules I could've swore that player sharing was illegal. I know for fact (though I do not have the proof) that Rommel and Tychus are the same person irl. Kaotic, Rommel, Warrick, Tychus, Altair are somehow player sharing. I would like this mudmail to remain anonymous please. "
