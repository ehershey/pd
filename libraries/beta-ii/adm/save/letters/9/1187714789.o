__Letter "I know this is most likely a review for most. You might find somenew information in the tutorials i have coded so far on builders.Please look over the following directories;/doc/coding/adm/doc/codingOne of the things that some people might not know about are thequalifiers and how they function. You will find those tutorialsin the /adm/doc/coding folder. I dont think its a good idea forme to let builders know my methods for securing things on the portso i put that info in the adm dir :)Ironman"
