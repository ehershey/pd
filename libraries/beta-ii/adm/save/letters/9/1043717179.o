__Letter "A vision of angelic innocence, wildsilk's slightly arched eyebrows and high cheekbones which hollow into deep dimples as she smiles, meld into a light dusting of sunkisses which dance lightly across her purt nose. Cascades of silky soft blond curls tumble loosely down this young woman's back, over her shoulders and breasts, down to her waist. Soft sparkles shimmer off the highlights like the sunlight off a lake. Big green eyes, framed by thick, long eyelashes which are brought to life with a light coating of mascara, move coyly around the room, absorbing every thing she sees. Ranging in colour from a light leaf green to the dark murky grey green of hailstorm clouds, her eyes can change with her mood. Her straight white teeth can be noticed between her full, soft, partially opened, dusky pink lips which curve upwards slightly in a natural smile.         Standing about 5'4\", she isn't the tallest of women though she seems taller as she stands or kneels, proud and straight. Her soft skin compliments her well-developed curves and toned limbs. Attached to her creamy neck is a leather leash with a clasp at one end that wraps around her neck and secures back onto itself creating a practical collar and leash. A soft, yellow, flowing cheesecloth dress, covers her body lightly, the neckline flows up from her breasts and wraps around her throat like a collar, leaving her back bare, a soft colour change can be noticed around her nipples through the soft, airy material. The cut of the dress hugs to her curves, the skirt flowing lightly to her firm calves caressing them in the light breeze. As she walks, a mid thigh split can be noticed up both side, revealing her tanned legs. On her back are two large bruising welts, the third stands out more as a deep wound in her soft skin.  Her feet are relatively small, and delicate, with well defined arches from wearing Ballerina Boots, though usually she is bare foot."
