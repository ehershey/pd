__Letter "    Cleave is a towering 3.2 meters tall, and roughly the same    wide.  She has four arms, and four legs and a desire to kill.     She has been known to hunt the planet for evil to befriend,    and holiness to destroy.  This is not the type of creature you    want to cross paths with, as if she is having a bad day, you    wont be around long enough to scream in fear.  Cleave is fond    of currency, you can buy her pity for large amounts of gold or    platinum.  Cleave is an Illuminati member, and she will    destroy any who disrespect her, or her clan.its in my finger info and my description now, is this okay?"
