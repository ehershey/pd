__Letter "I've noticed a few things hereThe waxes dont seem to be causing much of a problem...  I looked at your logs and although it *says* waxes were lost, the before and after autoload arrays are the same.  One thing I have noticed is this...  lac had a special item that hermes had made for him.  He almost always lost it.  I did a grep of his autoload file and the item never showed up.  So it looks like items are being left out before the log takes place.  I stepped through the code and didnt see anything, but I thought you might catch something I missed.  Thanks for the help with the logger.                    -Nightshade"
