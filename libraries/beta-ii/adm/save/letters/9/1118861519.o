__Letter "This is all I know what happened:The first time Dubbya got his character restored was a little while ago, he decided to remort to demoon with a different class/subclass.  Well, as it turns out, he didnt care for it, so I dont know who did it, but he got his old character put back (Demon/fighter/anitpaladin).  Then One week (a week or 2 ago) he decides he is quitting PD, even gives his guild AoD up and then suicides his characters, Except one....Logaine (that I know).  So then a couple days after that he decides he misses PD and then remakes his characters, all the ones he suicided.  Then he goes and begs and pleads again to get at least Duddya put back to Demon, Fighter, Antipaladin again.  BUT put back the way he was before he quit the first time...lvl 65 with the same stats and skills and all (from what I understand).  And then he goes and brags about it and says sometimes life isnt fair blah blah.It isn't fair to get what he got.  He suicided his charachters, I have done it before too, but I was under the impression that it was NOT ok to try and get them put back by an admin.  That is messed up in my opinon, and cheating.So that is what I know.Thank youCarina"
