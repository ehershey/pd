__Letter "I was just giving them a heads-up as to why my area got delayed.I just let them have a general idea about it :) No details at allwere given other than a brief summary. I would post anything elseabout it until your ready to implement it.I would like to post a request for 2 builders to experiment withit once all the bugs are out of the system. It would be on theconstruction board here on the main and wiz board on builders.Only thing i have to finish playing with is the use of functionpointers by the actual commands. It works but has slight bug igotta get out of the commands there. I should have it debuggedby the weekend.It's working perfectly with strings tho :) I just want it to workfor function pointers too for us.I might need to ask whit or nulvect to help me debug it if it'sok with you.Ironman"
