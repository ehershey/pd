__Letter "I'm sure Scamp will be whinning to you that he got PKed by me so let me tell you what happened. This should all be able to be confirmed in logs.I logged off Vyce and onto Rhuan for the purpose of cloaking to wait hoping either Plague or Ironman would step outside of a safe zone.Within a minute of my logging on Arcanis (A guild mate) asks me for a favor so I say sure.He says Scamp is cloaked in tenebrae throne room, and Arcanis wants me to kill him. I say fine, and I kill him.Scamp I'm sure will whine and complain that I broke rules (he's doing it over newbie now). No rule was broken. I didn't log on for the purpose of PKing. I didnt even know where he was or that he was on (he was cloaked) until Arcanis told me over Darksoul line. I haven't PKed anyone in 6 days and never have killed Scamp before. I'm not aware if he has any alts I have killed but even if he does it couldnt have been within a week.Anyways just wanted to tell you what happened as I'm guessing he'll be crying to you shortly.I hope your semester is going well at school.Thanks,-- Rhuan"
