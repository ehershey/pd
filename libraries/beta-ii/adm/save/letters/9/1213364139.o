__Letter "come chat with me when you see me on next.I have a few details i would like to discuss with ya so i can finishthe rough sketch here. Got a working model for the mappings. I justgotta code all the functions to control the flow of data into and outof the system.One major question for you tho. Would you like for this system topermit immortals and higher to mail files back and forth too ? I meanuploading any file they have write access to and mail it off to someoneelse. They would also be able to download their mails INTO files forpernament archiving if they wish. Only immortals would have this partof the system. I'm also setting it up so that flags will be settableon the mails like private, emergency, urgent, guild, class/preclass, etc.The private flag would disable the ability of the recipiant to fowardthe mail to others. This would of course be disabled for immortals.Ironman"
