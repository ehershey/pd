__Letter "Hey gorgeous. :) Just wanted to say hi. I got off work an hourlate this morning. I was almost about to leave my area when three students came in worried about their friend. He had beencutting himself. We eventually track the student down, he is argumentative and stuff and hiding his injuries. When the policeand ambulance folks come, we see the wounds and they take him toget checked out despite his wishes. So, it was a mess. I dunnowhat any of this should mean to you, but I guess I just wantedto tell you about my day. :) Also, I was thinking of you. Stillthinking of you and when I get off the computer, I'll still bethinking of you. :) Stay safe and everything. I hope to catchyou early before I have to help my niece move out of the dorm.Take care, sweetest of sweet ladies.Love,James"
