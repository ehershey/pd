__Letter "I have it working on my MudLib ive been working on, but I know how to make it random what welcome message they get when they connect to the mud.  It will simply work that everything in /news/welcome might come up as a welcome screen.  It should be simple enough to do as well.  I will have to make some minor changes to the Login, but it shouldnt mess with Player life.  Just a thought.Whit"
