While they go through the area, they are seriously going to think that they are going to die, but they have to be brave enough to try it anyway. To keep the players from getting reckless and just taking the dangerous route each time, I also want to throw in some things that will genuinely kill the player. The key will be in the little hints we give them, telling them what they have to do in order to continue. The danger is in going forward and not backwards, the player will have an item which they can use when they chicken out which will bring them back to the first room.The players will have to go at it alone, I can guarantee to you that there will be nobody helping them, even if they are doing it at the same time, so we can throw in some unique challenges in there. The area will be destroyed when the player leaves, so we can't make them leave anything behind unless they know that it will be gone forever. These are the ideas I've had so far:There will be a disembodied voice that will help the player along as they go. It's not there to help them by giving them hints unless they would really need the hint. The voice will be the source of the hints that we won't be able to get across by room descriptions alone. Near the beginning, the voice will warn the player about material obsession and so on. A few rooms later, there will be a very unstable bridge. The bridge takes 10 seconds to cross. The player just has to type the direction once to start crossing, but they can turn back at any time during the crossing process. At 6 seconds, if their inventory has more than 4 items in it, they will be killed. For the 6 seconds prior, they will be strongly cautioned about having too much in their inventory, and how they should turn back, should they have a lethal amount of items in their inventory. I don't expect the players to take me seriously at first, so I may give them two chances -- whenever they die the first time, their guide will compliment them on their bravery but remind them that there is a fine line between bravery and foolishness, and they will have only 1 hp. After that, the next time they would have died, they will die.For the final boss of the area, in the last room, I was planning on having a level 1000 monster. The monster will have 1 for each of his stats and skills however, so he will die in one tap. If you consider the monster, it tells you that he would beat the shit out of you, but if you're brave enough to attack him then he'll die.The second thing I need help with is coming up with the rewards for my two mini-events. For the ogre king, I want a really neat item, something that may not be especially useful, but which does a really unique thing or really unique things, something which is not replacable. A kind of thing an ogre king may have as a toy. For the quest of bravery I'm not sure what I would do,do you think I can get an item that will override any alignment checks, so clerics can cast the spell they can only use against evil monsters, that kind of thing."
