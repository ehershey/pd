__Letter "I was thinking today... maybe the balance formula needs work? I think that moves which are rank 1 should suck (and suck pretty much forever), rank 2 should be sorta ok for a level 15/25, rank 3 should be great for 35/50, rank 4 should be absolutely awesome for 50+... basically- I think that rank 1 and 2 abilities need to be nerfed, whereas rank 3 and 4 abilities need to buffed up a fair amount."
