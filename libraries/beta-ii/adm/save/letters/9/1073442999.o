__Letter "One more thing on the sword... see if you can't up the weaponclass of the darknesses by one if you can, and if not... add fire elemental damage to it. Elemental damage is something that's in the game, but people haven't really gotten into it yet. Maybe when the sword specials, the damage could be fire based, as well as getting the sp and occasional para. Instead of just sp and normal damage, and occasional para.so yea... bye bye againCookie"
