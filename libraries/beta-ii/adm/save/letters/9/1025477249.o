__Letter "hey hey. just thought i'd let you know some balance stuff that i've noticed lately. overall everything is really really balanced now but there are a few weak spots.1) Any large sp using ability and boost. This is really raknid paladin/antipaladin and blue dragons (flameclaw). it allows them to do insane damage with no drawbacks because they dont use oil. with quad slash the damage is huge but it is made up for with the time spent using oils. when these classes can boost they can slash till they have 0 sp and then get full sp in one round with boost. effectively it makes them exp over 100% faster than if they didnt have boost. This will be especially true of blue dragons once there are some big enough. my recommendation is taking boost away from these classes or taking away their high damage move. a blue dragon with breath can still do 400 damage at lvl 30 which is much more than any normal class and it paras. this would be fair as it is a quest race after all. paladin and antipaladin i would recommend taking out slash. this would make fighters more diverse because right now fighters are all similar. paladins could get 6 blunt and use maul (very strong at high levels)sprinkle ashesand antipaladins could get 6 projectile and use impale (similar damage to maul but a little more). This would make these classes balanced and help move people away from raknid only fighters. raknid has a bonus of 2 normal hits (100+ damage per round at lvl 50) and their slash is only balanced due to high sp cost. Paladin/antipaladin would then be equivelent to those classes who cannot boost and are already balanced. same is true for blue dragons.2) stasis. This spell is very prone to abuse. a necro can raise a spectre and have it attack a player and stasis. any mage/clergy will be killed by this and even as a lvl 30 raknid ranger i was killed like this in arena. Stasis lasts an emtreemly long time and there is no defense against this. Also a fighter and stasis class can pk anyone with ease and again there is no defense as stasis lasts for over a minute. i would recommend removing the spell altogether or making it so abilities/spells cannot be used but a person can still leave the room.3) Assassins. Backstab is good with the 1 round delay after it but the damage is very very high right now (5 str = 100 damage). A lvl 30 backstabbed me for 850 damage in arena and yakko has hit for 1.7k. i would recommend a 10% reduction in backstab damage because their stab is equal to a slash and circle is equal to a quad slash just about. the sp costs of stab/circle make them fair, but in addition to backstab they can do too much damage too fast.4) disease. 1 disease will make any limb fall of a mob from sewers levels 1-3. dunno if it works at other places as well.Those are the big balance issues i've noticed. each class seems to have its ups and downs now and i think its working out great. thanks for all you've done stormy :) this place is the best!!-- Ash"
