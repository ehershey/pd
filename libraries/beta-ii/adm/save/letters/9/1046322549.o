__Letter "They probally wont work.  I will have to do alot of work to get them.  Since there is no use for them, im not gonna add them yet.  Also, Players will be able to customize the describe of there ship.  To keep em sensible, Ive added a thing that will check for bad words in a describe.  Also, I dont think its a good idea to be able to upgrade your ship at the same place as you buy your boat.  I was thinking making a shack near Helgrath and putting the ship upgrade seller there.Whit"
