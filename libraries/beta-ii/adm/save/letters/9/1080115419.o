__Letter "buffer meHows it going.just looking at the lower level side of abils and spells from this play test. and by my thinkings all lower level chars are pretty well off :Pbuffer mei think maybe because most of the feed back was done by lvl 50 +'s that is why lvl 20's and below are very powerfulat level 10 you can kill 20k mobs in about 11ish rounds with missile as a mage, you use alot of oil because the monster bends you but you can kill them quick enough to get to lvl 20 in about 3 hours play time :Pjust some more feed back that you may want to look into the lower end of things.Thanks, Gromph."
