__Letter "i just got 'soulburn' as a final spell, really dissapointed in it, its extreemly weak.seems weaker than deathtouch which is like a lvl 30 spelli'd like if you might consider beefing this one up, it seemsvery unbalanced.ps. I wrote a valentine for kumi on the 14th, but she lost it whenthe server crashed today, any chance it could be remade? it just saidi love you insideThanks,Brian"
