__Letter "How would you like to have another demon in your guild?Artanis is in a pickle because his guild is good natured and all that, but he went demon.Demons dont have the ability for both good and evil, as archangels do, so he will need to leave his guild and transfer to another. He has said that he will only do that if another guild OFFERS to take him in.Would you do that favor for artanis so he isnt riddled with questions as to why is is in a good natured guild all the time?Thanks,Wraith"
