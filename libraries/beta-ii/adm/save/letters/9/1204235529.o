__Letter "Hi, it's funny getting emails about real life stuff on all these alts.Problem is we don't catch up to them until we log into the alts, whichcould be days.Maybe we should have one alt to send/receive emails from.I will just email you everything from Rayna and you can let me knowwhich one you will want me to send things to.Miss you,hugsxoxo"
