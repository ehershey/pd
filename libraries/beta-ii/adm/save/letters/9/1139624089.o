__Letter "Ok I have a small 4 room area built to be the guild hall. heres a small map[]-[]-[]   []now the left room on top is bow.c. Now I have the room built, I have the guild oils and stones coded(though they dont actually  heal yet) and I have the mob they the guild members will be 'buying' the items from. The problem is I have no idea have to bring everything together soto speak.Now the center room galley.c doesnt really have a purpose anymore but I'd still like it if possible. and the right room, stern.c was actually goin to be the 'locker' room. I dont know if you still allow that or not but it can't hurt to ask eh?Now the bottom room hold.c(all of these files in gobs room folder on builders of course) is where the treasury was supposed to go.Now I realize this is kinda of alot of work I'm asking for and if you cant thats fine but I figure I'll mail you these details and we can see what we can work from there.Gob."
