__Letter "Okey lets start with this, I have never once killed soulfly or any of his alts. Where as he has kill Artanis 3 times, he has kill prometheus 1 (3 days ago)Now he killed Me Abzigal, For no reason, just becuase i was artanis at one stage on this mud. I believe i had promethues dested for \"only attacking\" joey after he killed my alt, I understand that.But Ancalagon killed me 3 days after he killed prometheus, I believe having every character i have killed by soulfly and his alts is harrassment big time.He killed prometheus with soulfly then 3 days later killed this character with ancalagon, Un provoked, This is too much, he has to suffer the consequences of harrassment."
