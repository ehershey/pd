__Letter "hmmm, i dont recall very saying i wasnt going to speak to any of you again, if fact i said the opposite, read my last mail agian ;)i left for a few different reasons, i might explain it better one day but not just yet.by the way, before you go blaming all this on Illisse, she isnt the only person i have been talking to over the last few months, ive been getting stories from all over the place, remember there is always more than 1 side to a story and if im going to make a decision about it i need to hear as many different versions as possible.if feel a good leader takes all sides into account before passing judgment so thats what i was trying to do.Anyways enough of that for nowim not going to rejoin Ill any time soon but i will ask you to reinduct my chars so i can get my money from the guild bank, i forgot to withdraw it lolParanoia, Penance and balgar pls :)Anyway talk to you later babe, good luck with it allParanoia - Heavens lone Warrior."
