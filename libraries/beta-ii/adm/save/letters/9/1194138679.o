__Letter "A poem for you my love:I kept my head up high, and then you came my way.I have been hurt so many times.My heart filled with so much pain.But now that pain has gone away.For I have found a place I want to be.This place I see is with thee.For in your arms I have felt and seen,A wonderful feeling that I cannot believe.A safe haven in your arms just for me.Now I give my heart to thee.For my heart believes in you.by Stewart Bradshaw (My Heart Believes in You)."
