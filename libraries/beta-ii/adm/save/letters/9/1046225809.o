__Letter "Arrest Prator when you next get a chance, I cannot play here anymore.Here are the reasons.1) It just really isn't very fun, I was hoping to get to legend and then just settle back and talk to friends. But now protect is gone, shield sucks, Holyfire does 40% less damage for me now AND it costs 10 times as much mp per round in my area as it would have. And HF still has the bug where you cannot cast it for 2 rounds after cure.2) I just died, that is 200million exp if you remember. I am not going to waste 10 hours of my life just exping when I need to wait 20 seconds for my MP to recharge between rooms.3) My closest friend Savannah used to play here, then becuase of events I won't go into she left, and not only that, she said that I couldn't talk to her again because it would remind her of PD and she didn't want that. Staying here just reminds me of her and it is more than I can take.I might come back one day, I might just idle now with aziraphale, I don't know. But for hte moment Prator shall not exist in this realm.Prator."
