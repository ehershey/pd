__Letter "hey tell him to lighten up please and to start acting his age.I saw he got on as elendil and then he wore everything like he was going to XP...then saw i was there...then signed off and this is what i said to him:You tell Asur: i dont know if this is the reason, but I am not going to killyou on any of your alts ever again...if that is why you got off of elendiland this is his reply:Asur replies: step down as guild leaderI wish he would stop acting like he is 5 years old.  This is a game and I was being nice to him, and he has no need for an attitude.  I will not step down as guild leader b/c I am a good leader and I am one of the only ones that cares about the guild enough.I have had enough with drama on this mud, and I have had enough with him being a prick to me.you obviously dont HAVE to tell him to grow up, but it would be nice and I am asking you nicely to tell him to back off, and If I am being nice to him, I deserve the same respect.Thank you."
