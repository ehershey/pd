__Letter "The stuck demon would have to be modified to sell normal items,since oil and stone vendors are different. I'd suggest just makinghim able to sell/buy anything at all, which will cost more, buteasier to get it all done at once.The Pool is in a room already, I've coded it all up and you can see iton builder's port (along with the gauntlets) if you want.Currently the pool room is a northeast exit from the board room.The lockers could be put n, nw, or se, and it will have to be a roomas well, but I haven't coded it yet. If you have a desc for it just sendit to me and I'll use it.I don't mind making things that are useful for the guild at all,and if anyone else wants to learn to code I'd be glad to show them as well."
