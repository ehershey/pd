__Letter "02/04/03Mood: Pessimistic/Melancholy*I apologize that I did not write yesterday, but seeingas I was instructed to write reflecting what I hadlearned, and I learned nothing, it seemedinnapropriate to write.  However, I must say thattoday I have no cheerful story, or amusing analogy toaccompany this journel.  At this moment I find myselfin a most mysterious depression.  I was researchingBDSM in South Carolina and the one site I found forUSC (my chosen college) has been long since shut down. The site it linked me to said I had to be 21 andlisted no local BDSM groups(save a gay/les. group). Seeing as I am neither 21 nor gay/lesbian I find itrather insulting that they only offer information to acertain age group.  I may not be legal right now, butcome age 18 I will be just a suceptible to the creepsof the world as a novice at age 21, if not, more so. I'm so very happy that my one hope at finding somelocal support has been smashed for at least 5 years.As if this were not enough, I did some research on Gorand feel like a complete loser.  I have neither theself-restraint nor ability to preform or do half thethings this lifestyle calls for. And yet, if feels asif that is so pure.  I feel like I am no better thanthose I first criticized for using this lifestyle as asex toy. *sighs* I don't like to claim something if Ican't claim it fully and, while I realise that that isnot for everyone nor is it the only form of BDSM, Istill feel like I would be a complete insult to anyGorean slave if I ever accepted any title closelyresembling their own.  There is so much respect ingoing into a relationship like that, so much devotion. I covet it and fear it, and I know I will never graspit.  Is there enough love in this world to make such athing truly exist?  I doubt that I have enough lovewithin me to hold down half a D/s relationship rightnow.. much less something so powerful as a Gorean one. I'm not even involved in BDSM(outside of you two)and, yet, I feel utterly fake.  It's like, being giventhis beautiful plate, something you've always longedfor and finally been given.  One day you discover thatthe plate had always been broken but you had failed torealise it in your joy of recieving such a gift.  Isthe plate any less beautiful of a gift? No.  However,now you know it's broken, and for that, the plate willnever hold the glory it once had, ever again. Submissiveness is my plate.  I was finally allowed theoppertunity to reach out and grasp it, without scorn,without judgement.  Now I realise just how broken andweak my \"achievement\" was.  Is it still an achievementfor me? Hell yes.  But that doesn't take away from thefact that I have been seriously humbled and I know howcracked my plate really is.  Ever feel like you bought into something sowonderfully sweet and pure, only to find out what yougot was a mostly comercialized industry full of peoplelooking for wild sex?  Then, the thing that wouldprovide what you want so badly, from somewhere so deepwithin you that you can't explain it, is presented toyou, and you can't face it.  Is there a middle ground? Is it possible to have such a strong love, trust, andunderstanding of each other that you don't have tohave rhinestoned dog collars, a certain sexualorientation, or meet the age limit, without having tobe so self-restrained to where you feel you would losethe honesty of who you really are?Yours,Heather* I've decided to tell you my moods at the beginningof every journel.  That way if you're in a foul moodon that day you can avoid my augmenting the problem(or maybe, just maybe I can cheer you up)."
