__Letter "OK, dude, i know why you dested Ashram and from a player point of view i think that it was unfair...unfortunately as a former imm, i would have to back you up, you did tell us before that getting into other guild halls, class halls and subclass halls was illegal. So now brings me to a couple of points, first...other who abbused bugs, you say from now on, meaning they will not be dested?, why is that...is it because they were not wanred yet? And illuminati using those items to transport them to their guild hall, that was already asked by us when i first got hold of my guild and shot down by seeker, so why can they have it. If they are allowed to keep it, i would like our ring to be put in and our guild idea of a voosh command thought over.Faust....P.S. I heard you guys might be comming to hawaii...let me know, i'll see if i can get some stuff taken care of *winkz*"
