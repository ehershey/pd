__Letter "I'd like to code this race:Race Name: Dark Elves (Drow-Elves)Quest Race: Yes.Race Abstract: Evil elves who worship a goddess known as Lloth, the spider queen.Preferred Class: Kataan, Necromancers, Warriors.Statistics:Strength:       *******                 Number of arms: 2Dexterity:      ********                Number of legs: 2Constitution:   *******                 Number of fingers per hand: 5Charisma:       *                       Night vision: *****Intelligence:   *********               Quest race: YESWisdom:         **********    Special Limb Info: None.Special Abilities:Drow are highly resistant to magic and as such spells have a higher chance of failure and do less damage when they do work.Immune to backstab, steal, pick, mug.Drow gain bonuses to their deception skills, combat, and spellcasting when underground.Drow may always freely PK anyone of any race in any location.Special Hinderences:The Drow's resistance to magic works both ways; healing spells do an equally amount less healing and may fail more. Note that this magic resistance does NOT apply to both beneficial and harmful spells if the caster is also a Drow.Drow suffer extreme penalties to their deception skills, combat and spellcasting when outside during the day. To fail to prepare before entering a lit area causes extreme pain, and a temporary incapacitation.Drow may be freely PK'd by anyone of any race in any location.Other:Drow must always be Satanic.Drow must swear alliance to a house clan, or be renegades and suffer penalities.Physical Description:Dark Elves are physically very similar to their elven brethren, bearing all the hallmarks of their cousins, except their skin is an ebony black and their hair a bleached, stark white. For a Dark Elf to walk on the surface during daylight brings instant pain and torment, and general incapacity. However, it is said that this was not always the case; the surfaces Elves are reluctant to admit that the Dark Elves once walked on the surface with them, sharing many of their pleasures. They were physically different during these times; with raven black hair and fair skin. Tempted by Lloth, however, they were forced underground and Lloth's influence became more then spiritual; their skin turned as black as Lloth's heart and their hair (which Elves believe to hold the good in a person) bleached stark white as their goodly spirit was drained from them. Physically beautiful, the Drow Elves are universally hated for their brutality and sheer evil.Racial Characteristics:Drow are extremely paranoid and are always expecting an ambush; this behaviour, coupled with their general hatred by all other surface races save the Demons, means they are generally not welcome in cities or developed areas. Dark Elves generally live underground where they are known as Drow or Nightwalkers."
