__Letter "I had sent you an email after you left...I did wait 10 minutes for you. After that I figured something had happened, and that you might not make it on again since it was already after our time to go.*sigh* With being forced up by my parantes, just missing you now... And my legs being sore from overowrk, this is looking to be a bad day...Argh, I have just read your mail, and it makes me feel sick to imagine this time to be over.But I know that when I get to talk to you again any sadness will be washed away...Thinking of you, my love.   Jon."
