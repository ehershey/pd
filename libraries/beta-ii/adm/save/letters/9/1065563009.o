__Letter "don't be too harsh on me ok because.. i've never done this sort of thing before.  i have no idea how to do it. i figure this is just an outline for the area...like just the base.  so.. ok dont get mad.Caeruleus - Land of the Sky---------------------------The only way to get to Caeruleus: Gate, Portal, Fly1) Caelum Castle, The Castle in the SkyGuards in Caeruleus are all Harpyiae (Harpies -- half woman half bird) with ice blasting staffs, which only a Harpy can wield, once a guard is killed the staff disintegrates, along with the Harpy's body. All the harpies are ice-blue, except for the ones who guard the King (Amphion), Queen (Celebrian), and Princess (Maranwe), who are bright white and are the only Holy Harpies to ever exist.  The Holy Harpyiae glow in an orb of bright white light and have bright white frost wings, wear white glowing halos, nd wear a crystal quiver (a quiver magically created out of soft crystals), with diamond bladed arrows.  If you kill a Holy Harpyiae you get the glowing halo, however you cannot wear it if your alignment is not Saintly or Godly.  You also get the crystal quiver with the diamond bladed arrows.  King Amphion and Queen Celebrian sit at their throne.  King Amphion is wearing a Sapphire Crown and Caeruleus robes (Robes of the Sky, they are many different shades of blue) neither of these objects auto-load.  Quee Celebrian wears a Sapphire Crown and a Caeruleus dress, neither of those items auto-load either.  The Princess, Maranwe, wears a Sapphire & Diamond tiara, which auto-loads for lvl 60 players & up.  She also wears a sparkling blue gown & diamond earrings, which auto-load for lvl 40 players & up. There is also a dungeon in the Castle which is home to many scary creatures, and Harpyiae who guard the dungeon.  There is a tower in the dungeon that houses the Prince Finarfin of Tenebrae, who is being held captie by King Amphion, because of his hatred towards Tenebrae.  Prince Finarfin came to Caeruleus to be with Princess Maranwe, his one true love, but they never got to be together again.2) Caelum City, The City in the SkyCitizens of Caeruleus are mutated humans with blue skin and white wings. Caeruleus citizens wear either blue or white garments.  3) Equus Stable, The Stable in the SkyEquus Stable is the home of three white flying horses.  You can mount these horses, once you kill their master, Ahala.  You cannot kill an equus, they are immortal.4) Caelum Forest, The Forest of the SkyHidden in a cave in Caelum Forest is a blue diamond which you can use to store items such as the black diamond, guarded by Cerberus, a three-headed dog which auto-attacks. The dog wears three ruby dog collars, which you can receive if you kill it.  The diamond has a 10% chance of auto-loading once a day.  There is a tree in caelum Forest which is home to the Gorgons (monsterous creatures with live snakes as their hair, bronze hands and golden wings), if you enter a secret passage in the tree , they auto-atack and fly after you until either you kill them or they kill you.  However, if you conquer the Gorgons, you get your hands on a beautiful sapphire and diamond encrusted golden crown of Caeruleus, once owned by the first king of Caeruleus, King Cecrops.  The crown has a 5% chance of magically remaking itself after the Harpies come back to life every two hours to come guard it once more.  The Gorgons wear sapphire necklaces, sapphire gauntlets, sapphire bracelets, sapphire rings, sapphire robes, and wieldsapphire staffs, which you get if you kill them, but they only auto-load for lvl 50 players.  In every \"room\" in the forrest there are either blue forest nymphs (beautiful maidens which are the divinities of nature) which wear beautiful blue dresses, or blue fairies (tiny pixies with wings, very low magic power) which wear nothing and are not worth very much xp.  In the middle of the forrest there is a shimmering blue portal guarded by Hydra, a many-headed serpent, who is the most difficult thing to kill inall of Caeruleus.  If you kill Hydra, you are able to enter the portal and are safely floated back to Tirun [].Caeruleus Quest:  You must kill the King & Queen of Caeruleus, and take the Princess to the dungeons.  There, you must kill all the monsters and Harpyiae, whilst protecting the Princess from everything that tries to attack her.  When you are finished, you must take the princess to her prince in the tower of the dungeon, and the quest is over."
