__Letter "Tommy -     You may have heard that recently Azire has cided and isn't going to be returning.  Because of this, I'm quite sure I will become scarce myself.  Because you weren't around for the drama that happened a month or so ago, I'll give you a quick update.  There was a short time when Azire and Venenum were \"together\" which suddenly changed when Daboura and Azire (who are friends irl) started dating.  Ven took it personally and managed to bring Helena into it because she's his friend.  So anyway, after people kept going on and on, I eventually stepped in and told them if they can't let it go, they can leave the mud.  (I'll send you the mudmail if you want)  It pretty much ended at that.  But the whole thing is, Ven remains spiteful to Azire.  Here's a few logs I pulled from just the last 2 days:[5-04 19:40:42]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ the scent of desperation will send a woman to the hills faster than anything.[5-04 19:40:46]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ lol[5-04 19:41:10]Set %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Or the scent of Venenums feet![5-04 19:41:30]%^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Nesoo cackles demonically.[5-04 19:41:52]Venenum %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Yeah, that and treating her like a regular human being, that'll do it too.[5-04 19:42:4]Set %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ o.O[5-04 19:44:10]Venenum %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Honesty, compassion, attention... need I go on really.[5-04 19:45:2]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Ahh, silly Prehistoric Glamazon Huntresses: A.D.[5-04 19:48:44]Wisp %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Guess i should organize a character pic too[5-04 19:49:56]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ definitely!!![5-04 19:49:56]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ definitely!!![5-04 19:50:10]%^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Azire wants to see Wisp art on PD[5-04 19:53:2]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ new uhh oh, tornado warning[5-04 19:53:6]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ yep[5-04 19:53:10]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ down here, too[5-04 19:53:14]Venenum %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Yay![5-04 19:53:26]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ venenum wants us to die, Dab[5-04 19:53:26]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ we got a doppler indicated tornado moving toward us[5-04 19:53:30]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ sounds like it[5-04 19:53:40]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ you dont have a basement, do ya[5-04 19:53:44]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ nope[5-04 19:53:46]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ great[5-04 19:53:52]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ aye[5-04 19:55:32]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ ok, passing us[5-04 19:58:38]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ mmm.... plantaine...[5-04 19:58:44]%^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Endbringer blows the tornado near Daboura's home.[5-04 19:58:50]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ ![5-04 19:58:54]%^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Azire smacks endbringer.[5-04 19:58:56]Venenum %^MAGENTA%^<newbie>%^RESET%^ Woohoo![6-04 9:33:19]Helena %^MAGENTA%^<cre>%^RESET%^ hmmm[6-04 9:48:55]Helena %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<cre>%^RESET%^ looks like she cided[6-04 9:49:9]Venenum %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<cre>%^RESET%^ Aye.

Whatever.[6-04 9:52:49]Venenum %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<cre>%^RESET%^ I've kinda leant that whatever she says is either wrong or just a plain out falsehood, so I'm hardly suprised that she's gone.Now he can have whatever opinion he wants, and that's fine.  But when it involves other people here he needs to stfu.  As far as I'm concerned he can go screw himself.  BUT he's also probably one of the best coder's we've got.  And since Azire's gone, I won't be around.  I don't want to go off on Ven and leave you stuck with only yourself, whit and daos.  So, I'm just going to leave whatever up to you.  I'll still do the server admin thing and help out here if you need something specific, but otherwise I'm just going to work on my mud.  I'll be on to check mail here from time to time, so if there's anything I left out, feel free to email me.                -Paul"
