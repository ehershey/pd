__Letter "heh, i miss you. just decided i'd write you a short mudmail, because its been awhile since i have. *shrugs* to keep myself occupied during your absence, i've been playing my gameboy. a lot. *lol* digging through all the ancient games i had collected.. its funny. *sigh* unfortunately, it doesn't help the time pass much more quickly than doing nothing did. *shrugs* the moment you're away from me.. time slows to a crawl. every second is torture, all i want ... ALL i want.. is to be near you again. i ache for you very much. i love you. anyway.. just a short note, not a novel. *smirk* i love you! -your girlfriend, your love (i hope.. heh), your Jenna."
