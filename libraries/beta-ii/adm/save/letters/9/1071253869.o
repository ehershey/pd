__Letter "You made a wearable rose for 'gifts' at Your & Azire's wedding (reception).  I'd like to create sort of the same, however I have no idea what armour type to call it (I'm leaving it with necklace for now).  I'd like it to be worn as a \"pin\", and on the torso.  I don't want it to be a necklace, because I'd like the user to be able to wear both a necklace and the \"pin\" at the same time (which makes perfect sense).  Thanks.-Kumi"
