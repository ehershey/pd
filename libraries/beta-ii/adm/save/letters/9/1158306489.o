__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Kumi to Endbringer Mon Mar 15 06:43:51 2004:-----Chris,Hey is there something wrong? Is everything going okay with your girlfriend and such or is there some other problem? You've seemed really upset lately (I've only recognized about 1.5-2days now, sorry) and I'm wondering if you're going to be okay.Also, I've noticed you on MSN less than usual. Are you hiding from people? I'm sorry to pry into your life, but I'm worried about you at this point. I hope that everything is okay. If you need or want to talk, even about stupid unimportant crap, please let me know. I will be here for you whenever possible.I hope nothing is wrong.Take Care,Jen"
