__Letter "A beach hugs the ocean which is surrounded by a haze, lingering as it hovers above.  The shores along the coastline bubble from the heat of the island.  The warmth of the sand is felt even through the finest pair of winter boots.  In the distance lies a huge  mountain range, and in the middle of the four mountain peaks lies a massive volcano.  Off to theside, apart from the others, is a much smaller mountain. A thick jungle rests in the center of the island, but not much can be seen without entering it.  A path of ashes leads the way around the island.The sound of the nearby sea and it's boiling water can be heard.The scent of the smoke and salt water is easily picked up.l beach -> it's covered in ash.l sand -> HOT HOT HOT!l volcano -> You gulp.l mountains -> I hope you brought your compass.l jungle -> peering through the ferns you stumble upon a traill island -> Why this is the blazing island of MaelstromDancing flames spurt everywhere causing crackling boom noises to echothroughout the island. "
