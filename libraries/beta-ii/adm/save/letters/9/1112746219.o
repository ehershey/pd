__Letter "I logged off of my internet service today, but my character arsen stayed logged on, about 5 minutes later I came back on as dubbya and arsen was still in the game, I just want you to know that i wasnt multiplaying, i was only on dubbya for about 5 seconds until i realized arsen was somehow still on, sorry about that"
