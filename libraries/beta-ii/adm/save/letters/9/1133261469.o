__Letter "hiya stormy. I had an idea to help mana users and stuff with their mana.See a problem is that you get so much mana there is no real way to get it back as fast as you use it (same problem with sp).Now being able to use more than three stones is no good, because they are cheap, everyone would do it and just have fairly unlimited mana.also, all the extra heartbeats strain the server when you start getting 100's and 100's going.what I was thinking was instead that you could merge stones together, doubling their effectiveness, and then keep merging more to it to increase it's power.This would require a master stone though, which is from a level50 quest that requires you to figure out a few riddles and puzzles from the old man in SW (who is part of the lantern quest). He can write you a note, you take it to the stone seller done in Arlon, and he gives you a master stone, which can have other stones merged into it. Then you add to the stone code to make them non functional when there is a master stone in the same inventory.Now we set a limit on the master stone so that you can only merge your intelligence / 15. So at 60 intellect, which is ok for an elite spellcaster (just) you can use 4 stones. Once you get like 120 intellect though (pretty uncommon) it is 8 stones. If you had that much intelligence though you'd have thousands and thousands of mana.Perhaps /20 is a better balance, so that you need at least 80 intellect to get a boost. That sounds better.next step is adding better sp regen for the warriors and rogues. I think it would be better if your sp *always* regenerated quickly, say like your stamina*2 per tick. This would let these people fight for longer, and when they run outta sp they can get up and run earlier as well, or keep fighting.Also, an sp giving item that gives like 1000sp back would be cool, if you could use it every 30 seconds or so, and you could only have 1.That's all for now."
