__Letter "Yeah, and my handling of the whole situation was bad as well. I apoloize for some of the things I said and I too should have not used Darksoul line to talk with you about these things. I sat and wrote out this long ass email, looked like a book in way of an apology, when I hit spell checker it ate my email. I was so pissed then, it took 20 minutes to write it the first time. I just want you to know, I consider what happened an argument between friends, not a player vs staff thing, cause you are my friend and I hope a silly little argument won't change that no matter what.StormyStormy"
