__Letter "I have created this directory on builders.I am weeding through the /doc directory in preparations for thetutorial system i intend of coding very soon. In the process, Ihave read just about every file IN the /doc directory and decidedsome of them just were NOT for public knowledge. I know most ofthem are beyond the reach of a builder anyways. I feel howeverthat information pertaining to the mud's link, master, the driver,etc. just had no buisness being in directories where a buildercould read them.I will be coding the _tutor.c to allow archwizards to referance thematerial by the time im done.Ironman"
