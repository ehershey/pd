__Letter "Sorry I have not been around when you were on, real life has gotten kinda crazy with this new buisness we got into, but we stand to make quite a bit of money, so the sacrifices seem worth it for now. Also with my kids going back to school soon, things should get back to a more normal schedual ;)Hope the new job is working out for you and life is treating you fairly.O, I need to know what was changed with summoning demons and raising dead, it seems players are ending up with 2 after battle sometimes and I am trying to track the bug down.Stormy"
