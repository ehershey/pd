__Letter "Haven't had much to keep you updated on - nothing major changed lately.I've got a list made of things to fix/change on main port beforeupdating builders, but nowhere near done yet. I'll let you knowwhen it's ready. If you get bored you could make a list of things thatneed to be backed up and copied back over after the main port -> buildersupdate happens."
