__Letter "This was reported to me by a player who reads Venenum's Livejournal.Well, the backstabbing bitchqueen bagged out my draft for a script for PD's new death sequence today, but I'm hardly surprised. The best reason she could come up with was that the Fates were \"directly from Greek Mythology\"- like the Grim Reaper is a 100% original PD idea, not at all stolen from any Mythology in the whole world! She didn't elaborate, but just said that 'I'm not gunna argue, the admins will decide.' Damn right they will, so keep your petty opinions to yourself, tornadobait. At least, until you have a decent reason.And now, I'm off to class.*sigh* ... *goes to take a bath*"
