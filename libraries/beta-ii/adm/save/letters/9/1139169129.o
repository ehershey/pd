__Letter "Hey Simran, this is me, Josh. I decided to make a new character because I wanted a character that's good PvP (player vs. another player) So that way if anyone starts stuff with me I can just get on this guy and whoop them :P. And I don't think you were lying about having a lot of work, I trust you completely :), but I already miss you so much and I wish I could call you right now and just talk to you all day and night. Your voice is so enchanting and sexy it's not even funny, I can't wait until I can actually see you in person and hold you in my arms. I miss you tons Cutie and hopefully I'll be able to talk to you tonight. *hugs and kisses*Forever yours,Josh(p.s. You know you liked those dirty thoughts!!!! :P)"
