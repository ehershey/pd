__Letter "Well i was gonna get on and mud for a little bit, but for wsome reason gmud is not wanting to run. I doulbe-click on the exe file, but it never does open. i tried re-downloading it, but that still didn't work. It's possible it could be because of something my dad changed on the computer. He was on my computer when i woke up from my nap. So who knows. But it's gonna really bug me if i can't get gmud to work by tonight. :(Anyway, if you have an idea on this, send me email, not mudmail because i probably won't be on PD until i get gmud workingI gotta go.Love you,Heather"
