__Letter "Hi, you may not know me, but I met Xenia the other day and shethought maybe we would get along. :) My name is Zamaki and I'ma level 3 centaur gypsy. I know it's rare to see a centaur thatis also a gypsy around here, but I like to be different. I knowI don't see many lady gnoll warriors either. Maybe we'd be a good team? :) Feel free to drop me a line sometime. I'd love to get to knowyou.Zamaki"
