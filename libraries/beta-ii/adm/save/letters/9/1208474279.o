__Letter "Hey love, how are you today? Fine, I hope. I finished one classand am at the middle of another. We had a test today. I dont thinkI did too shabby. :) I forgot to bring my medication with me so Iwill be a couple hours behind on taking a dose, but I think I'll be okay. :) I am also wishing I could sleep! But I might not havethe time for that. It's a beautiful day outside and I am spendingit in a classroom...some pros and cons to that. Considering I stillhave a little bit of a cold, I dont mind a nice, temperature controlledenvironment. :)Well, I hope to see you on later. My internet was out at home earlierin the day as they were working on the lines, they said. So, Ihope I'll have access when I get home and maybe see you then. :)Take care, sweet love,Your JamesP.S. - Howdy!"
