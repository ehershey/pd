__Letter "i regret to inform you that your idea about demon tail spikes with a special attack has been unsuccessful at this time.for any other ideas, please mail me. if you'd just like them to be demon tail spikes, they can be, but i think they'd have to have only a Slight highly more AC to the other generic tail ties i created available in tirun.Thank You For Your Time.~Helena."
