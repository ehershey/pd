__Letter "Messages I want to be red:I love the way you hold me so close when we kiss.I love our tickle fights. I love the way you squirm when I caresss those \"special\" spots.I love the way you wrap your arms around me and won't let me go.I love snuggling up and watching movies with you.I love that I can go straight to sleep when I'm lying in your arms.I love it when you \"mark\" me as yours.I love how we're just the perfect height for each other.I love your eyes, how they draw me into you.I love it when we take each other's breath away.Now the white roses:I love that big happy grin you get on your face whenever we're together.I love the way you say \"huggles\".I love that simply being with you help s me to feel better, no matter how bad of a day I've had.I love the way we can just totally let everything go and relax with each other.I love that we sigh together, the exact same way.I love sitting on your lap while we play Heroes 3.I love the way you make me feel bouncy sometimes.I love wiggling with you.I love it when you sing to me.And finally, if this one can *always* be the very last rose he reads:But most of all, I love that I've got you, for the rest of my life. :)Happy 20th Birthday, honey!If you can make the last line of that (happy birthday etc) some pretty color. And, if that can't *always* be the very last rose he reads, then just change the message to:I love that I've got you, for the rest of my life.Got any questions? ask me :)"
