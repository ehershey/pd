__Letter "Ohh yeah, believe me I know. That's pretty much why I was removed. Because I don't want to agree with their stupidity. They hate people just for the sake of hating, and because I defended something I thought was right, actually I gave some diamonds to a forsaken member...That's why I was removed, and they claimed I was being treacherous to their guild. That's why I started Ethereal. :)-kumi"
