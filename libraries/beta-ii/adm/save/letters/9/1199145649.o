__Letter "Dearest sweetest ladyest, err, lady, I hope you have a wonderfultime wherever you are as you ring in the new year. I was missingyou and so I decided to watch Shrek the Halls (finally) because it reminded me of you. :) It was a very sweet story and a nicelittle visit to all the familiar faces from the movie. I will beworking tonight, so I need to put my head down and get a littleshuteye. But, I would feel really bad if I didn't send you thismessage letting you know you are missd and appreciated and lovedand all that good stuff. See you when I see you and enjoy yourselffirst and foremostest. :D Talk to you next year, love. :)Loe,James"
