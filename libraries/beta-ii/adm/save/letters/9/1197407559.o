__Letter "Sorry I didnt have a chance to talk to you more or say a propergoodbye. My weak little computer up and crashed on me leaving meRayna-less. :( But, I guess I should take a c(l)ue and actuallyget started on my work. It was a profound pleasure to speak withyou for as long as I did and I look forward to the next time. :)Take care and stay you. :)Love,James"
