__Letter "Dear Rayna, How are you? Fine, I hope. I guess I couldnt catchyou on after the shower. I got some more sleep before helpingmy niece move out of her dorm. I am in a dorm myself tonightand I am trying to write a little poem...used to do it all the time.Anyway, when it's ready, you'll hear it first. :)Gotta run, duty calls!Love,James"
