__Letter "First, I pocketgag and out comes the rabbit. I ask Mathius if hewants to kill it. He attack, later Piehl attacks, and he refuses to die. Loses over 40 limbs. Only dies when Mathius uses hissummoned assassin. Also didnt wanna die to Rejik and Yang. Apparently, the small pretty flower makes people aggro and I hadthe rabbit squirt Rejik. He was also wielding weapons, I believeand had sold stuff at the shop and bought and drank booze. Notsure if that's a factor, but I'd like to help.Me"
