__Letter "Don't be upset.. it wasn't your fault  It was mine  I paniced plain and simple  I don't do well in those situationsI went to look for you and while i was trying to find you walked into a mob of 6, one had been injured.  When i fleed, i went into another room of 6 where one had been injured.  In hindsight i can say oooo yeah i should have wrapped fleed flew or whatever but i don't... stupidly my first instinct is to rub oil..... i just freeze.Please don't feel bad, i just go quiet for a bit, need a bit of time out where i can beat myself up.  Things are just a little worse at the moment.  I'm just missing Gob so much at the moment and i keep trying to tell myself i don't and yeah that works for a little while until something goes wrong.Wisp"
