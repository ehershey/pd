__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Ironman to Ironman Thu Oct 19 13:47:24 2006:-----I wrote a new simul_efun on builders today. The details of it arein a mail to you guys over there. I'm keeping it between us untilyou folks look it over and tell me how tight you want the securitynet to be on builders. With this new simulefun, we can make it soa fly can't fart without our permission over there *grin*.Please review it and email me a replyIronman"
