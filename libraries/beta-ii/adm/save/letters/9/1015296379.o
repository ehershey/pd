__Letter "Ive had reports of Jekhar, a lvl 25-30 kataan, killing in drows. Soulfly asked him how he was doing it and he told soulfly he had a secret way. Ive got a hunch he is either abusing a bug really really bad or using something overpowered in the kataans.Be great to see what the hell he is up to killin drows."
