__Letter "Ability - AttackName - MultistrikeEffect - Takes three rounds to complete, a initiative hit, a secondary hit, and a finishing hit. You can't do the second or finish hit without doing the one before.I thought it would be a cool combo idea for your new system, since the same attacks over and over are probably not goign to work"
