__Letter "Today, Spade came on (Anguish' alt) and wanted to party. I said it was toolate because it was 3 am. I thought maybe you left because of somethingI had said in our discussions and it was probably a coincidence. I thought maybe it was because I was upfront in my discussions.Hope to talk to ya soon. I'm still catching up on rest, but doing better.Ray"
