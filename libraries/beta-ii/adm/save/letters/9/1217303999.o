__Letter "Almost missed today! Was so busy withother crap. :) This is not crap, tho. ;) I had class today which went well.I find it goes a lot better when you read most of the homework assignment. :D Put in some grievances for some guys including that one who got fired for cursing out the supervisor.Slept pretty well, tho it was shorter than I'd like. I hopeyou are having an excellent adventure. ;)Anyway, it was a good day, learned some cool stuff and uh oh, lost train of thought.Back to work with me, I will say howdy later when it's tomorrw. :DI love you with all my heart.Love,Your James"
