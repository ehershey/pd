__Letter "I got a mudmail saying i went linkdead to try and avoid death. Well here's what really happenedThere is a bug in the game and that is why i diedI didn't go linkdead. My connection went down and basically left me unable to use abilities. no big deal normally as my wimpy is set to around 15000 hp so i always will wimpy out when i lahg out which i do all the time from wireless network. However if you get hit by flying drop kick (which the monsters in the carina's area use) then your wimpy does not work. There is a bug so that it is brokenb. So you are sitting unable to defend yourself, and you cannot wimpy out. So if you disconnect like i often do because of my bad connection then you are sure to die. This is a horrible bug and I lost almost 3000 million exp because of it (300 million. telenet so i can't tell what i'm ty;ping). This is the reason i haven';t been playing anymore.Please look into this bug and please do something about everything I lost. This is a very nasty issue and that area is completely unusable with it in place. -- Vyce"
