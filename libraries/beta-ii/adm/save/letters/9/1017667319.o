__Letter "What is up with that. You are being friendly, and then I I bring up an argument for archangels and demons to have their own classes, and suddenly everything I say and post is a complaint, and that all I ever do is complain, and that my character is really weak and that that doesn't give me the right to complain, and that I am an idiot, and that I am a crybaby, and that I should xp faster so I don't die so easily, that I shouldn't cry so much becuase I died.Soulfly, you didn't read my post right. Faust has never killed me, he has never even been in combat with me. I have never died to a pk. I am not a weak character, I do make 3 Mill exp an hour and I am getting good stats. In fact, faust probably can't kill me unless I am unlucky. I am not afraid of his move. I simply wanted it known to the admins that it wasn't right that faust could be cloaked all of the time because it means that we can't find him to pk him. I have said, many times, that I don't care if he pk's me with cloak, I only care if he leaves cloak on and runs away.I would like it if you guys were more like Stormbringer and be more polite when you have something to complain about me.	- Aziraphale"
