__Letter "Hey, I just wanted to clarify something.I know that you are a good guy. I've said it and I've heard many others say it. You're nice, helpful, and all the other wonderful things about you. I did not think that you would be mean to Xyran (warren). Not at all. But I wanted to be sure you knew how I felt about that situation. I like to solve problems before they start, even if there's a next to 0 chance of the problem occuring. That's the situation here. I know that chances are very slim that you would be mean to Warren, but I still like to take care of that problem before it has a chance to start. Do you understand a little better now why I sent you that mail about Warren? I hope so. Savannah"
