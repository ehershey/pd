__Letter "I checked into the error Endy told me about.File is /wizards/daos/obj/gold_egg.cIt seems you have your egg ADDING uses where ya ment to -- them.Simple typo but it gives the egg an infinite supply of uses.It should START with 20 uses and count down before deleting itselflike oils do.Could fix her but i can't bring her accross to the main site thoIronman"
