__Letter "one spell i know is alot stronger tha it probably should be, is vortex, im not ABOSLUTELY positive about it tho, just throwin that out thereand also, annihilate does over double the damage of firebomb, and takes major major mp to use, but i got annihilate around 10, and firebomb around 25-30, shouldnt firebomb do a bit more? i know dabby downgraded it to make room for nova, but seems firebomb does a little bit to less damagesorry if i sound like im complaining, im really not, im not to worried about it, but some other people might be"
