__Letter "I donno how he earned imm, but regardless I don't trust him and I'd like it if you could restrict him from stating or snooping me.  I think he'll tell his guild members my stats and everyone elses who hates his guts, which is basicaly everyone on the mud.  I really don't feel safe with him as an imm, just my two cents..."
