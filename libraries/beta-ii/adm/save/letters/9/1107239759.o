__Letter "I like the idea of making people fall after they run out of SP is good, but AFTER the beta test is over and bugs are minimal.You could make them fall into a random outdoor room in that area/folder.  I'm not so sure how the sky system works, but if they fell a certain number of rooms, it could be that you need 50 str per room that you fall, otherwise you take 1000 damage for that room?It has a lot of potential.  I haven't experienced it myself, but I like what I hear so far.Levi"
