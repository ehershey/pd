__Letter "In reguards to the Eidolons.Could you decrease their weight? 40 is a bit high. Or is that how much good blades usually weigh? If so, never mind, and sorry :).Also, could you make it so that the shop sells 4 blades at a time, instead of just one at a time? There are two staves and three rings at a time, it would be better if members that it doesn't autoload for could at least get what they need when they first pop on.Thanks Whit :)-Jen"
