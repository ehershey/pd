__Letter "I need to clear something up here.I was told by Nesoo and Daboura to use heart_beat() and not call_out().It was brought to my attention that others were told to use the opposite.It was my impression that call_out() causes the mud to lag up if thereare to many of them outstanding. Can we please have a consensus on thisissue and get back to me ?"
