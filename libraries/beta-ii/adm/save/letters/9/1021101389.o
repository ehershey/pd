__Letter "And definately do not tell anyone about what the deed rewards them with, Clearmoon knew what the reward is so I am just asuming you told her... anyhow, just live by the rule I do, anything a player can't see in the game they do not need to know about, this includes how many demons they can summon, what skills/stats a spell or abil uses, etc...Just wanted to let you know. I will be on from around noon till 3 on saturday, going to a ranger game saturday night so if I do not see you then, hopefully I will see you sundayStormy"
