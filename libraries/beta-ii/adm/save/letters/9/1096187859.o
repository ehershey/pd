__Letter "I talked to Stormy, and he said for me to take care of it.  Your character will be returned the 31, 2 days before the guild event because it has been rescheduled.  I dont want to hear anymore problems about you either.  You need to mail me though, because I will forget, guaranteed.My grammar sucks, I know, its 3:30am after a long night.  Went on a date and feel asleep at Amanda's house.  Well, peace.WhitP.S.  Im in a really good mood :)"
