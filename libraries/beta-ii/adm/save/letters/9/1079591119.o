__Letter "oh hell no that had nothing to do with you. the one that was referring to you was the * & * thanks for all the help you do for pd and staying out of all the drama. the one you think is referring to you is referring to daos. he pissed me off last night because he kept bothering me and treating me like i was a bitch for trying to protect myself. that's all. i put him on ignore and stuff. i would never say that about you. you've never ignored me or anything justin. if i had a problem with you, you'd know it. daos knows i have aproblem with him., everyone that i wrote something mean about knows i have a problem with them, this isn't news. i was just posting how i was feeling because i was tired of getting all this backlash and not being able to defend myself.i'm sorry that you think it was meant for you, i didn't even think you'd think that. i'm so sorry. please don't think that okay?*hug*-jen"
