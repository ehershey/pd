__Letter "I've known about derferancing a variable pointer using the (*) operator.I just recently learned about the $() operator. I was told that it isused to allow the values of a variable to be used within the (: :) bracketsof a funtion pointer.If any of you have more information on this, please get back to me with it.I would like to learn more about these two operators so i can write uphelp files for builders.Even if we dont wish the builders to have this information. I can put thefiles into the /adm/doc folder for our own referancing.Ironman"
