You sense that its true power comes into play when you snatch it off.________________________________________________________________<snatch choker> to activateThe beads would fly around you in a defensive formation, occasionallyblocking an opponent's attack then falling away. This would reducethe amount of times future attacks could be blocked. After a setamount of time, the remaining beads would fall away and the itemwould be no more. Worn, it would have about the same AC as asilver locket.Anubis of the Dead should sell this item for 5000 gold."
