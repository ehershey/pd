__Letter "Well i have been thinking about this for a little while...And I'd like your take on my thoughts...Well when it comes to law zones, etc...I think that a great deal of the \"Wilderness\" areas should be lawless...Some right outside of a lawful city would still have to be lawful though...People will police a little out of their borders after all.But i just think that other wilderness areas that are apart from most cities and such should maybe be lawless as well...Someone gets killed out there, who would be around to tell the authorities?I dunno if im getting my thought across too well...But im sure ye understand."
