__Letter "Ok, here are the two things I have no idea how to do.1.) A dog blocking the exit.  His name is \"Kujowuff\".  He's Seeker's divine hound dog type thing and wont let anyone pass him.  He can't be beat in combat by a mortal, dishes out drow-like damage (he will have a warning sign the room ahead) and will only let someone through if they give him the golden bone.  I'm not sure if it should become a deed that will allow the player to go in as many times as they want or if they should have to repeat the bone part of the quest again and again if they fail.  Use your best judgement.2.) Some bells and a priestess to go with them.  The bells can be rang in any order but they do nothing.  If they are rung in \"large, small, large, medium, large\" then  the priestess will think you're a member of the priesthood and let you pass her.  You also need to be wearing \"/wizards/leviathas/arm/priestrobe.c\" so when you go by she still knows who you are.3.) An example of how a store works (like just point me to a directory with it).Thanks much, if there's anything too hard or anything I could try to pass one on to Seeker.Lev"
