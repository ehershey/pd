__Letter "Hello, please tell Escobar that I will be on later.  I tried a few times,but I assume he is sleeping (good dreams, I hope).Tell him that his Nenet loves him dearly and treasures every momentshe spends with him.  I know he is very busy with his other duties,as a rogue thug and giantish duties.  Thank you,Nenetxoxo to Escobar"
