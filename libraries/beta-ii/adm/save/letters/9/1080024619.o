__Letter "Ok... so I'm having the problem making the book disapear when it's nighttime. We didn't set that up while you were here. I made up the \"remove_item()\" part... I don't know if that's wrong or not. I don't get any errors... so I'm not sure. It's daytime, so I can't check it out. anyways... I make a clone of the book, drop it in the room, then reset the room. I figure, in theory, the room should run all it's functions, realize it's not nighttime, and remove the book... but it doesn't. the book stays in the room. (on a side note, remind me sometime how to make mobs not keep adding to one another. like, every repop they just add another mob, instead of keeping just 1 in the room or whatever) Anyways, here is my code... let me know what's wrong with it. It's file swhouse1of3e1.c by the way.#include <std.h>#include <vayne.h>inherit ROOM;void create() { ::create();   set_properties( ([ \"light\" : 1, \"town\" : 1, \"night light\" : 1, \"inside\" : 1]) );   set_short(\"Small House Side room\");   set_day_long(\"%^ORANGE%^This sideroom appears to be a little cleaner than the rest of the house.
