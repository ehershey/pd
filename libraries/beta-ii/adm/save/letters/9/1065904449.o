__Letter "Well, I wasn't going to have the prince go to tenebrae or anything, in what I'm making for my area, there is a Prince (Finarfin) of tenebrae, it IS possible to have more than one prince, no?  And he's in love with the princess, Maranwe, but the evil queen of caeruleus is holding the prince captive in the dungeon tower....so the quest is to reunite the princess with the prince and kill the evil queen and many other monsters along the way....i figured it would be a nice way of tying a couple areas together on pd. it would also be kinda neat if it was possible to take the prince and princess to tenebrae to introduce them to the king and queen of tenebrae...but that's going a little too far ahead of my plans.and of course i am gonna ask, it is your area :p  -jen(kumi)"
