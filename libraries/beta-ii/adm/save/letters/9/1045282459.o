__Letter "Hey there. How's everything going?Listen, I need to talk to you. I'm not going to lie to you. Xyran, the newbie I've been helping out, is my boyfriend irl. He hates muds, he's just playing to talk to me. But anyway, you may have already suspected who is was. Still, i have a request. the reason i didn't tell you earlier is because i was afraid you'd treat him like dirt or something. I know you're jealous of him. I just want you two to try to be civil. Me and him will probably be getting mudmarried within the next week, but not for the reason you think. Mine and his relationship develops irl, not here. I just want to marry him here so i can get all the guys that are flirting with me off my back. I'm tired of having to deal with that crap because it's hard for me to tell the guys \"no.\"I don't want to make you more jealous. I just want us to still be friends and you to be nice to Xyran (warren). Thanks,Savannah"
