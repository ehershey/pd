__Letter "I dont believe its wise to call me an uneducated idiot.  You are not required to read posts nor is your opinion needed on posts especially if they result in me being called an uneducated idiot.  I posted I link that I find quite humerous so lets get your shit straight.  Also, I can put whatever I want on PD.  I believe what you dont realize is, well, I FUCKING OWN PD.  I can take alot of crap, but dont ever EVER insult me personally or my political opinion because Im rather apathetic on politics.  That message was found on Digg and I reposted it.I dont believe in dictatorships, but here, I am the boss.  I usually don't care what happens because your right, this place is a place away from the real world.  But dont attack me personally.  That is a mistake.Whit"
