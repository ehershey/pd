__Letter "Hey there, honey. (I just love saying that. *grin*) I miss you already. I finally finished maxing my skills. Now I'm working on stats, which i'm sure will take just as long as skills did. *groan* I'm not looking forward to it. But those angels and demons in the sewer can get me about 1million xp in one trip, so hopefully it won't take too terribly long to get stats up. I'll know not ever rush to a level again. *frown* It takes too long to catch up. Well, hope to see you soon. Until then...*Savannah kisses you wildly with a passion that can only hint at what is to come. Then she winks and vanishes to the shadows.*"
