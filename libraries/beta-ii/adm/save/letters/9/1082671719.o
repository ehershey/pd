__Letter "Iam so sorry azireAre you able to assend to the astral planes?Maby you could look for his spirit on the planes?It might be possable because you have allready spoken \\with it so many times befor, that even if he is reincarnatedthat you might be able to visit him in his dreams?i had a bit of a moving time yester day, i founda bush bee on the roof of a job site in the city.I really like bush bees, they seem to be hardworkers,so i picked him and and carried him around for a whilei was going to take him down stairs and put himon a flower. So i cuped my hands into like a little cave type thing for him and he went insidesat on my finger on it inside... and died...he died in my hands, Azire how come all my handsseem to do is stuff everything they touch?It was a little odd for me, i felt funy about thewhole thing... Any ways, cant wait to catch you againNathan"
