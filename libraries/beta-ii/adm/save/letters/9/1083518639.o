__Letter "I have returned your characters for now.  Do not take this threat likely.  I know you are the same person, and I have proof that you have transfered money between your alts.  I have removed all of your bank accounts.  This decision will not be changed.  If I find any transfers of money between any of your characters, I will instantly rid you.  This is your only warning.Whit"
