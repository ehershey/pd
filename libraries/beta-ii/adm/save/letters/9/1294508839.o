__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Smokey to Stormbringer Mon Jan  3 19:33:07 2011:-----I feel I have been harassed by Baine. I was attacked by him and Frisky earlier today, and killed them both. I went back out to xp after being threatened by Baine repeatedly and got attacked by him and Sopboo. I am taking a good break from PD because of him. I came here to get away from Merentha and the endless coding but would rather be back there than be dealing with him. He's had a personal vandetta against me for months across both muds. Stormy"
