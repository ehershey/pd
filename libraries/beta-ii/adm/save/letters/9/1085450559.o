__Letter "I will not delete anythingEverything you coded on builders belongs to Primal Darkness.As for the rest, though it out. You and Kumi put code onto my game from Pyro. I have no idea how that code got here, for all I know you let him log on to code it. In matters of security I do not and will not give advanced notice of anything. To keep anyone from trying to bring down builders, I arrest first and ask questions later. I do not plan on asking you any questions. I do not want you building for PD. Anyone who won't apologize for acting the way you did does not deserve anything from me of the staff. You are welcome to play here, no one will bother you, no one is tracking your every move, etc. We just won't be around if and when you do need our help or want to submit Ideas.Good day.Stormy"
