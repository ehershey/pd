__Letter "/d/nopk/tirun/ewayward2/d/nopk/tirun/chapelThese two rooms overlap. I'd recommend making the chapel an 'up' exit from the main monastery room. Oh yeah, and the monk hall kind of goes east over, well, nothing. Perhaps making it a small tower kinda place would be better. Like east, then up to join room, then up to hall, then up to the vote room, if you want to keep it./d/nopk/tirun/fighter/warrior/warrior_hall/d/nopk/tirun/clergy/clergy_joinThese two rooms also overlap. Setting the warrior_hall to south from the join room would make it all good.I have a little map thing ~that I can upload if you want to see a graphical representation of what I could find of the town.Also, if you want to touch it up a little. The weapon repairman has a nort and south exit to his room, it makes it seem like a little shop on hte street. It'd be a bit nicer if it only had the north exit. The houses around the place - Haunted House, infinite torch deed house, sick child deed house and some player's house - are all 'enter' entrances. Just so that the town can be properly mapped, could they be standard exits instead? Just then we could make a really proper map."
