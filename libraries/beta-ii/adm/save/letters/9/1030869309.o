__Letter "Yakko has been using scripts to stay alive while afk. As rule 11 says:Scripting while away from the keyboard is not allowed. If you are goingto play you must be at the keyboard while doing anything. If you are notthey rest one room away, or loot the corpse when they are done unlessyou are partied together.I'm not sure exactly what this script was doing but every time i attacked him I would get 1 slash off and maybe 1-2 rounds then he would flee and automatically heal from a oil or soul.  I knew that he was using a script because as soon as he would flee his character would go idle straight away.Please can something be done about this.  --Eios.Ps> I think i copied part of another rule up top but the first line says it all."
