__Letter "-----Original message sent by Kumi to Azire on Tue May 11 21:23:57 2004:-----I never said I felt that you had a personal vendetta against me, did I? That's your assumption.As far as monitoring Ethereal, I never said not to do so, go ahead. I just don't want you talking about personal things on there, immortals shouldn't be doing that. It isn't your job to do those things. I don't really care if everyone backs you on this, if you continue to talk about personal things on the ethereal line, I will report it.Do not mudmail me again, this is your last warning."
