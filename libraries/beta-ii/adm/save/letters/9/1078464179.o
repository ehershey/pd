__Letter "Hey, I'm looking for an advanced LPC coder who is interested in helping write Ethereal objects/rooms/mobs. Even the smallest help is wanted. Cookie suggested that I try talking to you, and I thought it would be a good idea, even though you're probably very (too) busy with your own area. If you're interested let me know, I'll allow you to write your own items for the guild, I'll pay for it all, whatever you want as long as it is legal and non-offensive (and follows PD theme of course :P). I'd be willing to pay you or figure a way out to compensate you, and you would be promoted to whatever position you're most interested in.I look forward to hearing from you.-Jen"
