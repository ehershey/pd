__Letter "Hey Rayna, it's me, Josh, I'm thinking about putting Noki on hold, I'll tell you why and maybe you can tell me if you agree or not, if not I\"ll just cont. him. But you see, I asked Daboura about the move called rage, which is why I picked berserker, it's a move that only they get. And he said it was a move that was wrongly coded and he isnt' going to fix it, he's just going to redo berserkers here in a while, I asked him how long and he said it'll be a while, well he's the laziest immortal out of them all almost so Noki will always be weak until Daboura fixes them which could be atleast a month to 3 months...knowing him atleast. So yeah, I thought I'd make a character similar to yours, but if you think I should keep Noki incase Daboura really goes through with his word I will, no worries :) I love you and can't wait to talk to you."
