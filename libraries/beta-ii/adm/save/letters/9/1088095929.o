__Letter "i got a situation.i really want my character back. this is what happened.i scry kumi + evolution. they were in this room. i gate to them and attack them with my undeads (necromancer) and try to attack myself. its spammy with 5 undead hits swinging ya know?so once i realize my attacks weren't hitting personally..i checked zone. i was in safety zone. so i left..noone died.now this is kumi and evolution people who are no longer here banned for server hacks or something i don't know. that's what i was just told.if i can get my necromancer \"Shadimar\" back..i'd be really greatful. thanks..."
