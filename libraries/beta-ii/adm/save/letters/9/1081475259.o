__Letter "I talked with Tahngarth a little bit tonight and she said that she was Barrin's alt. I thought that was odd since Tahngarth is in Ethereal. I asked Helena about it and she said to tell Tahn that there was a new message on the Illuminati board that should be checked out. Tahn just kinda shrugged it off saying that s/he had just checked the board last night. Barrin's finger says that he was last on Tuesday. But Tahn did say that the last posts were about PKs. Helena thought that was just a lucky guess and I agree because s/he gave no specifics. Helena then told me to mail you. So I did and here we are. And that's all."
