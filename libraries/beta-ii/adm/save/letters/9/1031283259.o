__Letter "Dude, don't worry, i know how you feel and having a migraine is nothing easy. Its cool and i will post about prator. We will give him a week or so off, thing is i have never killed him for being aziraphale, yakko didn't either, but ashram...thats a different story. He is in my guild, and i will back him up anyway possible, but if you wish for him to not pk prator, please inform him."
