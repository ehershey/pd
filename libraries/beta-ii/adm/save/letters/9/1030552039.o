__Letter "well, i'm headed home in a few hours. I'm giving you a heads up right now, because i'm probably not going to be a very happy jenna tonight. Mayuki has gone.. and i'm quite raw inside. On top of it all, i'm trying to figure out just where i fit with you, your relationship with wisp, etc. there are a lot of things bubbling up in my mind, all of which i hope will not interfere with things overmuch. *hug* i mis you very much, Paul. i'll be giving you a call tonight. *waves*Your Jenna"
