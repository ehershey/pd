__Letter "yeah, I'll help you get it fixed.  just get a hold of me while I'm on sometime.  I have a hard time getting online atm, but just bring it up whenever and I can fix it for you.  Also..  just to make sure this is fixed...  how long ago did you get the death mark?  if it was just recently I need to fix that.  Otherwise, I think it used to be a problem but was fixed about a week or two ago.  Thanks                  -Nightshade"
