__Letter "hp: 1297|sp: 936|mp: 1080 >  You shear Drow invader to pieces in the left hand with your dark blade.You graze Drow invader in the torso with your dark blade.You slice Drow invader in the right hand with your dark blade.You slice Drow invader horribly in the torso with your dark blade.Drow invader SLASHES you severely with his sword!A mortal blow is dealt to your body!Davyn is dealt a mortal blow to the torso!So this happened and it seems a bit out of place. None of the drow there have ever done anything close to that amount of damage. Thought it might be a bug or something. Dont expect my death back or anything if its a bug just want to catch it."
