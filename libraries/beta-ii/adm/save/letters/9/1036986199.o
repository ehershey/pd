__Letter "Hermes may pretend to be a typical clean cut Kansas boy most of the time. However there are always two sides to the coin, for underneath his facade there is a far more sinister side that lurks. For once this editor leaves the office he becomes a creature of unbelievable perversion. For this reporter has learned of a now, not so well kept secret, of his. For he has been having a tawdry affair with endbringer, a well known assassin of the realm. Endbringer is however married to self proclaimed lesbian, Suri. She too is an assassin. Suri is completely unaware of her spouses activities with Hermes, I must stress.	Endbringer is not what 'she' would appear to be, 'she' is in fact a hermaphrodite. But that is not all, 'she' in fact has an alter-ego in which 'she' is a cow. It is with this cow persona that Hermes perverse side shows up in a more blatant form. I don't believe this needs to be elaborated upon any further. However there is sufficient proof to back this up as we have several witnesses of these acts of unspeakable perversion. Wraith reports seeing them break into Vennenums' house and defiling every square inch of the well guarded place. Another report comes from Shogun who saw the two in the pit, after he had been placed there by Daos who says to have been bored at the time. 	One can only imagine what caused Hermes to go so far off the rails. Was it that he harboured these perversions all his life, or could a significant event have caused this? After an interview with his parents it became clear he had a childhood that didn't appear to have had any indication of such tendencies. Though his mother did say he always seemed rather subdued while drinking his milk. Perhaps the not so feminine wiles of endbringer brought out a well hidden side of Hermes' that none could have suspected even existed.	People of Primal Darkness I believe we must try to stop this fowl behaviour as soon as we can. This could potentially tarnish the reputation of PD and thus we must start the clean up process immediately. Perhaps we should start with Vennenums' house by the sounds of it. If anyone sights these two interacting I suggest you get in contact with the law. I'm sure most of their activities are illegal.Autema"
