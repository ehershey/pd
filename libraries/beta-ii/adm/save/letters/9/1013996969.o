__Letter "Unholy/Forsaken/and Darksouls have made a treaty:Underworld TreatyDarksoul WraithForsaken Ashram/DryfusUnholy Leviathas/WildflowerThis treaty represents the peace among the three said guilds.  There should beno inter-guild pking unless:A: a sponsor event where as all guild members participateB: guild leader approves pk of their own member for whatever reason, but musthave the permission of said guild leader(s).Also, this treaty reprents the truce of the three said guilds.  At no time, oneguild has more say then the other two.  If a disiplinary action must be dishedout it is between the guild leader and it's member(s).  The only time otherguilds will be notified if and when an inter-guild pk has occured.If and when possible, each said leader will be updated on new members of saidthree guilds.It has been in effect for a while and it will stay so unwill stay in effect for a whileWe were also planning war with blackforce most of all, and pretty much all of the other guilds lolthat has yet to be determined, although none of us like blackforec and its leader lolWe will need a treaty hall and hopefully a treaty line named Underworld the only ppl who will have this line should be the council and leaders of all 3 guildsMy idea for the hall was going to be set in Hell itself, a room made out of slightly cooled lava with a huge flame for a boardif you have any questions give me a mudmail or tell."
