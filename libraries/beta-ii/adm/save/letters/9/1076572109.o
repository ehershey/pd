__Letter "I had the idea that instead of just randomly garbling a language if you cannot properly speak/understand it, perhaps it could be written in a simple code. If you've played FFX then just think the way they handled the techy race language.Basically you just replace any \"A\" with \"B\", \"B\" with \"C\", and so on. So \"Hello\" becomes \"Ifmmp\". \"Understand\" becomes \"Voefstuboe\", etc. I thought this would be better because it would make the language 'learning' system much more transparent. At the moment if you understand a word it makes total sense, if you don't then it is so garbled it is very obvious you didn't understand it. This way, you could evaluate each letter individually.Even better, you could change it so that instead of having 10 ranks in a language, there are 26, each one corresponding to a letter (and punctuation is always understood). Then, for the sage, instead of each level taking longer to learn, each one could take an equal portion of say... 26 hours. So studying for an hour will net you a new understood letter.So yeah, thought that was kinda cool."
