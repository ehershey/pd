__Letter "Aziraphale posted on the Tirun board that there was a harass log filed against Azire. He didn't say who made it or why it was made, but he did start writing about how Azire was fussing at me for using inappropriate words on the newbie line. I want to know how he knew that there was a harass log started in the first place. The only people who should know are imms and admins. Now everyone's posting about it on the Tirun board, and out of respect for you, I'm not posting my side of the story. But at this moment, he's making me look like I've done something that I didn't do. That harass log wasn't started against Azire, it was just in case the newbie line got cleared before I'd have a chance to prove my case. Could you please clear this up with Aziraphale and everyone when you get back? Apparantly Azire has been going to other people and complaining about what happened, because Daos came at me the other day as if she was poking him about it and he wouldn't let up until he had some of the witnesses come and clear my name for me. What Azire did was very wrong, and now I feel like she's in a way, sending people after me and I think this all ties into the post I made on the Tirun board about useless imms.This is just crap. I dropped it for you, and it's being held on to for some reason. Aziraphale had no right to post about that, and I want to know how the hell he knew about it. An immortal obviously told him, and that was wrong.-jen"
