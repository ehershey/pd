__Letter "Hi, this is Rayna. I have been trying to find a way to tell you what hashappened to me. The situation between James and I ended because I losttrust in myself and was afraid to move on. The thing is that you were toocontrolling, and you didn't give me space to breathe, you wanted to controlmy body, and got angry at me when Iwouldn't comply.I ended up going with Nick, who beat me, assaulted me and I wouldn'thave done it normally. You sent me emails saying you still cared, eventhough you were with Katelyn. James was a saviour and I tried to makea go of things with him, but I couldn't trust enough to do it.My Dad died Dec 16 and the next day James ended things. I guess hecouldn't understand my reluctance to move on. You really hurt me andI never got over it.  We had something good and you lost it.Because of you, I had to try to gain my self-respect and self-confidenceback. But, the worst was being attacked by Nick and I did it as a rebound from you.I lost my Dad and James in two days and I blame myself for goingwith nick when I wouldn't have normally, but it was because of youthat I did it.  I will be on this mud but you won't know who I am, I really caredfor you.  Take care, byeRayna"
