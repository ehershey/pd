__Letter "Hey, how's it going?I've heard a lot of grumblings about swipe.  Here's my take.  I know you're the final say, boss.  But I've always felt you listen to me 'cause I'm not Aldur. heheSwipe is overpowered, for dragons and weimic.Let's put it this wayIt's dependent on strength, melee, and attack correct?What are the three things that dragons have in abundence?So it's no wonder they do insane damage with swipeWhat are the three things I do not have with bear?Attack is a BITCH to raise, over a million a pop at 70 out of 200. Melee is the same wayAnd druids don't need strengthSee? It's perfectly balanced for druids. The only way it would reach abusive is if I sunk about a billion xp into attack, melee, and strength which would mean it's worth itMy idea is to remove it from dragons/wiemics or tone it down for them. Make a seperate swipe for themKeep it the way it is in bears as I can tell you right now that I dont do all that much damage with it.If you want to test it with me, I'll be more then happy to demonstrateIn any case, keep the peaceOh! By the wayAnother balanceIt costs a lot of SPWhat is one thing druids don't have?SPThey don't need it so it's not like they spend a lot of time raising dex.Anyway, things to think about"
