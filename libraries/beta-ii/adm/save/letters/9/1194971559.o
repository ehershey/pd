__Letter "Well, as our schedules permit, we will be in each other's arms.  It seemsforever until we are together, doesn't it?I will be out for most of the day today, due to appointments, but I willcome on as soon as I can.  Until then, I will miss you immensely.As always, your loving joker-in-training.  I will never match up to yourwit, because you are a true jester.  I am Abbott to your Costello (or vice versa) heheI am butter to your bread.Yours always,Xeniaxoxo"
