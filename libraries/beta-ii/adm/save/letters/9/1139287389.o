__Letter "Hey Beautiful, how are you doing? I'm alright, your brother informed me that you are asleep, it's only 8:39 your time, you go to sleep really early!! But that's alright :). It's 10:40 my time and I'm getting ready to take a shower so I don't have to take one tomorrow morning. I hate having to get up so early to take a shower :( I'll still wash my hair tomorrow though, I can't stand my hair being all messy, lol. Oh I miss you so much already, it's not fair that we don't get to spend a lot of time together like we should :(. But I'm going to hang in there just because I know in a year, if I can, I'll fly down and see you. I can't wait until I do get to see you none the less. I love you so much and I hope you are having a good night's rest and sweet dreams. I hope tomorrow is a good day for you, I love you Simran.Forever yours,Josh(p.s. I'm going to try to mail you when I get up again but I'm not sure if I can, but none the less give me a mail sometime tomorrow telling me what time you think you're brother's game will be if he has one. I love you so much....bye for now Beautiful)"
