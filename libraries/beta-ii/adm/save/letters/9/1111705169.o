__Letter "corrupt, darkmist, demonbolt, demonfire, fear, hellfire, shadowburst, torment - Ok those are the abilities I have at level 36<corrupt> I have yet to even figure out what this does, I thought it was supposed to just drop someones alighment, but it also engages you in battle and does no damage at all. If you're going to give us an ability that lowers peoples alignments it's only useful if you can use it an ANY room on the mud, because it's not like someones just gonna let me sit there and follow them exp while i slowly drop thier alignment.<torment> this ability is basically magic missle, it's fine really <demonbolt> demonbolt and darkmist are the same exact spell, by the time you get them you dont need them anymore.<darkmist> another very low damage spells with a name like darkmist you think it would do more, but it doesnt. it's just another magic missle copy like torment and demonbolt<hellfire> i was so  stoked to get this, until I realized that at lvl 36 with my skills maxxed and over 280 stat total, it still takes about 10 rounds for this spell to kill a 25k mob. That was when I realized I could never finish playing this character.<fear> well it paralyzes your opponent, on a percentage that WOULD make it worth using, expect they're only paralyzed for that round, so if they're spamming faster than you it's likely they'll slash you, get thier idles in, THEN be paralyzed and the very next round the'll be slashing you again. Also it randomly makes your enemy run away... now why would you ever wanna make your enemy leave the room in pd? maybe adding a 1-3 round para on slightly smaller percentage and just totally get rid of the part that makes them flee. Or you could give them a different ability for making thier opponent run away, or make 2 syntax's for the same spell, something gotta change with fear.<demonfire> HALLELUJAH! I finally got this awesome ability i've heard soooo much about... gee whattya know, lvl 37, max skills, 280 stat total and it still takes me 6 rounds to kill a 25k.. also it only paralyzes newbies and sewer lvl 1 monsters.<shadowburst> oh yea, I forgot about this one... with good reason, i've used it a few times to exp and about 3 times in the arena, it made me angrier and angrier that i remorted each time i used it. heh<summon> heh, cmon you know how stupid it is :P<absorb> 10-12 rounds for a 25k,  nuff said<dakzhul> ok here's my biggest beef with the entire kataan class, they're supposed to be fighters and mages, thats why demons are the perfect choice, and thats why they have 2 physical attacks. ok Dakzhul has decent damage, but it takes 3 rounds to use, the first round you have to summon energy, the second round you hit, the third round you do damage and remain paralyzed.. Now this isnt as much of a problem for me, although still a problem.. because I am a demon and I can just gore.. I really think that you should be able to attack once your dakzhul lands, maybe you can only attack with a physical attack, or maybe you make it so you can only use a 1 or two of your spells, like demonfire or hellfire, other mage classes have combinations of spells they can cast FOR EXAMPLE[sorcerers] can cast staticshield, then another spell in the same round[necromancers] can cast deathtouch and chaoswave in the same round[monks] can supplicate 2 people, rub an oil AND crushingblow a monster all in the same roundI think just straight up changing the dakzhul so it works like a backstab or a crushingblow would be fine, it wouldnt make them into an unstoppable class by any means, it would make them into an exp'able class for sure<impale> well, i mean I dont use it, ever and every kataan i've talked to never uses it.. I think people should be able to make kataans kind of a warrior if they want, i definately think they need more projectile skill,, 6 per lvl seems fair since they pretty much HAVE to use a Kataan pike. Also I think taking 1 point from thier melee, and adding it to attack making it 5 attack per lvl and 3 melee per lvl would be better.<vortex> Ok, now I dont have this ability but I know that it's perfect and doesnt need to be tweaked at all. It probably does more damage than any spell in the game and it is an area attack, but even people in your party will be attacked by it so you always have to exp solo.. it's fineBasically the ONLY reason I even got to lvl 36 was because my stats were so high when I remorted, I have a lvl 36 mage, 36 necromancer, mazrim was a pyromancer for a long time and a level 20 wizard, they have all been more fun, less stressful and easier to play than kataan.  Now I'm not saying anything is too easy, i've had my difficulties with all of the classes, but all of them remained enjoyable, but Kataan really was a letdown.  I definately think they need to be improved more so than balanced. I've been playing on PD for about 4 years now , i 've made an elite in all but 6 subclasses at one point or another, If i ever decide to play dubbya again it will be after they're balanced or it will be to remort back to demon antipaladin..I've always prided myself on being able to exp faster than most of the people that mud, and with a lvl 36 sorc with shitty stats i can exp 5 times as fast than dubbya, who if not for his class would be buff in any other class with his stats.I hope this helps, if you need anything more specific just let me know i'd love to help you balance this class.Justin - Mazrim/Dubbya/Agent"
