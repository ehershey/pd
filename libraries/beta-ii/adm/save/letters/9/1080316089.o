__Letter "if you're on when i'm not, and i think you will be as your rarely on because of class these days and i'm sleeping more :P, Daos wants to talk to you or Whit. I think it'd be best if you talked to him, considering what Whit's last post on the newbie board said, i don't think Whit needs any more loads on himoh yeah, and i fixed the bugged shortstaff in /d/guilds/illuminati/weapon. it was making the player lose their heartbeat whenever it specialed, and i fixed it...its under /wizards/helena/staff.c if you want to have a look and move it over or whatever. but yeah, thats about it really. that and the disturbing posts on assassin and rogue i posted about on imm board."
