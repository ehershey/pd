__Letter "Hi, I tried to talk to James, but it doesn't really fix anything. Does heknow of my other alts? It doesn't matter though, just wondered.If I do make a new one, I'd like to keep it just with you, if that's okay.I probably won't use this one for quite awhile anyway, so when I do makea new one, I'll let you know. HugsRayna"
