__Letter "Kataan has a few serious bugs that can be abused right now.Fighting elder guardian for example hereCan make nightmares that the guardian will kill. The guardian gets exp for each nightmare it kills and loses life from the nightmare hits. Then when the player kills the guardian they get a huge ammount of exp (the guardian plus all the nightmare's).In addition corrupt is very very strong for kllin... can take mobs to -200 sp so they do no damage and cannot use abilitiesThese bugs make kataan unbalanced at low levels"
