__Letter "Berserks - could have warshouts that raise skills and stats for everyone in the party but while they are in combt they wont be able to run.pyromancers - they could get a flameshield or flamewall instead of bufffer would make them more interesting.assassins - a few cool moves like throatslit they are already good just need new commands.scouts - not sure but maybe a a good bow ability that could start combat so it won't be to strong or maybe some traps...just a few ideas "
