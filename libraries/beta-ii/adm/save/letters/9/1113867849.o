__Letter "this may sound kinda lame..i feel bad i was trying to blame mudding on the problems in my life and i suicided my 4 characters..Draven, Shadimar, Smite, and Shadow. heh. i realize now pd isn't my problem and well, i had a lot of issues goin on with my girlfriend and stuff. we had a huge argument. a few of my friends convinced me to ask you for my characters back but i dunno if u can do that. i'd understand if you can't..i regret it, but i'm known for it..and i tried to hold back but i just gave in and suicided. i love pd and everything it has become and well i really would appreciate it.take it easy stormy:)laters"
