__Letter "Hey... I've heard that Jekhar is killing in drows and he's somewhere between levels 25-30... I know from experience that this is for all intents and purposes impossible without bug abuse... he says he has a trick but wont say what it is. He is Mak's alt, and mak was found to be abusing bugs before so he's definetly not above it. If it could be looked into that would be awesome. Thx :)-- Ashram"
