__Letter "Once upon a time, there was an infant ferrel named Leonard Von Burbles. He thoroughly detested the name, but seemed to be stuck with it throughout his childhood.  As he got older, he began hanging around with a not-so-stellar type of crowd and began learning the art of thieving and burgling. One day his talents were noticed by an older thief, who, in a seeming act of kindness took young Leonard under his wing. The truth was, this thief, who went by the name of Treacle, was getting too elderly to do his own swiping and pilfering. A talented young thief was just what he needed. But that name! It was just outrageous and far too obvious. Treacle himself had forgotten his birth name long ago, and had been named due to his sticky fingers!  So Treacle continued instructing Leonard on his art while he considered a new name. He figured that the boy's particular talents would emerge and with them, a suitable name.Unfortunately, things don't always go the way we hope. Leonard's talent seemed to have plateaued, not showing extra strength or inclination in one particular direction, and his memorable name was attracting unwanted attention. Leonard and Treacle were forced to move from city to city to outrun the Law of the Land. Treacle even wondered if it wouldn't just be better to make a fresh start of it somewhere and, Immortals help him, toe the line and go straight. Just the thought weighed heavily on the older man's heart. Leonard couldn't bear to watch his old mentor in such pain and vowed to become superbly talented in some way. For, there -is- honor among thieves, as long as you are considered family, otherwise, you're just out of luck.Leonard, hoping to draw attention away from poor old Treacle, kept moving on his own, periodically sending back funds from his fenced goods. He tried everything, standard burgerlary, running cons, picking pockets. He had a fairly successful run of three card monty for a time. It just wasn't enough. Then one day it happened. He took note at how careless other adventurers tended to be with their bags. Maybe this could be it! So he tried, and his fingers were exceptionally light. He knicked that bag without even a brushing sensation against the other adventurer. He spent the rest of his day doing this and was thrilled that he'd found a profitable talent that he was wonderful at. Leonard returned to his old mentor, Treacle, only to find him very ill and on his deathbed. Leonard was very sad because he had wanted to give his old friend some time of adventure before he moved on to the next world. Even as he was dying Treacle was very proud of his student and told him that he should be known forever more as Bagger. So the newly named Bagger, stayed by his mentor's side until the day he died, and knew he would never call himself Leonard Von Burbles ever again. That person no longer existed. All that was left was the young ferrel thief named, Bagger.The end"
