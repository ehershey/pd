__Letter "Darling, I went on a journey today with your cousin, Necron. kIt was quite the adventure, we travailed to Lodos by carriage. The creatures there are quite different then they are here, they seem to have a great security system there. We walked deep into the land, where we came across an evil creature, that took your cousin down. After witnessing your cousin being slain, I was able to leave the room, clinging to my last breath. I was not able to save your cousin from such a disaster. I had to escape, leaving his fallen body behind. He of course was spared by the grim reaper. What a lucky soul. Although the trip to Lodos was a dangerous one, I had quite the time exploring with your cousin... till his fall. I do plain to go there again sometime. You are such a loving and understanding husband, when it comes to my experience in this land. Love, I am working my way up to you, we will soon be able to explore the lands together. Love,<~`~{@ Empyrean @}~`~>"
