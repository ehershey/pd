__Letter "hello, i am here to talk to you about daos and why he should be an admin, in my openion no one deserves to become and admin more then daos. I spoke to a couple of people on the mud that weren't idle at the time. Furion, Elmo, Kai and Lac said they would like to see daos as an admin, the other person i spoke to was Zeus who was not sure because he does not know daos very well. One reason why i believe daos should be an admin are he is on more then alot of people, the second is he has been an immortal for a long time which means he has alot of experience, and third is if he was to become an admin he could be of more help to everyone. he said to me he cannot fix things because he did not have the power to and the people i have named i sure will agree with what i have said. well that is all i have to say.thank you for spending the time and reading this, and i hope you consider about daos and becoming an admin.Galdur."
