__Letter "As we are not short on disk space, there is no reason to imposelimits on the number of messages or folders anyone can have.As for 'cleaning up the player mail objects', I'm not even surewhat you're talking about. The mailbox object which would need touse restore_object()/save_object() can simply be remove()d whenyou're done with it. It won't be any noticeable amount of lag."
