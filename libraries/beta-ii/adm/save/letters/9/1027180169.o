__Letter "I was wondering about if you had made an archangel/demon character, but wanted to start again as one. Would you be allowed to start with an archangel/demon at Level 1 with rolled stats, as long as the other character was removed?I was wondering because I *have* made an archangel, and I would like to be one again simply for the 'having', since I don't play competitively anymore. I just don't really want to waste 2 weeks of my life getting a character to lvl50, just to go back and start where I am now.Idea for what an archangel is now:They once where the most powerful beings of Primal Darkness, but after they were severed from their gods e.t.c, I have the history I made up written down somewhere. Anyway, after it all they hid in the human cities in the temples as clerics, paladins and monks, as they still had much divine power. (They can hide their wings to pass themselves off as humans). Still, they did not give up hope, and eventually made their own temple where they could stay together, and work towards re-establishing their link.However, with the passing of time their numbers began to dwindle as they discovered their new mortality, and died of old age. So they set up a series of trials for the faithful of other temples. If a person passes the trials he receives the prayers of the archangels, and becomes one. (Why a character can make an archangel)breatheThey are given this history of the archangels, and their objective to remake the link. They also receive training in the path of their choice, to harness their new abilities. (Archangel classes. [Templar/Archaeon/Mystral] [Tem-plar/Ar-kay-on/Mis-tral] [Clergy/Fighter/Mage].They are no longer truly immortal, however, due to their ancestry and divine nature, they gain the benefit of increased fortitude, stamina and mental power (more hp/sp/mp than normal classes), making them hard to kill.Hmm, well I can't keep thinking about stuff, it may be better for conversation than mail. So - I have ideas for the advantages and disadvantages of being archangel. - Aziraphale"
