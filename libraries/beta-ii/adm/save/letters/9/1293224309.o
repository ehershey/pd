__Letter "I would like to take a crack at reworking the sky, water surface and ocean depth system.Quite simply the sky will have + numbers, thesurface being 0 and the ocean depths being -numbers. I would keep track of it all in amapping within a daemon. Each location wouldbe tracked with the height (or y in the x,y,zformat)being the first key in the mapping.Another mapping would be the value for thosekeys. The key for the inner mapping would be({x,z}) for the width and depth dimentions.the value for the inner mapping would be whoor what is at that location. Once that locationis empty, it gets deleted from the daemon'smapping. ([\"height\":({width,depth}):([location content: ({ passengers, objects onboard, etc }) ]) ])"
