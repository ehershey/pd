__Letter "I can help with coding new things to do with Kingdoms, and forgo playing in that time. I'll also be able to not let things slip.I actually had a nifty idea when I heard of Kingdoms, and that would be a re-do of the money system. Rather than just having types of coins, you could have each kingdom have it's own money system. ie \"Zimelia\" has \"Gold Crowns\" \"Silver Helms\" \"Copper Caps\" - and their gold coins can be a different worth to the gold coins of other Kingdoms. That could make trade a bit more interesting.So, yeah."
