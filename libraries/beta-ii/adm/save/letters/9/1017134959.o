__Letter "A great amount of RP? What has Leviathas got to do with this? What portion of tha game, and what the hell did you pass on to me?. \"Not everything you do or say is MEANT but it PLAYING.\" That doesn't even make sense.I don't care if levi was here at the beginning of primal darkness. I don't care who was here at the first because I wasn't.Oh, and I know you guys know more about PD than I do, but I don't really care. I decided to play here because some of my friends played here, and we were going to become archangels and set up a guild. I don't play to know more about the mud than other people. I play to advance my character, and interact with the players.Hmmmm, you know more about what than me? What exactly does 'more then that' mean anyway? Either you were sending that message to someone who is as bad at grammar as you are, or you are one of those people that like to go fast and loose with spelling and grammar. It doesn't help when the person you are writing to can't even read what you have written.	- Aziraphale says \"FFS why does everyone try and make themselves look bigger than me?\""
