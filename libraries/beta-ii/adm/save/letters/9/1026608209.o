He claims to have complete    memory of this time period and singlehandedly founded the     Unholy, a guild devoted to Asmodeus and the demons.  Leviathas    claimed that an extremely talented Kataan by the name of     'Wildflower' was the princess of hell and made her a co owner    of the guild.  While his past is something of a mystery to     most, rumor has it that he was tortured and abused and left    to die on the island of Merkerri where he raised himself since    the age of three.  His life has been full of pain and misery    and many believe that this has pushed him to insanity.[*]----------------------------------------------------------------[*]        "
