__Letter "Hi, I was doing stuff to you while you were in the square, you werecloaked.   heheI got disconnected from the mud, came on and everyone in the squarewas link-dead and it said something about being in a freezer.When I typed last newbie, it said invalid line and i couldn't say anythingon the newbie line at all.Strange....I guess you're asleep, hope to talk to you tomorrow some time.Hopefully we can have a loooong talk on chat line soon.hugs"
