__Letter "I would like to become a staff on Pd - II. If i do become one, i may want flash to be one, for one reason or another, but i also may want pyro to be it, whichever one you would like. My interests are with coding things, i really love computers and video games, and i want to know as much as i can about coding, on any level, because i want to code video games one day. I know how to code any basic rooms, i know how to code more basic rooms, i know how to code mobs, and i know how to make a pre-exit-funcion, how to make an item that can do something, and also if you are going into a room how to make the text lines go slower and make them paralized, for instance, jumping off a roof, sending a few text lines, and making them paralized \"you are too terrifired\". I do not know how to make the actuall player interaction stuff, like making new commands, but i am willing to learn, and i can learn quickly. If need be, i can even make a new character to be an immortal, that noone ever heard of, like that one \"luna\" person. Uhh.. now for the short blurb on why i would be a good immortal, i can learn quickly, i already know the basics, and a few beyond. and.. ermm... *pauses for thought*... i wouldnt mind holding any position you would put me in. typo person, law, room coder, whatever you want.Oh yeah, another reason why i want to be an immortal is also when i code, i wont freeze all the time and get kicked off, so i can code a lot faster, and also there will be other people on, and i like talking to other people, if they want to talk to me.In conclusion, i would really like to be a addition to your fine staff, Amen. (i didnt know what else to put there, theres a word that closes a statement, but i forgot what is it)                                                                        %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^~%^RESET%^%^RED%^P%^BOLD%^y%^RESET%^%^RED%^r%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^"
