__Letter "There is a monster coded for level 2-3 (the second section of my area) that runs a trivia quest. The questions/answers are stored in an array in a header file and a mapping called quiz_track([]) keeps the records about the players progress.This is the layout for quiz_track ...      quiz_track(\"score\",\"quiz\"(\"question\",\"answer\"))Of course i didn't use mapping format here but this shows how it's layed out better.What Quessalaz does is gives the question.. when the answer is given then quiz_track[pname][\"quiz\"] is set to 0 and 1 added to quiz_track[pname][\"score\"] to conserve memory.My question, now that you understand how he works, is i have written an extra func() on quessalaz to check a player's score and one on his room to access the func() stored on quessalaz. I CAN access them just fine however. I am having a hard time getting the system to LOAD Quessalaz's room without someone physically walking into it.Is there a way for me to make one room call another room into being??Right now i have set_no_clean(1); in Quessalaz's room so once he is activated he is always going to be loaded..... but im sure there is a simpler way.Nesoo said to load quiz_track into each room that needs it but then we would have 7 differnet copies of this mapping loaded into memory (one for each spot that needs to test quiz_track) and considering he remembers EVERYONE's score quiz_track can grow quite large rather quickly. Hence i only want ONE copy of it in memory and let the others read THAT copy.Please help me when you got a moment Boss.  I just need to know what commands to use if one room CAN turn another one on without someone entering it to activate it. Then i can remove the set_no_clean(1) and let the system load and unload the room as needed.Ironman"
