__Letter "I was reading some crap for my Mark Twain class when you sentyour messages. :( I turned and saw your name, got excited andsaw you gone and got de-excited. Please send an im next time asit has a tone and will alert me that you're there? Class is inless than 2 hours so it's a brief window.See you soon, I hope...Ax"
