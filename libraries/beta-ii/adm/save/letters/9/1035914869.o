__Letter "One of my old muds formally called zhing which is now called zynna, is going to try and add an arena.  Its something thats long over due for that place.  Only problem is that the current Immortals and Admins are lazy ass's and will never get around to coding such a thing.  I was wondering if maybe you could help me out by maybe showing me how to code just an arena for that mud.  If I gave them an already coded arena then im sure they wouldnt have a problem adding it.  I wouldnt even bother with it all if it werent for that mud being my first.  Your first always holds a special place in yourself.  When you read this maybe we could chat about it.                                                           Really seeking your help,                                                               Shinkoro"
