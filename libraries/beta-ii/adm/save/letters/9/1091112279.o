__Letter "Hels, It has always been a pleasure to share your company. You and Tsuke both. I understand that the situation at hand leaves us with very little comfort zone to be friends right now. Its fine if it wont work. Time is the only healer of wounds like this - i should know, this has happened many times before. Its one of the reasons I dont like myself very much. It has to be some fault in me that people keep hurting themselves on me. Does that makes sense? maybe not.. but its something that haunts me and terrifies me each time i discover that someone has feelings for me. I dont want you to forget what happened to David - I dont want anything to just disappear. I'm not naieve and I'm very aware of the pain he is going through right now. Fault and Blame aside its a shitty thing. I hate it. I feel it - and always will, because in the end its cost me another friend, and possibly more friends thereafter. I do have to stick up for myself and state - however - that even before the final words had fallen, David was changing around things i had said to him concerning my feelings. I know he's dealing with depression. Its a fairly common symptom. I'm not calling him a liar - I just HAVE to clarify that you know you're not getting the whole picture from him right now. that's all..I dont want to lose any of you. But if i can't have my cake and eat it too , lets just not be enemies.~Jenna"
