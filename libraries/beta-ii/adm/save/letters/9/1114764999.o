__Letter "As a side note I would like to say that I have not cheated to get to where any of my chacters have gotten to today.  I have never done anything before, never done anything to where my characters should be deleted or even have things taken from them.  I suggest taking away gold from me, seeing how that is what I was doing.  I feel that that would be a fair punishment.  That is just my thoughts.Thank you."
