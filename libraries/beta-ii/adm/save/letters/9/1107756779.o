__Letter "I was thinking of picking a day when there is hardly any unholy active and update the room and have wildflower sleeping inside the room.  Inside the room there will be a large piece of gem that will be placed in her tiara, but it will be on the floor.  Hopefully nobody touches it, but if someone does, WF will be greatly angered by it and will magically grab the gem from someone's inventory and she will place it in.  Now, I will have full rage on that person, and that person will have to do A LOT to be in her favor again.  What I was thinking of doing is having different items affect the storyline of how she will relate *test of faith*  Maybe if someone had a corpse of an angel to sacrifice...etc...I will await what you think, I don't want to be too harsh with your guild...but I have a feeling that I will be in comitition with someone.Oh, also in the room there will be an altar already placed, and if I can get the code, demons popping in and whispering to wf like her descript says....I would love to make it as authentic as possible"
