__Letter "Dearest Eliza, I am so moved by your words. It has a poetic soulwhether it rhymes or no. I am glad you feel the same way I do. There can simply be no other for me. You take up permanent residence in my heart and you take vacations in my mind, all thewhile traveling through my soul. I will have the happiest Valentine's Day imaginable, I am sure, come wht may. :) Thankyou, thank you, thank you. :)Forever and always yours,Amaki"
