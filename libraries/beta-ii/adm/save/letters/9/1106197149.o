__Letter "hey man, how's it going? i haven't seen you in awhile but you apparently were on-line recently..smokey aka pimp daddy said he was pretty good friends with you..and told me to ask you for a favor..apparently, my alt Draven can't go druid because he's demon..YET...druid's only lose replace when they go evil (Ceril tested this out cause he's an evil druid). i could see why a cleric or monk can't go demon but a druid..is sort of neutral and stuff. i was wondering..if you can make draven a druid for me..if you could that'd totally rock. i've been planning this out for awhile now"
