__Letter "I play merentha but I'm not Petrarch.As I recall it was you PD people who all threw a hissy fit when you thought they scopied the partyrange command.  It was your pathetic players which spammed Merentha.I see no such spam here from them, even though they have 100 times the number of players you do.It looks to me like PD players are the insecure ones.  Such a small person you must be too to send threatening mails like you do.  Pathetic to say the least."
