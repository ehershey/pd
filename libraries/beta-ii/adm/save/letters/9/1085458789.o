__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Daboura to Nightshade Sat May 15 06:13:28 2004:-----I know you hate any guild related topics, but I feel you are the only one I can talk to this about.I think whit has let the guild system run out of control, I am seeing new weapons that are way too powerful. I would be very happy to give up the few items I do have in my guild just to see some sense of balance restored. I have been talking with ven, and he agrees with me about the balancing problem. I really think this needs to be looked at. To me, the whole guild system seems to be spinning out of control. and I really hate to see 1 guild becoming a dominate power because they happen to have th most influence over an Imm/admin and are able to get anything they want coded for them that will unbalance everything.I'm sorry about bothering you about this.... but I feel that whit has not handled the guild system in a proper manner."
