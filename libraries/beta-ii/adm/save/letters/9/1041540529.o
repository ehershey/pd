__Letter "	Alexia Canon woke up on June 23 just like every other morning. She got up, looked in her mirror, went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and get dressed, and then went downstairs for breakfast. Although this particular morning was a little different, when she went downstairs she nearly jumped about ten feet in the air as her mother yelled, \"Happy birthday.\" She had made her favorite chocolate chip pancakes like she did every morning on her birthday, which was her favorite part. As she sat down to eat, her father came downstairs, he grabbed some juice, said goodbye, then left to go to work. This may seem like an ordinary family, but truthfully, it was not. Alexia was a witch; she was just like the rest of her family. Some of the finest witches and wizards had come out of her family. In fact her uncle, James McFraud, was the     headmaster at the school that she is going to attend, Martwardtz Academy for young witches and wizards. Every witch or wizard in her family had attended Martwardtz, it was established by one of the greatest witches that the magic world had ever seen, Henrietta Martwardtz.	After Alexia had finished her breakfast and thanked her mother, she went into the den to read a few of the books she was assigned for school. But, soon all of her thoughts were quickly interrupted when an owl came swooping down onto the table in front of her. \"Hello Angelina, you bring something for me?\" Angelina was one of the family owls; they had about twenty or so. She dropped a package and a letter on the table then flew off to the owlery upstairs. \"I wonder what this could be,\" muttered Alexia. Since it had no name on it, she didn't know whom it was from. When she opened it, she found a picture album with the name Vampira Dawn on the cover. "
