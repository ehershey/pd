__Letter "You get to playtest a dragon.  You need to play at least a substantial amount so balance can be done between types of dragons and other classes.  I need you to make a new character with no class or subclass, and mail me back with the name of the character.  I'll then assign you to a dragon race and type of my choosing.  If you've changed your mind, just send me a mudmail saying so.  Remember, you will not get to keep your dragon character after playtesting is over.  You'll have to figure out the quest just like everyone else.                                  -Nightshade"
