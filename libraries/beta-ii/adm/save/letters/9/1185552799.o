__Letter "all i can remember this time around is it allows me to log in but as soon as i hit any command usually its who or look, it says 0, i exit out of the window log back in and it says reconnected and i hit a command says 0 again. I now realize that each time i come in i lose some eq, the first time it happen i tried a lot of times to get back in and lost everything,yesterday and today i only tried three times to get in failing twice before acutally getting in. I pray it doesnt happen again but if it does I will make a detail copy.Yetron"
