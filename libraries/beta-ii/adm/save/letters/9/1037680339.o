__Letter "I notice you are the leader of the Unholy. Well darksouls are evil but not evil enough. I want a guild that lives for violence and it seems yours is the place to go. All the other guilds are a bunch of wanna-be badasses. Am I evil? I'm a demon kataan. It doesnt get more evil than that. So if you are looking for an addition to your guild let me know. Make me council to take care of day to day stuff (Murder, extortion, stealing, raping, pillaging ect). Dont know if you want people in there or not but if your guild is as evil as its made out to be I'd like to be in it.Rubicante the Lord of Evil"
