__Letter "Hi it's CaspI had enough faith in you to deal with that, and would have left it up to you to handle it anyway you wanted, whether desting or just wizkill.but what they did was wrong as far as i can see, i left Mer to get away from Testorone filled children.I understand that this balancing is extremely stressful, Paul has been talking to me about it tooYou are a great Admin, and this is a great mud, You have done really well, i just hate it being wrecked by other players arroganceSo if that player and all his friends never come back here, or after i talk to Paul i never come back here, it isn't your fault, i don't know anyone who has tried as hard as you haveYou have produced a fantastic mud, shame about the people that think they run itCasp."
