__Letter "A professor of mathematics sent a fax to his wife. It read:Dear Wife:You must realize that you are 54 years old, and I have certain needs whichyou are no longer able to satisfy. I am otherwise happy with you as wife,and I sincerely hope you will not be hurt or offended to learn that by thetime you receive this letter, I will be at the Grand Hotel with my18-year-old teaching assistant. I'll be home before midnight.Your Husband\"When he arrived at the hotel, there was a faxed letter waiting for him thatread as follows:Dear Husband:You, too, are 54 years old, and by the time you receive this letter, I willbe at the Breakwater Hotel with the 18-year-old pool boy. Being thebrilliant mathematician that you are, you can easily appreciate the factthat 18 goes into 54 a lot more times than 54 goes into 18.Don't wait up.\"/"
