__Letter "Argh. not having gmud is really starting to annoy me. It's whatever is wrong with my computer that's causing gmud to tak e so long to finally start working. *groan* I'm gonna hate to do it, but next weekend I'm gonna ask my dad to fix my computer. Not only is gmud not working, but now PSP isn't working. Blah. I thought i would at least be able to play around there while i was waiting for gmud to work.Anyway, this is really starting to get annoying. I think i'm gonna go play a computer game for a while, and maybe bty the time I'm done, gmud will be working or at least psp. I'll try to be on before you leave for work, though i will likely be on sooner than that.I love you,Heather"
