__Letter "Hey there, baby. I'm just writing this to let you know about when I'll be on pd. Since tomorrow is the weekend, I can't be online unless it's at nighttime for me. So Sat and Sun, I'll probably be on about 10pm my time (about 1pm your time i think). But during the week I should be able to be on a little bit in the mornings (though it would require that I get up earlier than usual). Pretty much nights are better for me. I don't know what your work schedule is like, but I guess I'll see you when I see you. *Savannah comes up and kisses you passionately before winking and fading to the shadows*"
