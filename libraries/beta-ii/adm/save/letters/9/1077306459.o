__Letter "I think we're not friends because he was being stupid on the newbie line so I told him I wasn't going to talk to him anymore or something along those lines. Anyway, basically I'm just tired of being friends with a kid I guess. He's one of the most immature people I know on PD (or in general), and I tried really hard to tolerate him, I gave him many chances and whatnot....I don't hate him or anything, and I'd be willing to be friends with him again for some reason, I just can't stay mad/irritated/etc at anyone I guess. But, I do wish he'd grow up some. Although, this is just a game, so it's okay to 'play'...I just wish he knew that there is a time for immaturity and a time for maturity...Sorry he's out to get you. There's nothing I can do about that. Thankfully he isn't a rogue, so you'll at least be able to see him coming.Take Care,Jen"
