__Letter "Toss my hat into the ring for that post.I would have no problem designing and running quests and events.As for a resume, You need to look no further than my work in my area'squests to see how dementedly hard i can make the quests. The prizeswould reflect the difficulty of the quests. Easier the quest weaker theprizes.I'm not even going to comment on the coding experiance requirement bud :)You've seen what i can do when im giving access to get the job done. Thesecurity system i set up on builders solved most of the issues you havehad with past builders and made it so builders can easily work in teams now.Please consider me for the post of quest immortal.Ironman"
