__Letter "Honestly, the color system for dragons, although more common, is kind of overdone and lame in my mind.  I think perhaps, after balance is done, dragons could be changed to either be elements (fire frost/ice shadow/earth water, red white black blue) or even a really original idea of stones (ruby, sapphire, onyx, diamond) and they wouldn't really need new abilities so much as renamed abilities to fit in the new theme.  It's just something I thought could make PD a bit more unique."
