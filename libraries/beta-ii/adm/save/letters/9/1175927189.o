__Letter "Don't worry about Kazuma, I 'cided him because I figure that Alexander should be my main. And the reason for it was because Joker and Arma live near me, and sometimes they would log online and bother me, saying I was gay/fag for still playing and ignore would never work because each time they came on it was a different name, so that's why I wanted the change. They know I'm Alexander as well, but as of late they really haven't been bothering me as much. But if they do I will probably ask for this name to be changed as well.Thank you,Alexander"
