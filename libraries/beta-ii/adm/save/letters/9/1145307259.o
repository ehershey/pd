__Letter "Hello, my character \"Null\" has been arrested because i refused to suicide him. I asked the admin why i had to suicide he said that my name was innapropreate. I find this confusing because there had been several admins on while i was using this character, and none had said anything. I refused and told him i had put too many hours into the character and would not suicide. I said he was welcome to dest me, but i would take it up with you. He chose to arrest me.If you force me to change the characters name, just dest him for me, i dont want him if i have to change the name. Looking forward to your speedy reply. Thank you for your time."
