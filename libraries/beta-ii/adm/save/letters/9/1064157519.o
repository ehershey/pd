__Letter "yeah, i kinda feel obligated to see the boy. It's been 4 years... My wits are holding up alright. I finished a huge project for class (the line thing).. i hand inked over 500 frikking lines! >_<  With that out of the way i'm feeling better. *puff* i've got lots of support from mayuki,amanda and celeste - as well as from you, so if'n i DO feel strange after seeing him, i'm confident that i can remedy the situation quickly. I'll be around tomorrow... unless i get ditched today (which might very well happen.) .~I've got a peaceful, easy feeling.. and i know you wont let me down~Jenna"
