__Letter "yay!  mail from jenna ^_^  I've missed you too.  but I guess this is a poor time for both of us to get together because we're both so busy.  I see on the post you made that your car broke down.  Mine did too, last night.  (some of the cylinders arent firing)  I'm going to try and fix it today.  BUT!  I am looking into getting a new car, and I sent an email to a dealer saying I can get a loan for 5-6k if this auction doesnt go through for him: http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&category=6350&item=2457387795&sspagename=STRK%3AMEBWA%3AIT      *grins with glee*  it'll be great ;)  Anyway....  thanks for the email, and hopefully I'll catch you on sometime (or give you a call ;) )                  -Paul"
