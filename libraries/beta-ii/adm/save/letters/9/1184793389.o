__Letter "When I logged on this morning around 10am est, I got hit with some kind of funky bug. When I logged back in just now, 5:13pm est, all my eq. was gone. I had 4 pumpkins and 4 diamonds thanks to Nemo's recent generosity. I also had various other weapons and armour but they don't mean as much to me. Hopefully, you could find some way to restore these to me?Thanks for any help you can give.Iksrtfo"
