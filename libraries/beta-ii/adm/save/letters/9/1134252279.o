__Letter "Spade,I think that Daboura is trying very hard to organize and structure the MUD.  It's a tough job.  We still value player input and I wont let that change.  But we have to ignore certain things, i.e. mountains of non-constructive complaints.  When we get stupid feedback like 'this is b.s. im leaving', the only appropriate response is no response at all.Anyway, I'm not fully clear on what you dislike about how things are being done right now, but I'd be happy to discuss it with you if you can fill me in on details.  Remember that few things are set in stone, and if you present your case politely, then I'd be glad to consider it or suggest it to the higher-ups.  The key though is that if you present yourself in the form of an attack rather than a polite criticism, then I probably wont care what you have to say.Levi"
