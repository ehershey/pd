__Letter "Ok, There will be a couple of upgrades...First thing, the Ocean now supports 2 more types of terrain, Ice and Coral Reefs.  The symbols have been added to the key inside the daemon.Ship Upgrades:  Cannons and Armour.  Armour helps to counteract cannons, and the higher cannon levels are, the faster they hit the boat and the more dmg they do.  So, A boat with a level 1 cannon, can do 1-4 dmg to another ship, not saying how much armour the other ship has either.  Ships come default with 33 hp, it goes up the more armour you get.You will be able to upgrade your speed, this is to help evade attacks by cannons, and to travel as well.P.S.  Also, Ice acts like land, you cant go there.  Coral Reefs put just another describ in the boat when you look at it.Whit"
