__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Wraith to Leviathas Mon Mar 25 18:29:38 2002:-----Listen you little newbie, I obtained a great amount of RP know how from leviathas about this portion of the game, and most of it was passed on to your stupid character. listen up and you might find that not everything we do or say is MEANT but it PLAYING. Levi was here at the BEGINNING of primal darkness and is 100 times smarter about this mud and what goes on here then I do , and I know more then that where YOU are concerned."
