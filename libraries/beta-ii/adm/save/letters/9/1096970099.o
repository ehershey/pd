__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Bellos to Abaddon Tue Oct  5 05:32:29 2004:-----Do you look at the world around you, this world of Primal Darkness, and feel sick to see all these infidels going about like they own the place?Do you want to see the world be as it is meant, under the Dark Lord's influence?Would you love the oppertunity to be able to cause a revolution, and overthrow the Angel's and all their kind from their high seats?If being a part of my Dark Lord's service to cleanse this realm interests you.  Catch me when i am around the area, or leave me a note at the post office.  And we can talk about...our dark future.%^GREEN%^~*~ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^Bellos - Demon Warlord of the %^RED%^Nether%^BLACK%^ Realm%^RESET%^GREEN%^ ~*~"
