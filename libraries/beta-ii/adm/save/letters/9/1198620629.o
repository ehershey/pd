__Letter "Merry Christmas!!! I am free from my festivities in NYC and backhome. I have to work tonight, so I will try to be on at the customary time. I hope you have a wonderful, happy, holiday filledwith love and joy and junk. Well, maybe not junk. Or junk can standfor all the nice miscellaneous things that we hope the holidays hold for us. Anyway, enjoy the junk with all my loe on top. :)Take care and just enjoy your day. :)Love,James"
