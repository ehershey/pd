__Letter "Few quick little other balance notes:Dragon breath paras a bit much from exping with smite. 40% like demonfire would be good.Swashbuckler's bladedance is a little cheap on sp. My bladedance at 37 does more than slash and it costs near nothing.For the higher exp mobs here are my recommendations:100k drow archers110k members of cavalry (they get double the attacks of archers about)130k soldiers (slash and rush hurt and they have 20% more hp and more normal attacks)+15k on the soldiers of malcon/macbeth's army.  They are high hp, ability using, swarm mobs. Very dangerous.Purg townsman/children are set at 5.5k and 8k at the moment. I recommend their normal ammounts.Purg guards. 75k. ability users with strong weapons.Purg skeleton guards. 150k. Ungodly ammount of hp and very strong attacks.Purg king/queen 300k. strongest mobs in the gamePurg advisor 100k. lots of strong spells and high hpBarbarian warmaster 150k - ability using raknid of lvl 80"
