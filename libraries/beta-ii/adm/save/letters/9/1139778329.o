__Letter "There's a bug with grep on the builder port. If you know the exact path and name of a file, you can get a copy of it, even if you aren't allowed access to that directory. Example:grep .* /std/user.c > ~/user.cI don't feel confident enough to even think of trying to tackle something like that, involving who has access to what and so forth, and apparently NS was made aware of it ages ago, so... I pass the torch to you :)"
