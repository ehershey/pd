__Letter "Hey man, was good getting acquainted with you this morning. Couldn't help but notice that you're not a paladin anymore. I could terrorize the mud if I had a good sorc in range. If you're interested, level to 55. You'll never take damage and we'll devestate pretty much the whole mud. Think about it, nobody ever wants to level into range, but when they do they're glad they did. Lvl 55 then stat like a mofo. My comp is down and out kinda, so I'm out of commission for a couple days, but ask Amaki or Geddoe about leveling into my range.smokey"
