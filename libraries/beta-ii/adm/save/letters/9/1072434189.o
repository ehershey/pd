__Letter "hrmmm.. was thinking about getting custom wing armour. Etherial (sp?) wings. Not very good with descriptions :/ The wings are large and translucent giving off a faint blueish glow, and just generally look cool. :P hrmmm... if possible, would you be able to make it so that i can fly while wearing them, or that they at least don't para when wearing/removing. thank you :D :) :)"
