__Letter "I know this may seem like a first, but I do apologise a lot.Yesterday was not a good day for me, and I think I took out a lot of anger on you at a time when you needed my friendship instead.I deeply regret what I've said to you and ask for you to accept my apology.If you do not, I understand, but I feel as if I've wronged you in a large way without even knowing a single thing of what was happening.I'm not saying you or Soulfly were right or wrong, I'm simply saying that I *do* like you... I just was being a total dipshit yesterday."
