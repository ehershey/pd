__Letter "Ok, he is absolutely not allowed in the guild now.He hugely slanted my position.I told him that personally, I wanted him to burn in hell, but if he could convince both you and Set to want him back in the guild, then I'd discuss it with you, but that I wouldn't even consider his membership unless both of you were askijng me to let him back in.Then he gave me an ulktimatum.  He said that if I didn't let him back in the guild, he may kill our members.Sorry if the message is a bit garbled.  I am typing from my mom's laptop on the site's telnet thing and can't see what I type.Merry AChristmas.Levi"
