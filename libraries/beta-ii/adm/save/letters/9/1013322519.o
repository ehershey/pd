__Letter "The Under-world TreatyDark Souls, Unholy, Forsaken1.      Only Guild members from the three guild will know of this treaty2.      Inter-guild PK is Illegal unless agreed upon by all three Guild leaders.3.      Inter-guild grievances/crimes will be brought to the attention of all Guildleaders and/or council members. Punishments will be decided on.4.      All three guilds will abide by these rules, with only the Leaders andcouncil gathering together.Treaty ranks:Leader- Wraith, Wildflower, Ashram/Dryfus - Will have judicial and disciplineprivileges.Enforcer - Faust - Enforces the rules of the treaty and the laws of their ownguilds. There will be one from each guild who will be council members of theirguilds.Well this is what I wrote up last night, let me know if I left anything outLevi, this is from Wraith, I don't know why, but he ommitted your name, he said somethingabout you never being on, and when you are on you are idled and unreachable.  I like the treaty and I don't.  part 3 needs a little bit more added on, I told them that what happens in unholy that dosn't affect the other two guilds, should be a guild punishment not a treaty punishment, he agreed.  Also, it has the part of enforcer,  I want a bettername for our guild, besides I don't have anyone worty enough for the position as of today.If the enforcer is a council position...would it be too much to ask if I had a leaderposition as discussed earlier, if I have it already please let me know.  How do I addpeople into the guild?I now have instant messenger pd808wildflower, I'll try and log on from the net more oftenI am hoping to get going on my coding, expand the mud and fix this treaty.  It seems a little on the short side.Wraith is looking into getting a council room for just our three guilds, also he wantsto get the leaders of the guild a treaty line so that we be in contact with the leadersof the other guilds at all times.  This might prove very useful later when the mud getsthe clicks going.  Wraith said that he would pay for the room.OH!!! type help unholy, stormbringer added the line about the role playing.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do.Wildflower"
