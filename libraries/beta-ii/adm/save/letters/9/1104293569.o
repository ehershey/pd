__Letter "i just thought i should vouch for nulvect. i've mudded with him for 7-8 years and he is a great mudder. he is also a great coder. and most of all he is very experienced on this mud..he's been here since the beginning and also has over 30 characters therefore knows each class probably better then anyone.in my opinion daboura has set back progress, not make primal progress..i vote nulvect :I i know he could have the mud completely balanced in little time."
