__Letter "Faust,You know what?  You are what we call a \"griefer\".  You live to make other people suffer and we've already lost a few players because of you.  Well guess what?  I wont be a victim.Who the fuck are you to say I didn't put any work in?  While you were PLAYING the game (playing is not working) I was building stuff for the mud or helping with new ideas or balance.  So push me around if you want to: it wont get you anywhere and I'm not going to leave like the other people you target.Levi"
