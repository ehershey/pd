__Letter "Hey,Coming from an old player who has been here since the start.... its time to let the mud go.No one actually plays anymore. Most people sit and idle and have triggers to log them on. Every now and then a few new start and soon quit from the lack of activeity.The mud has been dying for years and the players attitudes have further it lately. Its not fair for you to have to pay money and put time in on a mud that isn't played or even valued by many. Thank you for all you have done,-- Vyce"
