__Letter "11. Scripting while away from the keyboard is not allowed. If you are going    to play you must be at the keyboard while doing anything. If you are not    at your keyboard, your character should be idle. There are no exceptions    to this rule. Breaking this rule will lead to character deletion. If you    are out exping, you need to be actively participating.  If your computer    is exping for you, that is scripting regardless of where you physically    are and subject to punishmentif you are going to keep the last sentance of this rule, then you need to change the rule. Make the rule state that ALL scripting is not allowed, instead of just AFK scripting being bad.Without the last sentance, it says that you can script as long as you are at your computer and participating, just bad to be afk and scripting. So it would be helpful to take out the first 2 sentances and move the last sentance to the beginning"
