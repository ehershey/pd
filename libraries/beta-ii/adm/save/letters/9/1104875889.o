__Letter "I just accidently stumbled apon a bug... here it is.I was training stealth, and i was waking back and forth with a macro to go w;e, and it seemed like after a bit stealth turned off, so i added stealth on in the macro. But when i did this, it trained my stealth abnormally fast... seems that you can 'stealth on' multiple times to gain the skill quicker with walking.Endy."
