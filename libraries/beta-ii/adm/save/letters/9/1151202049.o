__Letter "i just want you to know that my post was just my thoughts not anything thrown at you yes i do believe it is unfair but if that is the only way then it's the only way i'm sorry you feel you need to leave but everytime i need an admin or immortal i get no response like the other day i was showing a new person around in my guild and i got stuck down at the illum docks i thought daos was going to fix that but i guess he didn't everytime i ask for help i never get it i'm sure i'm not the only one.  and yes i have asked to become an immortal and i'm sure you would rather me stay as a player that i prolly couldn't hack it as an imm but i'm willing to try i just wish everything could go back to normal i wish you and nightshade weren't at each others throats. and yes i know stormy asked you to stay because we don't have an active team anymore because of some of the players on here. i also you like you to know this stormy ask carina an myself if we thought you and nesso could be good admins i told him the truth i told him i thought nesso could and that i didn't know you that well but Carina spoke nothing but good remarks about you. i know you an i both don't see eye to eye on things not many people do i just want a chance to help an if it doesn't work out i will go back as player i do like playing on the mud even though i haven't been very active just kinda hard with everything i'm going through. hey i'm not the most loved player on here just because i'm best friends with carina almost everytime i come on someone tries to start something with me here is one thing i would like to say to you fuck all the player they don't know shit and yeah alot of them are pains in the asses i'm sure i have been a pain but don't leave because because of them i haven't because i know they will feel they have won.be well DabFury"
