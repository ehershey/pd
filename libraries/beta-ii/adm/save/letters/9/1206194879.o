__Letter "Hey baby, lemme tell ya a lil story about my morning called...The Plot To Kill Me!I was on as Ki and Munky came on. Started talking on newbie and Ianswered. Then Munky wanted to xp and I thought sure, why not. Munky says s/he is too weak and switches to Markos, the necro.Markos is 26 so too high for me. Then Markos talks about dyingdown to my partyrange. I didnt want that so I switch to Amaki.Markos wants to party in the same area, inviting me to followhim. This sets off some small alarm bells. He keeps crying weak, saying he cant even hurt me. So, I decide to lead and go with him to sewers 2. I am sacrificing corpses and he asksif he can have the corpses for deathtouch. I say ok. But then,I think. I have experienced deathtouch before. It kicks majortail!!! With deathtouch, he could blast me into oblivionz!!!After we kill a monster or two, I pop a seal of tirun andhightail it outta there! I explain that I will not be dyingtoday but he keeps insisting he had no plans to kill me. I saythen 'I'd rather be alive and wrong than dead and right'. Hekeeps saying I have the wrong idea and he'll die down to mylvl 19's range. I say I need to go to bed, been working allnight and I escape the intricate trap!!!'You've gotta be smarter than the smarties and tougher thanthe toughies.' - Scrooge McDuckP,S, - I think Sunday might have to be our movie day, if thatsok with you.Love,JamesP.P.S. - Whatta fun morning. :) Take care, my love! I am goingto an arena football game tonight with my sister and some ofher friends! I will look for you when I get back...prolly about8 or 9pm your timeMore love,James"
