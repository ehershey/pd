__Letter "We all make mistakes, none of us is perfect. :) You have potential ina great many fields. You have very good intellect as well and a good sense of humor. Sure, you may fly off the handle here and therebut I think there's some lessons you could learn that could helpyou go very far. And maybe I might know a few things that couldhelp ya get there. And anyway, a friend doesn't give up on someone when they need a friend. Not my style at all. :)Oh, and btw, I really think you're Crystal, but if these chumpsat Darksoul are too foolish to even consider the possibility ofthat, they are ripe for whatever vengeance you can mete out.Anyhow, holler at me. :)Esco"
