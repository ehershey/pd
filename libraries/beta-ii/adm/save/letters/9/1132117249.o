__Letter "Hi there,It has recently come to my attention that you made a post on the Purgatory Square board (as well as the newbie line) regarding the scripts and macros that you used to gain EXP more easily.I'm sure you can understand why this topic generates considerable controversy among the other players.  What you did legally at one point is no longer legal, so I'm sure you can understand why this controvery occurs.  If you used those macros and triggers today to EXP for you, then you would be violating the rules.  You would be a cheater.  People don't get this difference.I guess the reason that I am sending you this message is because I would like for you to refrain from flaunting your accomplishments.  Many of our players spend long, hard hours of work.  I'm not saying you haven't, but people perceive you as being unfairly rewarded for your work, and leading the other players to believe that you pulled a fast one on Law is something that I'd like to avoid. I hope we have an understanding.  Have a good day.Levi"
