__Letter "I was just wondering if you have authorized Bellos to PK me.While he hasn't yet, he did say you gave him permission.The situation was that he had tried to pick my pockets and ended up failing miserably.A bit later I told him to come to the [], forgetting about the penalty f being arrested.Subsequently, he lost his inventory including a custom item and 4 black diamonds.He was able to buy back his normal stuff, and I gave him a black diamond of my own, but he said thay he wants me to replace them all.I don't this is necessary, because he got himself in trouble in the first place.So I am wanting you to remove your permission for my PK from bellos/any other guild members that know.Waiting for a response, Beleqwaya"
