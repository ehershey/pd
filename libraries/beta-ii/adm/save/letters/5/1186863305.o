__Letter "I suicided Kazuma due to a guild leader not leaving me alone about having too many alts. I always have regretted suiciding him, and I was wondering if I could possibly get him back. If you feel that it is unfair or unjust that I get him back that's fine, but I was just wondering. Thanks, please mail back."
