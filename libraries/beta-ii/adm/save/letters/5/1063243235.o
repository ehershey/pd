__Letter "Well, after looking at the boards, I saw a bunch of people say the following about reds: \"Red is strong all the way through..and tends to slow down cause they outgrow their scales\", \"reds are the \"fighter\" dragons i think its kinda crappy how with really high skills and stats, my exp capability is about 60-70% that of a normal fighter with my skills/stats.\"\"well drakule is like lvl 100 with maxed stuff..and hella stats..and his roar lasts only one round\"All of those posts are saying red dragons are weaker than they should be.  To tell me that your post was not directed towards me and towards them is insulting to my intelligence.  I will still balance dragons because I refuse to let one person ruin it for the rest, but I have a few other things I'm going to do before hand now."
