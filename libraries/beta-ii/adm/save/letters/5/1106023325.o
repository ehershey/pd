__Letter "Id like to know and see(if possible) your changes to backstab(in particular) and to the rogues in general.To my knoledge and experience from playing other classes, rogues were pretty balanced to begin with against fighters(charge, coupe, blah slash) and many other classes.I am a lvl 36 Assassin atm with 47 str, 43 dex and no stat over 50 atm. Im no longer instakilling lvl 24 or so mobs. I was also taking more damage(prolly cause i wasnt wearing my armour...) but it seemed to me that backstab and stab were reduced in strength by a considerable amount(around 200 damage).If you could send me the code you made for those abilities, I would like to look them over and compare them to the saved abilities i have stored from when they were balanced last.ThanksWraith"
