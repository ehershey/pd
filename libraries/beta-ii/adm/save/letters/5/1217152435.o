__Letter "Day 2. :) Myra and Russ left for their vacation today and Russbanished Misty to the basement for peeing in the house when weweren't there to walk her. I mean, what do you expect? She usually gets her 2nd walk of the day between 5:30pm-7:30pm. Wedidn't get home from the movies until nearly 11pm. Anyway, Idecided while I'm looking out for her, she won't make it downto the basement. :) I thought about you often today. :) Also, I xped several guys: Ki, Sabado and Uzamaki. Piehl was rathertalkative about Marine Life. All 3 partied with him today. Hewants to go back overseas and serve another tour. He sure hasdedication. :) Let's see...what did I do today aside from mudding?I watched a little baseball with Russ, hugged Myra and prayedfor safe journey for them on their trip as they were leavingand watched random tv including some Gaming Championship on G4.Yes, I watched other people play video games, heh. I meant tomake phone calls and get back in touch with some of my folks but that didn't happen. I did talk to Mike aka Noxus/Arma/Josh'sformer friend. He was feeling a bit sick but his relationshipis going well. His girlfriend got written up at work for beingon her cell phone or something like that. Her 3rd write-up. Kinda funny how I hear all about write-ups all the time. :)So she was kinda worried about her job, but I told him just be therefor her and help her feel comfortable.I guess I will wrap this one up for now. I hope you are somewhereright now (I am sure you are, hehe) having fun and sleeping comfyin style. :D I guess I am gonna get ready for early morning churchservice. Take care of yourself and Bonita and I will write youtomorrow. :) All my love,Your James"
