__Letter "Hey Frog, I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm just getting worried that you didn't see my email, so I though that this would be better.I just wanted to know if you can work for me this monday, 10/06 from 6 - 10:30 as an usher. I really need monday night offand I'll owe you if you do this for me, like maybe I can cover for you when you need off or something. I have thisexam coming up, and I only have one shot at it to pass and I need all the time I can get. Please write back to meor email or call or something. I need to let the managers know tomorrow night when I go in that I found someone to cover for me. PLEASE let me know soon, even on this game if you have to. I'll be on it later today or tonight.thank you\"send mail"
