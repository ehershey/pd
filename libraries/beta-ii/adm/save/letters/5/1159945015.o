__Letter "For Halloween, how about some candy ideas. You could have random candy that falls into the [], or is hidden around town, so people can have a candy hunt, maybe, or a small stall set up in the [] with a NPC that sells it to players. Maybe some of the candy can bite you when you go to eat it or something. Like those little candy vampire teeth you can get.I dunno... we need candy though ;)Ava/Riccard"
