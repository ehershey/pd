__Letter "Just a little bit more balance:Acidcone really is too strong. A lvl 30's acidcone is strong as my level 85 hellfire (my main spell. i use it instead of vortex). It needs to be cut about 50%Cut does too much damage and it always hits 4 times as a raknidTrip is too easy. should fail more.Boost should take 10 mp per boost. this would help balance paladin/antipaladin a little more if you dont want to remove boost (which i recommend)Centaur charge should take 2 roundscharging bonus to rush should be taken out or downgradedThats the main stuff i've seen lately"
