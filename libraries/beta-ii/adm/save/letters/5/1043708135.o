__Letter "Hey honey. :)  I finally got all my stats where i want them and my skills are maxed. It didn't take as long as i thought it would to max skills. :)  And now I'm level 22!!!!  *Savannah does the \"finally level 22\" dance*  WOOHOOOOOOO!!!! *Savannah howls at the moon*Oh, sorry, i'm getting a little too excited there. :) So now levelling should come along smoothly. Just up each stat once per level and max skills every time. I can get maybe a level a week. Or more even. I'm going to try to be online when you get back up, but no promises. If I'm not on when you wake up, I'll be on at my usual time at nights. 10pmish my time. Hopefully i can see you then. If not then I guess I'll see you when i see you. *Savannah grins broadly, a lot of her usual sparkle returning to her eyes, and gives you a quick, sweet kiss before winking and vanishing to the shadows.*"
