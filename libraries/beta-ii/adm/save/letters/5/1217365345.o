__Letter "Hey, long time no talk. Hope everything is well, heard you're in N.C. or somewhere around there? I tried moving to Charlotte, but ran out of money before it all worked out so I'm back in Indiana.I know you're too busy for PD, and I can understand that. But I was wondering if you remember saying you wanted to give all the dragons that actually played their characters a special ability that other dragons couldn't have? I wouldn't be suprised if there's a new dragon quest coming, so I was hoping you could tell the wizard making it about that idea because I'm sure Smite, Cortoth, Wisp, Orcha or myself wouldn't mind it. =PTake care!SMoKeY"
