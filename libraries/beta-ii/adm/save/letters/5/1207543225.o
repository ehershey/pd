__Letter "Hey love. :) Normally, if I sent you a mail with this subject, it'dbe about a ballerina wearing a short, frilly skirt. But as you know,I had the distinct honor of hearing Archbishop Desmond Tutu speak!After an ultra long introduction, Bishop Tutu got up to speak. Hehad a warm, conversational manner about him. He emphasized the powerof the human spirit and that we should all soar and aim towardscompassion and justice and freedom and junk. Well, maybe not junkbut junk was implied!I hope to see you on soon to tell ya more. :)And just to see you, you sweet lady. :)Love,Your James"
