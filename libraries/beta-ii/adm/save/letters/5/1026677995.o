__Letter "Hey. Umm... I just been thinking that wraith has gone a little nuts lately with his area and all. Its by far the hardest place in the game first of all and the mobs are almost entirely pointless except for challenge purposes. They are not useful in terms of exping because they give very low exp for their difficulty (10k for a townsman that takes me as long to kill as to 45k avatars). Also the eq on most mobs dests itself when i kill the monsters. The eq that doesnt auto dest often weights insane ammounts (198 weight on gloves, boots, cloak, and some other things). Also every time i've killed one of his monsters he goes back and makes them even stronger. 4 65k guards with special swords that slash and auto anyone with less that 50 charisma and swarm are now in many of the rooms. they do 3k damage per round to one of my chars who has taken a few deaths from them. They are 65k exp a piece which should be about the difficulty of a drow, but they are much much more difficult to kill.He upped his skeleton purgatory guards as well who are now roughly the equivalent of drow generals that swarm with up to 4 per room. Also he changed spider armour so that his dazzling armour would be the best in the game. Dazzling armour is hard to get but no where close to as hard as spider armour which is now less useful than scalemail from merk because it doesnt cover legs or head. There is already great armour for arms/torso alone with the forbidden armour and no need to downgrade spider armour to that level.He brags about his throne room and how it can kill anyone. You walk in and get insta-backstabbed for 1.6k damage (like the darksoul guards). This is enough to insta-kill almost anyone.Plus the room is full of all sorts of insane things that are immune to magic and have quad slashes and such (a lvl 100 with max md and 200 wis is parad for 2 rounds by me so i dont know how much md has on those mobs but it could easily be 1k). Basically he has it designed to kill peopleThe eq on the monsters are unwareable to make it worse. I have all the king's eq and none can be equiped and all it does is make a stupid message for people in the room to see about you trying to wear other people's clothes.Wraith made 1 mistake in his throne room. He made a lich (thinking i couldnt paralyze it and thus couldnt kill it). I took advantage of his mistake and turned it.So what does he do? He goes and recodes his monsters making them even stronger because one of them was killed.A lot of other people want to be able to try that area (cookie, loki, gab, halo all told me they are interested), but now its impossible for them to have a chance of getting the things in there because wraith is obssessed with his area being unkillable. Can you please do something about this so other people have a chance at the area and maybe make it so it would be useful for exp or at least the eq? Wraith seems to have gone a little overboard to me.Thanks for your time (i ramble waayyyy too much)-- AshPS please dont let him know i sent this mail to you. dont wanna piss him off or anything. thx again"
