__Letter "Ok, so i just had a conversation with Uzamaki about you killing Ghan because i'm in blacksails now (my brother is davyn). I wasnt aware that you killed him because he talked shit about your friend. I agreed firmly with Uzamaki that he owed her an apology and that he deserved to die. We then got into an argument because he believed than ghan owed the entire mud an apology but I strongly disagreed. I felt that if he apologized to her and she accepted it that all is fine. and that even if you kill him after the apology that you're still justified. But i felt like no one else but your friend had the right to be offended. Only reason that i disagreed is because A)i'm not easily offended B) who really cares what some loser on the internet says about you.. i mean you cant go anywhere on the internet without running into people like ghan C) Your friend was the only person insulted, for uzamaki or anyone else to make a big deal out of it is a little out of line.. sure it can be seen as standing up for someone else, or being righteous...but it's up to your friend to decide whether or not he is forgiven, it's selfish of anyone to try and take that away from her, if she says it's ok, it's ok.. if she doesnt think that a private apology is enough then it's not enough because SHE was insulted.. SO just incase uzamaki tries to say something to you that makes you think i have a problem with you please dont think that. if ghan ever says anything about you or a friend i'll kick him out of my guild and kill him myself....as long as it's ok with you :)"
