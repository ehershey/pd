__Letter "Make it so that anyone can get into any of your rooms? That's rather difficult with the current layout. Rooms at the moment are just private places to stop off. I can easily make it so that your three characters can get between each others rooms.There is not much reason to make the rooms open to everyone. I have found that when we had that, people just didn't go into the members rooms. There isn't really any reason to, except for when you are first exploring, and then after that they only ever go to places they *need* to go."
