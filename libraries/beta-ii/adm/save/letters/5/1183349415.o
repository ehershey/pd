__Letter "Samanthaalso known as: Amun, Carina and other players on Primal Darkness.Objective:		To obtain a position as the Event Immortal for Primal Darkness. What I can offer:	As a creative person, and as a builder, I can offer creative quests using old and new areas. I have seen quests before on Primal Darkness, so I have some sort of understanding how they can be done. 	I have been building for Primal Darkness for a couple years now and I have provided many ideas for spells and abilities, ideas for games and areas, and ideas for guilds.  I work well with others and I am not afraid to ask for help when needed, and I am not afraid to work under others and ask permission. 	I feel as thought I would be a great asset to the Primal Darkness Immortal Team.Experience:	Inferi Island (consisting of three areas: Marshes, Hamen's Tomb, and the Eye of Hell)	I not only built the area, but I also incoorperated a quest into it.  For the quest, you must be able to kill 2 mobs for items (amulet and harp), and use those items to save Inferi Island from the Dragon.  This area and quest are currently in the game.Vampire Quest	I am in the process of working the Vampire Quest race.  I helped come up with ideas, worked with the imms and admins on PD, as well as another player, in making sure the ideas are perfect.  "
