__Letter "This is where my area is. It isn't finished yet so :pThe village, which is pretty much where the coks would be located: \"/wizards/aziraphale/keep/rooms/zvillage/\"A hugh-jass path through the forest leading from the town, to the undead town/castle place: \"/wizards/aziraphale/keep/rooms/zforest/\"If you stray from the path you get lost. (I need to re-do this): \"/wizards/aziraphale/keep/rooms/zforest/lost\"The castle/city itself (This is *SO* not finished, can this be an addition after the forest and village are added?): \"/wizards/aziraphale/keep/rooms/\"If the areas have not got all bugs/typos/grammar errors, how long would it take to get in? I would really like it in soon, the place is designed as an excellent exp zone for high level players. Unlike bfields/purg/forbforest/drow and any other elite+ area. %^RESET%^CYAN%^*** %^BOLD%^WHITE%^Prator %^RESET%^CYAN%^***"
