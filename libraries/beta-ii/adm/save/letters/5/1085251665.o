__Letter "Standing in front of a magnificent cave that is encrusted with sapphire crystals around the mouth. Each blue stone shines brilliantly as it sparkles under the sun's warm rays. A large fountain can be seen of to one side of the entrance.cave - It seems to be the home of some large animal , but feels inviting nonetheless.sapphires - gigantic, brilliant blue stones and crystals outline the entrance to the cave. Their deep, shifting blues remind you of going to the water's edge on a warm sunny day.opening - It is very large, big enough for a large creature.stone - Brilliant blue sapphires cut into diamonds that reflect the sun's light.crystals - Brilliant blue sapphires cut into diamonds that reflect the sun's light.fountain - Water spews forth from the maw of a stone marble dragon, its gaze fixed on the heavens above. The water flows into a basin that is perched on four claw-like legs. Its entirety is comprised of white marble with gilded trimmings.^_^ how's that sound?"
