__Letter "I only wanted to know if you would be on at least kind of frequently. It's nothing against you, I'm just not trying to run an inactive guild. If the answer to the being online at least sometimes, then i'll gladly readd you... The cleanse was because of inactive players. Anyways, have a nice day.-Piehl"
