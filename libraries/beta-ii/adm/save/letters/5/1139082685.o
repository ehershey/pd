It is my goal to, in some way, force guilds to becomemore active, and maintain that activity. The cap on membership is just one example of this, but this is only the first step. Iwill be adding these changes slowly to help you all adapt as best you can though, so don't expect anything too massive for awhile. I have formulated a series of changes to guilds to make sure that not only members stay active, but that leadership/ownersstay active as well. I understand that a guild can become stagnant if the leaders disappear, so I've come up with a solution, andwill implement it when I think everyone has become comfortable with the current alterations.Let me stress again though, there will be no portals. Weapons/armour will NEVER have any specials. Prayer rooms will be allowedback after I've had a chance to alter them in a way to make them more pretty than anything.Now, after hearing many different suggestions, I've found most of them to be outside of what I envision for the future of guilds,but I want to encourage you all to keep creating ideas, and farm them from your members. I'm trying to think of new ones myself,but having not been a player for so long, it's been tough for me to think of anything that might be really cool for a player tohave.Anyway, enjoy!Daboura=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+="
