__Letter "Hi, StormbringerI just want to make a few points clear.I'm not complaining that Primal Darkness isn't like WoW, I was just pointingout that WoW got the right balance between grind and rewards.In Primal Darkness I often don't feel rewarded. When I train in a skill, Iget no feedback on how much better the skill got and if it was enough toraise a level. Ditto if a skill rises from using it. A bit more feedback would probably go a long way here.I've been mudding on and off since 1992 and when I first tried WoW I foundit stupid that WoW gives actual stats on items but it really feels like I've achieved something if I get just one more stat point extra plus I cancompare loot better and know what to keep. A compare like command, maybe evenskill-driven would be great since the description of an item offers nohint as to it's value. A small staff created by immortal A may be a lotbetter than the Heavy Staff of Sudden Death by immortal B.Asking on newbie is a way to sort this out but in-game, it's mostly guesswork.That was basically what I was trying to tell you. I know new spells arework as well as a balance problem, but a bit more feedback on success wouldfeel almost as good.There might also be some way to find out how much damage a player doeswith training dummies. They would have fixed HP and Defs and a playercould just try out how many rounds he needs to destroy one after a majorskillup or equipment change.If I learn a new spell from skillups, I'd also appreciate a message.Now it's train, check skills, check spells, repeat. How about the training NPCsaying: You have made progress in <skill> or I think you are now advanced enough for me to teach you <spell/ability>?I know that means lib changes but these changes are just in a few placesand would have a big effect on gameplay without being a balancing problem.On another note, I have coded LPC before and would like to do so again.If you feel I've been around here long enough and need a coder with asense of details to flesh out some existing areas, ask me.Personally, I'd like to do something for diversity, like proper attire formages, monk, etc. My imp wizard doesn't really feel at home with metal armourgotten from creatures much larger than he is. I shouldn't be able to wearthis stuff. Even if the lib doesn't support size based restrictions, at leastproper equipment should be available.Ok, that was that, a bit more ordered that I could have done it in chat.Just constructive criticism, no complaining.Aeldritch"
