__Letter "If ya don't mind keeping it up for a couple of days, my printer doesn't have black ink in it, I need it to refer back to it.  I'm going to use it in one of the mazes.  I decided, (since I'm the one coding the darn thing) that each maze will be a different sort of maze.   If you know of any other kinds of mazes, I'm all ears  :).  Thank you for taking the time out and drawing that :Pand my new phrase is gonna be BBA....bring back azire  :P"
