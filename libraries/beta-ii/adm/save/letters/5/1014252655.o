__Letter "I can do some play testing on balance for classes. Tell me if this idea would be alright with you. If you let me playtest level 25s and lvl 50s i can compare balance against each other and compare how well they work at exp/arena (i'll let caladan pound on em with ashram or dryfus in arena lol). I think i should be able to sort out which stuff needs balancing a little better like that and could tell which spells/abiltiies were overpowered/underpowered. If thats cool with you let me know and i'll test out the classes and see how well they compare :) SHouldnt take more than 30 mins per subclass to get a good idea of how well they compare (4 levels of killing. Lodos then Tenebrae then Temple then Drows). Kk i'm rambling lol :)-- Ashram"
