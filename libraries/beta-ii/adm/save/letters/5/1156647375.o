__Letter "Arcanis meets your gaze, her piercing blue eyes revealing nothing.  It is suddenly quite obvious that she is a fallen angels you hear about, though her aura is one of a good precense, you since a distortion, something twisted within her.  Though quite beautiful, you can tell she can hold her own, and would willingly fight for what she believes in. A small pentagram hangs around her neck, dangling just above her supple breasts, symbolizing her faith and her servitude to her Dark Lord, Asmodeus.  Her eyes suddenly blaze with anger as her great wings shudder, and you are forced to look away."
