__Letter "I'm sorry to hear that Helena has been being harassed. you can be sure that i will be paying attention to lines and see what i can see. However, i can't see tells or emotetos. If you both would be so kind as to copy/paste as much harassing text to me in a mudmail as possible, i'll see what i can do. As to what Nightshade said to Daos, we all get very frustrated from time to time, sifting through harassments and whatnot. Please dont take such a comment as inactivity on his part. We team up and try to eliminate as many problems as we can. It was hurtful to him that you said to get off his high horse - probably in the same way it was hurtful to helena to be harassed by galdur and seth. Instead of furthering the problem by playing round robin blame, it would probably be better to ignore as many comments as you can - copy and paste what you can to me - and take the more mature road out of it.As a female mudder, i can sympathise and understand the hurtful nature of harassment. I take an active stance in removing sexism and derrogatory comments as often as i can, so rest assured that this problem wont be glossed over. However, do realize that muds are not always safehavens and as frustrating as it is, we immortals and admins are not gods. ^_- Guild wars especially are NOT pretty. I'm sure we will be getting plenty of harassment logs and complaints as this conflict heats up. I'm at your service to the best of my abilities - Azire."
