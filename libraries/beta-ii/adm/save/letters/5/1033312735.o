__Letter "Not really, jus last night someone mailed faust a letter of a conversation I had with him (yakko did it, but I'm not sure if I had that conversation with him or not I don't really remember who it was I talked about with it) and faust got all ticked about it. But I was having a party so I just ignored everyone I could think of in Darksoul so I wouldn't have to listen to them if Faust was planning to kill me or something. But hey, I'm only 13, lol. I don't fight with anyone very literally, so I'm over it by now.Mocha."
