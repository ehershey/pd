__Letter "Dont remember if i sent this to you, but here is the help file for the \"Forsaken\" guildThe Forsaken Guild is a guild of the masters of battle and the arts of warfare. Skilled in both the physical and magical disciplines their name invokes fear into all who would oppose them. The Forsaken wander the lands in search of challenge and treasure, and a member is easily distinguished by the ring he bears and the coldness in his eyes and heart.-- Ashram the Black Knight"
