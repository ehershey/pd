__Letter "Hey, it's ok...  I'm just glad to hear from you.  It means you're doing at least a little better.  I was getting a little worried is all.  How'd your interview go?  I had one today, myself.  I think it went pretty good.  How bad was your allergic episode?  Did you have to go to the hospital?  How are you doing now?  Be sure to take care of yourself and rest...  I'll be here when you're feeling up to replying *hugs you tightly*                  -Paul"
