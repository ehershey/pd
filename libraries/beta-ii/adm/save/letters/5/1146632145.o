__Letter "Stormbringer -Hey, first off I wanted to apologize for all the mishaps that have occured lately on PD that drove you on here with an ironfist. These unfortunate events, however, are the reasons I am mud-mailing you. When Furiae and I spoke to you on the phone about the incident with Dubbya and Cenn, and then about your promotion of Daboura and Nesoo, I was content with being a player on this mud. I am still content with being a part of this mud, but since then, I have learned how to code guilds and areas, and learned the basis of some debugging certain things. I have been on PD for about 2 years now, and I have a good understanding of the mud and its players, not to mention i know the mud like the back of my hand. I would love to help and become an Immortal, specifically working with guilds and personal relations. If you ask anybody, I know the people on this mud very well and I know how to handle situations. I coded my own guild, The Last Saints, so I understand what is done to make a guild work. I feel that I would be a good asset to your team, I love to help and I love to code and learn new code. As much as I enjoy being a player, I enjoy helping and working on code just as much more. I am aware that when Whit asked people who they thought would be a good Immortal, quite a few people said that they would like me to become one. So I know that I have a lot of people that would not be disappointed should you choose to make me one (on an alt of mine of course).Please let me know what you think about this matter. Thank you,Samantha (aka Carina)"
