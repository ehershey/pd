__Letter "I just had a thought enter my head, and it might be cool, might not be but here it is. im not sure what you have in store for summons but it would be neat if like as you increas in level/skills you could get better summons, perhaps somethin higher than level 50. do you know how cool it would be to have to be lets say 65, for a strong summon that could aid you in hard places like drows/hell, and that could take a beating for ya too. well theres my thought :Ppeace"
