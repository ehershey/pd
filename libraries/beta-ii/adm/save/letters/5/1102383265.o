__Letter "ok..i would like this to remain strictly confidential for reputation purposes..but umm tauran and genocide have been exploiting a bug. he offered me some of this money but i turned it down. i did not want to get involved. i believe vian has accepted some of this money but i am not sure of that.he tried to get me to sac a corpse with lots of money on it (for the 2nd time) and i said no. i killed the monster but flew off without the money. i do not want to take ANY risks with this character as i have put a lot of work into it.anyway. the bug is.......some item in forsaken buys for a lesser amount then it sells for. i am not sure which item. but i do know its forsaken guild item. genocide and tauran are brothers IRL and i can guarantee multiplaying was involved in this also..not like it matters. exploiting should be bad enough to nail them to the wall.anyway stormy...when sh!t hits the fan it would be nice if you just claimed that \"i was checking through peoples money accounts and got suspicious\" or something like that..i don't want him knowing what i did because well as mucha s i think tauran is a complete FUGGIN MOOK i have maintained a \"neutral\" relationship with him.talk to you later.."
