__Letter "I am going through and re-working all the rooms for the illuminati. If I could get the current versions of all the rooms, as well as example armour/weapon/item shops, portal rooms and ridable monsters.With examples of these I should be able to code all the rooms without any extra help.Once I get *everything* done I will put it up for review, so I don't bother anyone too much.So when you get spare time, please. :)	- Aziraphale"
