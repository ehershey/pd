__Letter "I'd just use says or tells concerning this, but i seem to have issues catchin ye unidle most of the time...But I have a few questions, and curious if you can answer them...First, will the gauntlets be added to the Stuck Demon that you're aware of, or will we be required to pay for another shopkeep now.  Also, concerning the Scrying Pool and Lockers...I would like some more of your own input on how we should arrange them in the guild.  I figure putting them each in their own room would be suitable, however then we'd also have to get write-ups done for each room description...I can do this, just lemme know if ye want me to get it prepared.I should likely be asking an Imm concerning some of this, but im sure you know more on this than I do currently.And of course...Know that coding up those gauntlets for the guild is GREATLY appreciated by me by far.  I have had those ready to be done for a long time, and they've finally been hardcoded...Only need to be added now.Bellos d'Terrible - The Mad Mad Russian Demon"
