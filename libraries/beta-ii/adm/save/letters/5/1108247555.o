__Letter "I like some of those ideas.One thing that's important is that the gods tried to destroy Beheston's body too, and failed.  So they put him to sleep and built Tirun over him.  But the books could be possessed by certain families in Tirun, the books being like heavy magic wards over him.  Perhaps the books have to be destroyed in order for us to free Beheston.There's also Wildflower.  We need to bring her back.  Plus the sacrifice of Leviathas' soul (i.e. delete me) I only want to do if I get an imm position, in which case I can't play Leviathas anymore and it would be a really cool RP effect.I think Faust should take a really protective role of WF...  not only the demon princess, but his bride.WF and I discussed it so only she can command Beheston, since Asmodeus favored her before he dissapeared.I like the idea of books being involved like you said.I don't know how we'll revive Beheston though, since he's buried under Tirun, you'd think he'd like destroy the town when he rose...Levi"
