__Letter "Do you surrender your mind, body, soul, and entire existenceunto the One True God?  Will you in all your actions in life, and death, be doneto further the Dark Lord's ambitions and Nightmares?  All who would oppose Him,will oppose you.  All who would fight Him, will fight you.  All obstacles facedby Him, will be broken through by Us.  For We are His Mind and Body...HisSpirit, is Unholy.To become one with the Dark Lord Asmodeus, you must give yourself and everything you are into his watchful care.  And through your actions, bring his favour upon yourself and the guild.Heresy will not be tolerated.  To commit such an act of betrayal will end you up dead, dead, dead.  Unholy would seek you out, and have you slain until eternity does come again.  As payment for your sin against the Lord.All heretics outside our order, will be hunted and dealt with in time.  When the time is right, the chance is given.  And the blade will strike.If you still wish to be one of our Dark Regime still.  Then you must acknowledge that you know and accept what this entails.And you must repeat:I give myself unto the Dark Lord.  My mind, body, and existence are now his reign.  I will do nothing to be looked upon without His Favour, and i will further his ambitions even after death.  For We are His Mind and Body...His Spirit is Unholy!"
