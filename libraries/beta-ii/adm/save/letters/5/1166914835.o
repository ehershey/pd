__Letter "Bud i need you to set this for me.....There are some builders who have been inactive for AGES.Daos and I posted LONG ago that we would be culling the flock of thedeadwood. I need to be able to post on the tirun board to get theattention of builders whom have not been on the builders port forlong periods of time.Please let the staff know to leave my builder-posts alone on the board.It is important that I reach these people...... I'm not going to wipeoutsomeone who has a sizable directory unless I don't hear from them bud. How can i do the job that Stormbringer asked of me if i can't post here??Ironman"
