__Letter "Stormy, right now I can't actually do anything. I have no access to any files as well as any commands such as snoop.  In short, I can basically gag and sit here looking pretty.Is this intentional? If not, gimmie gimmie.If so, then perhaps it's time for me to transfer back to player.I dunno yo, whatever as your the boss."
