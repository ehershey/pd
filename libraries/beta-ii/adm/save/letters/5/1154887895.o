__Letter "i've asked whit (justin) about this a couple times, but he was at work and he never really had time to answer me. I was just wondering if there was anyway i could get plague restored? i know i shouldnt have suicided him, but i did it from stress and out of anger because i was havin some personal problems and what not and some other players were makin it worse for me. Thanks, Zubaida."
