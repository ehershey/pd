__Letter "Now I know you probably know this already but the Wanderer class is really weak. Our songs do just about no damage to players/ monsters and dances and so on don't really do anything as well. Liquid was talking to me and he says that most of his beneficial songs last about 3 rounds and he is level 29. All I ask is that our abilities do more damage and benificial songs and so on last longer. This would make the class more playerble. If you are already in the progress of doing this please ignore this letter 8)"
