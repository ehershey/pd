__Letter "Before I go on, a little history:Two days ago, I was sitting in a room with Azire..  we were just talking.  I was also talking to wraith with tells, when I noticed he was a shadow.  I checked the inventory of the room, and found he was sitting there as well.  I told him to leave, but it was naturally very upsetting.Since then, whenever I have been on and he has, I've been snooping him.  Today, he went invis, came to me, saw me with azire, then left and became vis again.  He then got azire's says and tells (because he cannot get mine).  I then proceeded with this conversation:You tell Wraith: was that neseccary?Wraith tells you:and i did NOT bring that up on purpose!You tell Wraith: do it again and you're goneWraith replies: do what?You tell Wraith: gettellYou tell Wraith: or getsayWraith replies: I can gettell on any player I need to, or feel a need to. I donot discuss anything in the gettells or getsays with anyone outside thatconversationWraith replies: you dest me for doing my job and I'll slap youYou reply to Wraith: it's obviously none of your business, she's with me, soit's not as if she's cheatingWraith replies: dude, you need to trust me, whatever I see I do not discusswith others unless its nessicaryYou reply to Wraith: I'm not worried about you discussing anything you see.  Ijust would like to have my privacy, and you're needlessly invading itWraith replies: you do have your privacy, I dont talk about what you do withanyone else, and I do gettells and getsays on just about every player every fewdaysYou tell Wraith: well, like I said, just dont do it againWraith replies: Sorry, I cant do that, but since I know she is with you, I wontdo it toniteAll I have to say is, you better make sure he doesnt do it again.  If he does, either I rid him and he deals with it or I leave.  I will NOT comprimise on this.  That is all.                     -Nightshade"
