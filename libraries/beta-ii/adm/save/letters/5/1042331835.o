__Letter "I was gonna tell you this, but you left before i could. When you said you'd be on 8 hours from now, that'll be 1am my time. I will definitely be on and I imagine my brother and his wife will most definitely be asleep. So unless you would have somehwere to go within a few hours after that, tonight would actually be better. It's up to you, though. Like you said, something always seem to happen to fuck things up. Hopefully, though, we can get it done tonight. And I'll discreetly try and find out if Prator is planning on being online at that time. I'll see ya when i see ya.I'll see ya when i see ya."
