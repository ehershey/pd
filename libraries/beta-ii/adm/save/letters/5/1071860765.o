__Letter "I just had an odd dream with you in it this morning....  I'll tell you about it ;)  I came up to visit you, and we were walking around outside.  We ended up walking by one of your friend's houses and your friend was outside riding a gocart lawnmower.  (I didnt recognize any of the friends)  She eventually stopped, and you both chatted for a while.  Then many more of your friends started to gather.  There were about 10 of them.  I got a little jealous of your attention, but then we all went to get on a raft.  It was wooden and square, and each \"team\" sat on a corner.  You and I were on a team in one corner.  We then would use our hands to paddle in a certain direction (each team tries to go in an opposite direction).  It seems like that would take forever considering we were in an ocean-like area, but soon we reached our island.  So we won.  And I got to kiss you *blush*  Then we had to decide where to go next, so we chose a small island off the north west coast of a country...  I think the country was iceland...  or finland.  somewhere in that area :P  so we started going there, and I woke up.  Kinda odd...  but fun cause I got to hang out with you ^_^  Anyway...  I know you like dreams, so I thought I'd share with you :)  I'll be leaving tonight to go to michigan, so I may be gone for a bit.  I'll drive carefully and will be thinking of you!  *smooch*                          -Paul"
