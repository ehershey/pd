__Letter "Tame is coming along really nicely.However, there is one problem that remains to be solvedI need a counter that stays on the playerWhenever he tames a monster the counter goes up by one, whenever the monster dies or he makes it go poof the counter decreases by oneAnd I need a way to reference this counterNow, firstly do you have any ideas about such a counter? Maybe an object on the player? Of course I need a way to make the object and increment or decrement a value in it as well as query itAlso, I need code that if the monster dies, the counter gets decremented.  Another problem is the limitations.I want to limit it so you can only tame a monster if the room is a forest, but I don't know the query for it."
