__Letter "on top of that nasty tidbit, Ven was attempting to push me into an argument with him over CRE and Newbieline last night - on Cre about his FATE death script, replying to my post - then prodding at me to explain myself thoroughly - insinuating again and again that my opinion didn't count , etc. On newbie - Daboura and I were discussing tornados with Endbringer/ a few aussies. Ven was cheering each time Dab or I said we were in the path of a tornado . -,-* both dab and I restrained ourselves from commenting. But boy am I pissed."
