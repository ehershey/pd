__Letter "Hi, glad you are having a nice trip.  I do miss chatting or just being on herewith you.  Xenia, Ohio - that's funny. :)Sure, if you want to tell me Josh-related news, that's fine with me.  I can guessthat it is probably that they are moving in together or getting married.  But,I'm okay with it.I will try to be on about 7pm my time tonight for awhile.I come on here to talk to you, but I know that I can't let J&K's presencebother me.  I'm on here to talk to you.Miss you a lothugsYour Raynaxoxo"
