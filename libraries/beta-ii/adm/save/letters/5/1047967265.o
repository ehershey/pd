__Letter "Well i don't know when i shall be able to spend time with you again on the mud, but hopefully soon. I had a wonderful time talking to you, though, and can't wait to do it again.*chuckle* One thing sticks out in my mind, though...My dear Jon, are you always so shy in relationships? I was geniunely surprised that all you did was sit beside me while we talked. I certainly was not offended andneither am i disappointed. But i should tell you now that you should never be afraid of doing or saying something in front of me. I you ever do anything I'm uncomfortable with, i wil tell you, though i doubt that situation will rise up. Until we see each other again, have a wonderful day(s), don't be late for work *wink*, andcontinue to talk through email. Til next time,Heather"
