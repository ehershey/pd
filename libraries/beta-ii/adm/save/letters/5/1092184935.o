__Letter "Problems with the Gypsy sub-class and suggestions on how to fix them:Please be aware that there are more issues than just these two, however I feel that you guys are probably stressing enough with the mud so for right now these are going to be the only complaints.Alignment.  \"The vagabonds of Primal Darkness, the gypsys striveto keep their herritage pure.  They make their way by tellingfortunes, singing, and a bit of thievery. Gypsys have noaliiances to any but their own. Gypsys are known for theircunning and mystical nature.\"What does this tell us?  We tell fortunes and steal, we don't care about others, and we never think twice about using a bit of trickery.  Gypsies are not good people.  Yes, there may be a few exceptions, however there are very few.  The skills and abilities you gave us lead us to be evil by their use alone.  I personally, flirt to keep things from attacking me, trip my opponent when he's not looking, and sing curses upon them to take away dexterity and hp.  It's come to my notice that I can no longer use my \"Dance of the blue oasis\" due to the fact that my alignment is set at \"demonic.\"  To my knowledge gypsies get about 7-8 dances two of which aren't even really useful.  We can't afford to lose one of the helpful dances to alignment.Duration of Dance and Song Effects:Because gypsies cannot perform more than one dance or song at a time (which is logical), I propose that you make the effects of the dances and songs last a while after the performance ends.  I say this because it is almost impossible to use them the way they are now coded.  The gypsy is forced to choose between dex or an attack, con or an attack, healing or stealth, etc.  Other classes have armour that lasts long after it has been cast, why can the gypsy not have the same benefit?  It would be nice to only have to use \"Dance of the wind\" once and then be able to use \"Fire Dance\" for a while before having to use \"Dance of the wind\" again.  Or, better yet, be able to use \"Dance in the shadows\" once and continue to pk or arena or just xp invisibly while using another dance.  Because there are no lasting effects on any of our songs or dances its practically illogical to rely on anything outside of \"Sinners Psalm,\" \"Dance of the Wind,\" and \"Cut\" when playing a gypsy.Thanks you guys for reading through those.  I'm sure there will be more but I know you are all stretched on time so these are the two more important things.Sugarcandy"
