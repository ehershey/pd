__Letter "I was wondering if you could put in a help file here on the mainport for Daos and myself. I want it to be called \"building\" andexplain where the contruction board is from tirun []. It would also explain to the to address their requests for a builder toan administrator, Daos or myself. I would perfer them to talk tome so i can regulate who i have on staff over there and whatprojects they are working on.The reviews of the projects will be done by you and Daos. My rolewill be to make sure their projects keep moving and their LPCquestions are delt with.The new system i built over there delt with 99% of the issues pastbuilders were having with builder (not being able to team up, builderscalling/snooping them, builders poking around their object's info, etc)I'm expecting that once a few builders start trying it over therewe will have several projects in the works. I just need to get theword out here on the main port.Again please set up the help file for me. We were talking abouthaving me immort over here. I would like to make a proposition there.I want to hold the post of \"Instructor for Builders\". Daos keeps thehead spot. My role is helping the builders master the LPC.If you want me to take on other items, i can. i leave that up to you.Ya seen what happened when ya left my hands free on builders *grin*(knocked outta few walls, installed a sun room, built a patio :P )Ironman"
