__Letter "That's fine, your opinion and you're welcome to it. But remember that every single thing I do has to have Admin aproval- everything. So what I do, the Admins agree with- there is LOADS of stuff I suggest which doesn't get through. To say that I am trying to take over the mud, or change the policies of the Admins, is not only wrong, it's insulting. For instance, before you go shooting your mouth of at me for guilds, the idea was DAOS', not mine, one of the 'original admins' as you say. I at least want to keep SOME things, like guild based oils, and the like. Daos want's NOTHING. He wants NO guild items apart from one, no portals, no healing rooms, no portals, nothing- that's the way he wants it. Nightshade wants to disband guilds entirely. Get rid of them ALL. So before you start accusing me of changing the way the game's running, against the Admin's wishes, you should get your facts straight. I do heaps for this place, I have since day one and I will continue to do so, but I find offense when people brush of all the stuff I've done and focus on one or two things they don't like because, quite frankly, they don't wanna get downgraded. The fact is- this decision comes from the Admins. It comes directly from them. To blame me is not only wrong, but self-dening. And, yes, as I said; Guilds are a SOCIAL thing, not a way for stupid hacks to get better swords. There used to be very, very tight checks on guilds and weapons were heavily scrutinized- but due to RL buisness of admins, some weapons and things were allowed in without being checked. Once players realised they could add whatever they wanted without checking, it went out of control. *EVERY MAJOR GUILD* had hacked weapons in their inventories- some were downright disgusting. The privilage players had to write their own weapons has been squandered. This is NOT any of our doing, but the doing of the small minority of players who cheat. I'm sorry everyone has to suffer because of them, but that's how it is. Many players benefitted from the hacked weapons, now they are being made to pay, too. And arn't they squealing."
