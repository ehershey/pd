__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Smokey to Spade Sun Aug 13 08:08:30 2006:-----i can bitch all day long i could probably even write a song about how terrible my old man is he's just a lazy old piece of shit i can call him lazy over and again but i don't consider he was up before 4 a.m. that doesn't matter one bit to me all i take into consideration is that he's lazy he hates his family and he especially hates me but i'm the one doing all the shit talking so maybe i have a problem just like him maybe it's that i'm being a bitch again i always say that i am done but in all honestity i find bitching fun so i'll just sit here and complain some more then i'll accuse him of screwing some stupid whores because i know he's cheating on me, i just can't prove it i get so mad at him i could just lose it oh wait, i already did and it felt great but now i just have to sit back and wait for him to do something just slightly wrong so i can bitch at him all night long "
