__Letter "Ok, i understand that selling the guild now...But still my \"personal\" beef with Chosen is rp based now.  Bellos is insulted with such open worship of a diety, but NOT also acknowledging Asmodeus as a greater god/the greastest.  That is a great insult to me, especially them attempting to recruit me!  I as a character found it insulting that they'd do such heresy against my lord.So my fight with Chosen is legit on the MUD. The contract was on the side.(money for furthering our own ends is convenience)So i hope you see that my fight on Chosen is based in rp.pls mail me back with a response to this, much appreciated."
