__Letter "also, just so you know...Stacey is not into Brent at all, it's not her fault that he can't let go.  For future referance, I just thought you would want to know that.  Stacey has told him to move on and they have no chance of gettin back together...it's HIM that is holding onto nothing.----------------- Original Message -----------------From: <a href='http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=103641940&MyToken=09f478df-3eeb-4f8b-8e3d-d9eb0a4f61a5'>Sherbundy</a>Date: Sep 5, 2006 4:56 PMMy name is Blanca.  I was one of Brents friend untill today. I wrote that letter to you because i want him.  He is so hung up on Stacey even when they are not together it  makes me mad.  All he talked about this weeked was Stacey. He loves her and Devin so much.  He told me that since you came to town thing have been different between them.   I wrote you because I thought it would get Stacey mad at him if she thought it was him who wrote you. Apparently it worked. We both got our wish from what he said but now he never wants to talk to me again. Sorry if i hurt your feelings. Stacey was lucky. I wish i had someone who loved me like that. Again I am sorry"
