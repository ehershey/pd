__Letter "Greetings fellow members of Primal Darkness. I am posting here today to present you with a golden oppurtunity that will not only benefit YOU, but it will benefit the entire MUD! I am issuing a challenge, more of a contest if you will.The prize? 5,000,000 GOLD COINS!!!!!Yes, You read that right, the prize for winning the constest is 5,000,000 gold coins! Now you may be thinking:\"okay, Endy is going to give us all this gold, now what do we have to do to earn it?\" Well my friend, the task is quite simple! All you have to do is produce a high quality, breathtaking area for the lands of Primal Darkness! \"But Endy, thats alot of effort and work!\" Now now, i know you all are highly creative and very imagnative, and think of the prize! you will be a multi millionare! \"Okay, so we make this area, then we get the gold?\" If the area fits into the criteria that i will state below, Then yes, all you do is produce something to be proud of, submit it to the higher powers, and if its put in first, then you win the gold!Now i don't want everyone to be doing this, and have just one person win then everyone else is discouraged and quits their area so this is how i will award gold amounts:1st place: 5,000,000 gold2nd place: 3,000,000 gold3rd place: 1,500,000 goldrunners up: 500,000 goldThe criteria for a good area is somewhat strict, but all you overachievers can easily produce something that well meets and goes beyond it.1. The area has to be a minimum of 500 rooms.2. The area can not be a copy of the same room 100's of times3. The area absoluetly must fit within the realms of primal darkness, no guns robots or any sort of things that would not normally be in the mud. I restate, the area must fit within the theme of the MUD.4. No overpowered items, the areas must be searched for bugs, and all sorts of cheating things will NOT be permitted into this project. This is a contest to help the mud, not hurt it.5. The descriptions of the rooms, monsters and items must have their own unique feel to them, try to stear away from normal bland things. We want this area to be breathtaking, not putting the players to sleep.FOR SERIOUS PLAYERS ONLY! I am completly serious about this contest, and i hope you will be too. Mudmail me with any questions or to inform me that you are competeing in this event.Thank you for your time,Endbringer."
