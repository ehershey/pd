__Letter "Generally, killing people isnt a problem, but you have to give them a bit of time to recover before you go and kill them again.  I've had a number of people say you've ignored that rule.  I just want to let you know that this is your warning.  Make sure you've given someone at LEAST a week before you go and try to kill them again."
