__Letter "There is steam pouring out of a hole up ahead.  Upon closer inspection, this hole looks like a mouth with big, red, ferocious teeth.Hole- It looks like a mouth with teeth, ready to gobble anyone who comes tooo close.Steam- hot water that is excaping out of the hole.Mouth- It is a hole with red ruby teeth.Teeth It is a ruby that is shaped in a tooth form.Set smell ??Set listen, A low pitch whistle can be heard"
