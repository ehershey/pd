__Letter "hey! ^_- well, i've been putting Nightshade through the ringer, drilling him on what i am and am not allowed to do. ^_^ I am able to remain a part of DW, nothing has changed in that respect, or in respects to my position therein, unless otherwise dictated by you, of course. And, aside from fixing typos and whatnot, i'm only going to be working on our little project, and anything else that you'd like to take on. ^_- so... just letting you know! "
