__Letter "Hey there, sweet lady. Take care of your peoples, very importantstuff there. I am on lunch at work and it's ending soon. :( I alsohave a couple gifts for Xenia for when she's big and strong. :DHere's a hint: It rhymes with wolf claws. >:)Duty is calling, so I'd better get back to being a good employeeand bring home the bacon. You're a vegetarian, so I guess that metaphor is lost in the mix. :)Please stay safe, have fun and all that good stuff.Love,James"
