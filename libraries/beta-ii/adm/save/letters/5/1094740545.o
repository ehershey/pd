__Letter "Ok we and Wisp were discussing the guild, which seems to have died. Now I can see why its crap, the building is crap and unimaginative loosewly based off the concept of 'evil' I was going to ask you if I could just redo the whole hall. but then I had an Idea running with the name. 'Army' of Darkness. Now thats cool but we dont seem much like an army at the moment. We meet at a freaking gambling hall@!!! Now to correct this I pose this idea. I want to build a Castle,  A large dark castle for the Army of Darkness. But this castle would actually be an xp area, with mobs to kill and stuff, the actual guild hall wo9uld be secretly located within the castle. for guild members to use. I kind have an idea of where it could go but i dont want to think too much until you tell me Yes or noGob"
