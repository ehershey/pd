__Letter "Just recently i have bought a guild called Acheron that Wraith had put in for us.  When the guild was implented there was just a few problems and i was wonder if you could fix this for us.Problems:1. We do not have a treasury, the room is there just not the vault to put money in, Wraith might of told you this already.2. Artanis (aka Wedge) request all the room descriptions to be dark blue not light blue.3. The guild sash was the wrong colours it's ment to look like this: %^ORANGE%^Sash of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Acheron%^RESET%^4. There was a mix up with our scrolls and orbs. The scrolls are ment to be our version or oils and the orbs where ment to be our version of stones. If these could be swtich that would be great. With the orbs when they're made to regen mp, where it has (Glowing) at the end to tell you how much life they have left could that please be the same as normal stones. One more thing with the scrolls, when they get changed to heal hp could these changes be made to the colours:<recite scroll>: %^ORANGE%^You unravell the %^RESET%^scroll%^ORANGE%^ and %^RED%^ch%^BOLD%^%^RED%^a%^BLACK%^n%^WHITE%^t%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ some arcane words.%^RESET%^healing part: %^ORANGE%^The %^BLUE%^energies%^ORANGE%^ from the %^RESET%^scroll%^ORANGE%^ %^BLUE%^mend%^ORANGE%^ your wounds.%^RESET%^*** people do not see any healing part like normal oilsAh and i forgot! to get the boost of mp with the orbs, like when you rub stone with normal stones could if please be changed to this:<clutch orb>: %^ORANGE%^You clutch the %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^orb%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ in the palm of your hand.%^RESET%^people see: $* %^ORANGE%^clucthes a %^BOLD%^YELLOW%^glowing orb%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ in their palm.%^RESET%^Well I believe that is all which needs fixing. Please mud mail me if there are any problems.hAh! one more thing if the colours of the glowing orb could be made to this: %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^Glowing%^BLACK%^ orb%^RESET%^thanks for your time."
