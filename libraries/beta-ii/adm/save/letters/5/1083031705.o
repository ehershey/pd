__Letter "thank you for understanding, that means a lot to me. I caught amanda cutting herself in the bathroom a few days ago, and i had to confront her about it. Since then its been a struggle to keep her afloat. We're going to have to try to get her committed. I'm so exhausted from coping that i have been falling asleep every 20 minutes or so. I'm so sorry paul - i miss you dearly."
