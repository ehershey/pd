__Letter "Well, all I can really say is I'm sorry I haven't kept my promise.  You're still my friend and I'll talk with you if you'll let me.  I've gotten out of playing on muds for the most part, and partying in general has lost it's appeal.  I still enjoy chatting with you, but it may be rare.  It's not because I dont care, either I'm afk, or just dont really know what to talk about.  Anyway, I'm sorry.                             -Paul"
