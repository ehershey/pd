__Letter "Here is my proposal for the vampire character.  Let me know if you have any questions or want me to clear anything up, or have suggestions/alterations...  whatever you want to mention.Also, if you want, share this with the person that you're going to talk to about it.  Your call.This is my proposal for the creation of a sovereign vampire character that I wish to play for several purposes.  I think that the current quest races have been ‘broken', a term I throw around on the mud a lot to describe the rewards from quests that have been leaked or were inherently just too easy.  A signature sign that a quest race has been broken is that the population is excessively large compared to the player base for every mortal, for example, there are ten Demons and Archangels and Dragons, which were intended to be rare and prestigious races if I am correct. I'd just like to take an opportunity to first describe the current quest races and my opinion of their unfortunate situations.I played the original Primal Darkness and had the luxury of being the first demon character, and was privy to a lot of Asmodeus' plans.  Demons were powerful back then.  I'm not exactly sure how they are arranged at the moment, but Asmodeus justified their power because he believed that their population would be low and that he could police their behaviour.  Having gifted them with such power, he would expect a certain type of behaviour in return: evil.  Therein was an intended balancing factor for demons.  They were supposed to be Primal Darkness' elite evil and under the control of a master.  I don't really know anything about Archangels, except they were also intended as the antithesis of the demon in a war.  I'm assuming that their power will suffer degrades as well for the sake of balance.Today Wisp and I were discussion Dragons, and she remarked that they were much less powerful than they should have been.  I explained to her that it is not justifiable, from the perspective of one who is trying to balance the system, to provide advantages to a race that is common.  Quest races with few members will always be the target for advantages, and they will be special if they have advantages.  Demons, Archangels and Dragons, for all the effort that was put into them, are far less special or prestigious than they aught to be.How does allowing me to play the first vampire help at all?  The idea would be that as sovereign to the vampires, I would act as a system of control on the flow of new members to the race.  This restriction would really be arbitrated by the administration.  If they wanted to put any sort of cap on the number of new vampires, they would need only inform me and I would refuse to induct new members.  To avoid complaints from the players, the end of the actual quest could notify me that a player had completed it without actually telling them.  The next stage would be me approaching them and asking them if they wanted to become a vampire (obviously in a more eloquent way), but a very nice finish.  I could also refuse to induct new members if, for example, 20 people did the quest in one night, which would clearly indicate foul play.Other than being a system of control for the growth of the population (but ONLY if commanded to do so by the administration), I feel that this character would hugely enrich the culture of Primal Darkness through role-playing and involving all of the other players in an unfolding story.Ok, so you may be convinced that there should be an original vampire in place that helps to ensure that the system works properly.  But why me?  Well, I invented the vampire project on PD-1 with a now extinct admin named Inferno.  He contributed the idea that they don't actually experience a physical death, but since then I had provided detailed designs for the race.  For example, the huge vital advantages (~50 hp per con/level), their regenerative prowess (and the overall concept of them being based on HP, the cockroaches of Primal Darkness, notoriously difficult to kill) I also wrote a long paper on blooddrink and how it could work and a long list of potential abilities for the race to have.I feel that I have a clear view of what the vampires should be like, and I could role-play one excellently.  I had an interesting history worked out and am dying to gradually let interested players in on the adventure if you will let me.  Also, I am totally willing to follow specific guidelines and sign a contract.  If I am not playing this character, the first vampire will end up being a hardcore player that uses the character for PK-domination, not really having earned it any more than I, except in the experience leading up to the completion of the quest.  If this process is an issue, I am fully willing to sacrifice all of the experience that my current character has in a trade for what would equal the effort to build up and quest for vampire. As a final bargaining chip, I offer to sacrifice my ownership of Unholy in exchange for this ‘management' position that I look for in vampires.  I love my guild and do not offer it lightly, only suggesting this to somehow make up for the value of what I ask for and to illustrate my commitment to this project.ContractHere is a contract which I am willing to print, sign and mail to you.  It outlines restrictions on my use of this character.  If at any time I violate the limitations implied by this contract, I willingly hand over my right to the character.1.) This character is subject to all of the commands of the upper-level administration without hesitation. 2.) This character must role-play at all times, except with communication to the administration.3.) This character must block all lines and tells, having no form of ‘instant' communication other than the mud-mail system (which is essential), to ensure a realistic, ‘in character' playing.4.) This character is extremely restricted in his ability to PK, being allowed to do so no more than once a mud-year unless attacked, or after a formal mud-mail request to the administration with a satisfactory explanation included.  5.) This character may only refuse to induct new members to the vampire race, after they have completed the quest, with explicit permission from the administration, or in the event that a ridiculous number join in one short span of time (an indication of leaking or foul play).6.) This character also functions as a play tester, helping the administration with issues of balancing the vampire race.  (I think this is another really valuable reason)7.) This player must willingly relinquish ownership of this character if ordered to do so by the administration as the result of unsatisfactory performance.Please add any other rules to the contract that you have.  If there are other issues that concern you, please let me know, so we can discuss it together.  I love this game, I know vampires, and I promise I wont let you down.Sincerely,LeviA.K.A. Aiden Beattie"
