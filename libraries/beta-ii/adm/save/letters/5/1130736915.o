__Letter "I made a Criminal Activities board a while ago.  I never linked it to the Wizlounge though.  The room is in /wizards/levi/crimroom.c and I've done a new Wizlounge in /wizards/levi/testo.c which has the exit leading west into the new room.Basically, the Criminal Activities board gives us a big record of which players are doing what.  With the recent Kumi incident, I'm sure you can see how this would be helpful.  Especially so if the administration were to change in the future, as we could leave behind valuable information.Your call.  I did the code, so if you want it in just go for it.  If you do want it, I think we should brainstorm a template for reports.  Like decide exactly what kind of information should be recorded each time.  Maybe IPs, LAN information, whether or not a punishment is dished out, etc."
