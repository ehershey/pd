__Letter "Ok, seeing as this Sasayaki thing is carrying on, we should stop it now. Im not the one to say who you should belive or not, so believe whom ever..Anway, 2 things to ask:1. Eta till we can really try and pk him? lying and getting us in trouble for nothing kinda annoys us, so an eta would be nice before we actually can try and get him.and 2. The rules on PK, as in; holywar, guild and just normal pk. Im not sure if the help file is upto date or not, i just doubt it somehow ;)Sorry to bother and all that, just would like some clear guidelines.Thanks :)"
