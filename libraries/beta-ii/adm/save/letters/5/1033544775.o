__Letter "I'd like to start by saying I never came to you before with something like this, pk is pk and I never complained about it, for me or anyone else.  This however is pushing it.  Faust killed seth.   Eios just killed faust.  Seth = Eios.  Now I read your posts, and I'd like to see something done about this.  Rules are rules right, I'm tired of seeing these aussies get away with murder, he needs to be punished like the rules say.  Just because pk is being banned doesn't mean he can pull this last min shit and get away with it.  I'm only telling you this because faust doesn't want too, he doesn't want to come across as one of them, complaining to the imms when shit happens.  So I'm doing it, because Eios went too far.  Scarface"
