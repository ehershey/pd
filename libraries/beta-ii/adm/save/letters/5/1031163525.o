__Letter "Sorry about the earlier mail. I just lost it after my... 5th time being instant killed by backstab.I simply *can't* play PD any more. People don't like me for when I was Aziraphale. They kill me because of that, but come up with some other excuse so they don't get called for multiplaying.I would really like to play, the mud itself is good. But I have lost more than any player other than Ashram. He, however, has the backing of faust and yakko et.c I have nothing.Perhaps if you look at it like this: I have lost a lvl30 paladin, I have lost a lvl50 paladin, I have lost a lvl50 Archangel paladin, I have lost a lvl50 cleric, I have lost immortal status. I simply cannot take working as hard as I can just for people like yakko to destroy it on a whim.cure meBefore I could handle playing here because I was a cleric. I had bonuses because of my class. Now I have nothing.If I had *something* I could play. But any ideas I come up with won't be placed into the game. Not because you don't care, just because you won't like them in some way.I'd really like to talk to you, though I suppose you don't want to talk to me. That's fine.Prator is to be removed from gameplay, I'd like to keep a backup somewhere so I don't lose my character permenantly. After Aziraphale I couldn't take losing another charcter like this.Like Cenn, I just *CAN'T* play here. Aziraphale, Prator, Whatever."
