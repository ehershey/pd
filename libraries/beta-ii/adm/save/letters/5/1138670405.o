__Letter "Dear josh,I came on at 7 ur time but u weren’t there. i was hoping to talk to you, but im packed with a shit load of homework. Anyways, I hope you had a good day. My bro is going to be on, so you can give him a hard time ;)If u want that is, but either way, I won’t mind. LolI finally learned how to salsa. Its pretty easy, and my teacher “liked the way I shaked my hips” lol. But my friends were saying that I should teach you. Lol, I was laughing. But that would be fun. Sorry, but I havta go now. I will try to talk to you again, babe, but no guarantees.Anyways, I miss you*hugs and kisses*simran"
