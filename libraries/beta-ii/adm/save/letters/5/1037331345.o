__Letter "If you want to see him not quit. I suggest you do your fucking best to avoid him for a long long long time.I don't want to hear any shit from you, frankly I don't care.  To me you are nothing but a virus and from now on I'm treating you as such.But if you care about Soulfly, then you will not bother him until he has had a chance to calm down."
