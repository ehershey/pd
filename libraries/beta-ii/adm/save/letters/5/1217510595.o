__Letter "Hey love. :) The wonderful folks at work decided not to pay methis week. Apparently, there was a clerical oversight. Instead ofgetting paid at midnight last night, I have to come back in topick up my check this afternoon. I guess it's way too much workan hour or something. Anyway, more updates soon! Sleep is callin'something fierce. All my love,Your James"
