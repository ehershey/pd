__Letter "... I spent so many months(1yr.) devoted to him only for it to end miserably when we met face to face. What makes this any different? I felt like I'd never fully love someone again. I have to be strong. I can't be vunerable. I can't let someone into my heart like that again. What if I hurt you like I hurt him? What if you really hurt me?Side 2: You're so different from what I'm used to. I can't control you. I've got no power over you. You don't \"worship\" me like everyone has recently (past relationships). It's so weird. You're just.. apathetic to me. You like me, maybe even love me (thinking about that right now just sent a warm wave through my heart) and I know that. I have tendencies; bad ones. I'm fickle, unloyal(at times), I lie, I'm a bitchy person, I'm uncompassionate and manipulative. You like(d) me, I like you, I'm used to those that like me becoming obsessed. It used to bother the hell out of me, but now I've become numbed to it; used to being put on a pedestal. I could do no wrong in their eyes. I could cheat on and abuse them and they would take me back and love me still. It was so unhealthy. I provided for them what they wanted, self confidence, caring, and an ear to cry on and in return they gave me a sense of self worth, they made me happy because they needed me. I longed to be needed.Then, I met you. You didn't care about me, you didn't want anything to happen. It amazed me. You didn't need me. It was.. a new experience. When you told me you didn't want a girlfriend, I was reassured. I mean, it's easier not to fall for someone when you know they have absolutely -no- interest in you. You intrigued me, but I was able to forget you because you had no intention of talking to me much. Then you let me call you back.. damn you, and I really got to talk to you. I became enraptured with you. You were so different. I knew this, but I didn't think that that would be a reason to change how I treated the guys in my life. I didn't think that I would have to act differently to you. I assumed my previously bitchy behaivor would be ignored and forgiven. But, you didn't. You got mad. I tried to talk but was conflicted. You had no problem with me leaving and not talking to you. You didn't care if I left hurt or upset. It both appalls(sp?) and amazes(d) me. You're drastically different from what I know. How was I supposed to react? I wanted you.. but didn't know how to treat you. Inevitably I think thats what caused many of our problems.Continued in next email.Heather"
