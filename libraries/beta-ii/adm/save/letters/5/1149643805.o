__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Figjam to Spade Tue Jun  6 13:41:22 2006:-----Heya Spade. Out of no where I got pked by Revel and he took the diamond. But then right when I got back to the monument he got arrested so I don't know if he still has it or not. I'm sorry that I got pk'ed but there's not much I could've done, he insta'ed me. You told me to let you know if Arma killed me but Revel is in DS too, so I figured you might be able to do something about it. Sorry againFigjam"
