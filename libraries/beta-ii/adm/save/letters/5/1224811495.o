__Letter "You say: questThe elder caretaker says: Long ago, Death plagued this land like a pestilence.It moved like lightning and struck like a falling rock on all those who opposedit. It killed the whole royal family, and with its thirst for pain andsuffering  finally sated, it slinked away near here..You say: deathThe elder caretaker says: Death came to this place a long long time ago, when Iwas only a boy. It has terrorized this town and all who live in it since itarrived. It is rumored that he has holed up in the old building just east ofhere.You say: buildingThe elder caretaker exclaims: Many people have gone after Death, only to diewhile trying to relieve us poor folk of his influence. If you wish to faceDeath, you must go quickly!That's what I'm referring to, if you're in Purg [] go all north, gates, east until you see the Elder Caretaker, that's the mob, then all east of there is said building.If there is no existance of the building, I'd like to whip one up real quick. Actually gonna hop on builders real quick and work on that til the wifey gets home and starts in on her bitching.=D"
