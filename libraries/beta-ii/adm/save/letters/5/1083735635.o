__Letter "Im working on an area called Tombar.  It is possible that I can add a new dragon quest to it if you would like.  Newbs wouldnt be able to make em because Tombar is on an island and is all non-gate.  You can scroll and stuff, just not mage gate.  /d/tombar/rooms/island/1 is the entrance.  Whit"
