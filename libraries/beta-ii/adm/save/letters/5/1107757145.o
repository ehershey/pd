__Letter "I love it!  But I think the gem or tiara on the floor should be more obviously bad to pick up.  Because the first instinct is to grab it.I think Wildflower should have a lot of power within Unholy.  Not a leadership position, but like we worship her.  I give her permission to boss members around...  so like it's not like an immortal messing around with us, because Leviathas gives her permission to be respected and feared.Our help file says discipline in Unholy is strict.  I'd love to have Wildflower to help me.  Sometimes Bellos and Set would go over my head because they're just tougher than I am.  With the Demon Princess herself, they'd be more in line.I think having a scary powerful Wildflower in the guild will be good.  It will force members to worship Asmodeus and RP.  It's all in the help file...  so I say it's ok for us to enforce it.Levi"
