__Letter "Hey man, I'm getting really burned out here. It seems like I spend all my time researching rule violations or helping the builders. I just dumped the builders. Dumping rule violations won't be quite as \"easy\" (it's not easy to tell people \"Fuck off, I'm not help you any more\").Anyway, we either need to get an Imm to fill Levi's shoes and do the police duties for us, or someone else (you, Azire, Hepualahoale, Dab) is going to have to do it, or I'm honestly just going to stop logging on. The crappy part is, I can't think of any of the active players that I personally would trust in such a role. If people think I'm anal about names, Carina would drive them all away with being a line nazi (you should see how many complaints I get from her!). I'd suggest Endbringer, but he's rarely on. I don't know any of the other people well enough to comment on them one way or another, other than there's a lot I wouldn't recommend just from their childish behavoir on the lines.Right now my plan is to work on songs some time this week, hopefully get them done, then take a break for a while, pop on to read boards and ignore any complaints I get about players. I know it's selfish, but, hey, I am exhausted today, and work hasn't been that bad, so I'm guessing it's just the stress of dealing with this shit all the time.Anyway, sorry to vent in your direction :)"
