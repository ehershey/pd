__Letter "You don't need to worry about multiplay / connection issues, the system will logeverything and won't even allow multiple players on at once unless they'reon a registered lan (or one is linkdead, but that is displayed/logged).If there are any law-type issues with that just pass them on to me.Don't assume players are trying to do something bad, especially with connections;connection issues happen to everyone."
