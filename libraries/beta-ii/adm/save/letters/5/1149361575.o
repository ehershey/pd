__Letter "hey this mudmail is about the law in PD... Frankly to be blunt, there is none... if you check the harass logs of the like the last week...Smokey, Nulvect, Arma, Spade (and his alt aloysius) and your son, Tal...have been not only harassing me but furiae...we try to stick up for ourselves as there are no admins/imms on at all... It's beginning to become rediculas how much the players are cussin on newbie line abusing the filters harassing other players...and even slandering them when they are not even here....Again I ask, to be apart of the Immortal stature... Not only can I code (areas, have yet to learn how to code full on spells etc etc), but I know the mud really well... I think that the fact that I have just stood up for myself, in a non slandering way shows how mature I can be about situations, as opposed to how i used to be a year ago. I know the mud like the back of my hand, and I know the rules and have never cheated on the game. I love this game very much, and it saddens me how much some players take advantage of situations or the admins/imms.  I would love to help and become an Immortal over Law and guilds...if you dont want me to be alone on these tasks, that's fine with me.  I just really feel like I could be really useful and helpful, and a darn good Immortal.thank you.Carina"
