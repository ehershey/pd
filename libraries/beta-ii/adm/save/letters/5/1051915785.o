__Letter "I can't get to email right now so i had to send you mudmail. I should still be one when you get up, but if i'm not, it's because of storms. The most of it has passed, but there's still some thunder and lightening hanging around that might kick me off. If i am not on, i will be online as soon as i am able.I love you,Heather"
