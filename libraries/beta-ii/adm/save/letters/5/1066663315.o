__Letter "Hey, you might get an invoice in your P.O. Box from Tundra. She just told me today she sent it off last week. She also said that they dont take cash! lolHow do you want to do this? You can mail me a cashiers check or something and I will mail you back the 60 bucks or I can put it in my paypal account to be used on the purchases for the lab computers. I'll ask her if she will take a credit card or something like that. she said the reason she dosent take cash is os she can have a trail to follow."
