__Letter "For fun, I decided to hit up another site to see what it had to say (intelligencetest.com).Well, here's what it said... and keep in mind, this was after a long 10 hour work day wiht only a 1/2 hour lunch and a quick 10 minute break, so I was very tired at the time :PFull analytical report for QPlease bookmark this page, it will be available online for two weeks. You may also print a copy of each section for your records.General statisticsTotal number of questions: 30Questions answered: 30Questions not answered: 0Questions answered correctly: 27Questions answered incorrectly: 3Percentage correct answers: 90 %Your age adjusted IQ score is 132 and the average score for all test takers is 100. You scored higher than 99 % of all the people that took this test.Your Grade ** Gifted **Anyone with a general IQ this high is considered to be gifted. You have the ability to think critically, conceptualize ideas and form your own conclusions. Your ability to think in patterns and to produce order out of chaos enables you to see logic in everything and handle most of lifes complexities. Needless to say you are self-aware of your abilities and have the brains for all known occupations. If you think of intelligence as the ability to adapt easily to new situations then you are at the top of the charts. The funny part is that I picked \"I don't know\" for two of the questions, so I really only missed one that I tried to solve. The two I picked \"I don't know\" on were too difficult to do without some major rthought, and I was feeling too rushed to do them (15 minute time limit). I'm going to go back and look at them now, or they'll annoy me forever :P"
