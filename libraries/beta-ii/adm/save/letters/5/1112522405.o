__Letter ")There is a boy who was seen trying to pickpocket a forsaken member inTenebrae. Find this \"innocent\" child and show him what happens to thieves. Cutoff his thumb and prove your dedication.2)The lords of Tirun have been taxing us to no end. Hit those fat-cats where ithurts, thier bank accounts. You must find a way into the vault of the tirunbank and get back that which was taken from us.3)There is a disgusting man who takes refuge in the forests north of Tirun. Hehas managed to evade us so far, your job is to find him and bring us his head.4)Our rivals, the DarkSouls have staged a hidden encampment in Helgrath andhave a vicious raknid beast guarding it. Find this beast and prove your loyaltyto the Forsaken and your contempt for all others by removing his head.Also, there are two fiends that have been causing us trouble and must be dealtwith.For our younger recruits, we ask that you search the forests of distopia andtrack down the demon hunter Ilythid, bring her wings back to us as a trophy andproof of her demise.For our older, more experienced recruits, your task is to head to the town ofRoston. Sneak your way into the drow encampment and snatch the head of thiergeneral."
