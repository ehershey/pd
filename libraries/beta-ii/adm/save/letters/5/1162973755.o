__Letter "The server suffered some type of internal failure on Sunday.  Michael sentthis email out to all account administrators:kay, I got the server back up and running… Primary Site: www.murpe.comOperating System: SuSe Server, Version 10.1Kernel Build/Type: 2.6.16.21-0.25-smp -- x86, 64-Bit Kernel (Dual-Core Ready) The server is no longer running under VMware, thus everything is running in real-time! I have already created everyone's account back to the way it was - i.e. your_sub_domain.murpe.com should work.The kernel has been upgraded from 32-bit to the new 64-bit layout. You will need to recompile your game to get it working on this new operating environment. Known Issues:- Internal domain 'murpe.com' e-mail does not work yet (i.e. support@murpe.com = bad). Have to reconfigure it a bit.            - Old account passwords have been voided out. I will send out a new one shortly once I am ready."
