__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Escobar to Escobar Thu Oct 26 08:07:24 2006:-----1. The potential recruit should be informed that they need to mudmail eitherRohl, Smokey or Escobar. The mail should contain some information like level,mudding background, special skills and why they wish to join Darksoul. From that point, whichever of the three is mudmailed can forward the applicationto the other two.2. Each of the three should speak with the potential recruit at some lengthto get a decent impression of the candidate's strengths and weaknesses andeven personality quirks. After one of the three interviews the potentialrecruit, we will mail feedback to the other two and propose a test of sortsfor the recruit based on the information obtained. This test might consistof but is not limited to: obtaining certain items, a set amount of xping,public declarations or other random tasks.3. Once the potential recruit has been interviewed by the three, we may thendiscuss the task ahead of them should they be deemed worthy. These discussionsmay take place via mudmail or in person until we come to an agreement. Afterwe pose the task to them, one of the three should be around to observe itscompletion. Should the task be completed, as approved by the three, thatperson is immediately eligible to join Darksoul.4. Should one of the three be absent from the process for a week, theremaining two will come to a decision. The absent party will be keptinformed of every stage of the process and may provide their input untilthe termination of the approval process.Thank you,Escobar"
