__Letter "Awesome.  I appreciate the support hopefully I'll have something to present before the weekend is up.  I have one more inquiry though.  Could I create a quest race.  I do not wish to create something outstandingly powerful such as what already exists but merely something new.  I would like to encourage some roleplaying and if players were able to be a member of race with a detailed background in one of my areas perhaps we would see more of it.I dont intend to do this immediately.  Id rather produce an area and show you what I am capable of.  So your decision may wait until I have a race in mind.Your trully,Zoi --,'(@"
