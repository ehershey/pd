__Letter "could someone fix our guild entrance, asap.  I've been informed that it does not validate the players guild before letting them enter.  I reported this to Venenum about a week ago, and he promised to fix it.  Perhaps i should have coded the entrance for him.  Anyways, anyone who is able to get this done please do so, as it is fairly urgent.-Evolution"
