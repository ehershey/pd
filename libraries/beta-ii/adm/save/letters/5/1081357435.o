__Letter "I think that Agent is becoming a real problem. He isn't leaving players alone and is attacking law zones. I was attacked by him from the shadows just a few minutes ago. This is the second time I've been attacked by Agent and I know of other players who have been both attacked by him and PKed by him. Half the time they were in Lodos or Tenebrae."
