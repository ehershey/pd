A floating sensation floods yoursenses. You can feel that you no longer have a physical body, be that for thebetter or worse. Your ghost sores high above your dead body. You feel yourselffalling...Dark energies emerge from the monkey's paw and heal your wounds.The hazy mist fades away from you, leaving you in a strange place.You look around, and find yourself in an endless black void. Spirits fly pastyou in greenish streaks across the black sky.As you try to leave, you notice a huge, dark figure hovering before you. Thefigure seems to be an old and powerful spirit. The spirit has two firey pinpoints for eyes, but is otherwise undiscernable besides a long shadowy robe.The Spirit says: Wraith.. Ghast has struck you down?The Spirit shakes his head.The Spirit says: You know who I am, right? Of course you do. Wraith, I've beenkeeping track of your deaths...The Spirit says: You have died a total of 13 times.. That's a lot more thanmost of these ghosts around here.Autosaving.The Spirit says: Okay, listen. I know how you feel and I'm the type of guy whounderstands that sort of thing, and I'm sorry for you, but there's not much Ican do.The Spirit says: You really should be more careful before charging into battle,but hey, we all make mistakes, right?The Spirit says: You've died quite a bit for your age.. Why I'm twenty millionyears old and I've only died about seven times.The Reaper grins proudly.The Reaper looks up at you and says: I know you want to get back to the mortalworld to get revenge..The Spirit says: But knowing you, I don't think it'll be that long before I seeyou back here again.You frown disapprovingly.The Spirit says: I know, it must be depressing.The Spirit says: Just to make you feel a little better, I'm going to tell youthe secret of life..The Reaper clears his throat and opens his mouth to talk.A voice in your head says: Primal Darkness-II calls for you..The Spirit says: Oh! Too bad.. Your time here has run out.. Time for you to goback.The Grim Reaper's Spirit waves to you.You feel yourself falling, then suddenly you find yourself in a familiar place.Leviathas tells you: =|prayYou return from the dead!hp: 10|sp: 81|mp: 0 >  newbie oh hell no, I wasnt even near 0Wraith <newbie> oh hell no, I wasnt even near 0hp: 11|sp: 85|mp: 1 >  Leviathas <newbie> They know what you've come for.newbie no, seriously, I wasnt near 0 when I diedWraith <newbie> no, seriously, I wasnt near 0 when I diedhp: 14|sp: 97|mp: 6 >  Smite <newbie> ~*~ torso or head? ~*~Smite <newbie> ~*~ body damage can be lethal if ur not paying attn to it ~*~Smite <newbie> ~*~ simpsons back on. woot ~*~body=+=+=( Body )=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+Left rear leg is damaged:      0 %       Fourth arm is damaged:         0 % Left foreleg is damaged:       0 %       First hand is damaged:         0 % Third arm is damaged:          0 %       Torso is damaged:              0 % First arm is damaged:          0 %       Right foreleg is damaged:      0 % Abdomen is damaged:            0 %       Second arm is damaged:         0 % Fourth hand is damaged:        0 %       Third hand is damaged:         0 % Second hand is damaged:        0 %       Head is damaged:               0 % Right rear leg is damaged:     0 % =+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+="
