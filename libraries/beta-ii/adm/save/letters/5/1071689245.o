__Letter "Careful now...  9-8 is pretty rough hours.  Just so long as you're enjoying yourself ^_^  been busy here too...  we've usually got about 6-7 people in our apt at any given time all studying for tests.  Things are looking up for my classes, which is good.  Dont go and overwork yourself now *waggles a finger at you scoldingly*  if you overwork yourself I cant come visit you sometime ;)  Take care.           -Paul"
