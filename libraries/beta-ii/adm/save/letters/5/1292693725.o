__Letter "Id like to formally hand over Forsaken to either Kilir or Piehl. They have much better judgment then Yang ever had. I never really wanted to be the leader of any guild, DS and Forsaken. I got both of them by default. Noxus ciding and Faust just being inactive. Id rather be a player and not put up with other peoples BS. Kilir would be a great leader and he always been there for the members and for me, Piehl can keep everyone in line, wether they like it or not. Im asking this as a favor, I dont really ask for much, but this is one thing that i think i need to do. Couldnt mail you from Yang because I just couldnt deal with it. I dont blame Abraxas for leaving, i thought i was doing the right thing by trying to fix what i did wrong, but i should have thought of my current members first. Kilir wouldnt have acted as hastily as I did and in turn this problem would have never occurred. Thats why for the members and for Forsaken I once again formally resign.~Yang Stormy"
