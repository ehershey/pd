__Letter "I guess he has already mailed you. Anyway, just wanted to say why I decided to do it, and why I thought it was ok.1) First pk was purely to get a kill on him for Angel vs. Demon.2) He had killed a guild member a few minutes earlier, which I thought would void his protection from us.3) He was out of a safe zone and it was pretty much gogogogogogogogo no time to argue! So, yeah.He had a pretty good lip on him at the time too. I guess he was talking so much trash because he knew he was under protection from all of Illum. Personally, I don't like htis for hte same reason that newbie thieves shouldn't be able to steal. People should have to deal with the consequences of pk acts, regardless of when they last died.Ok, tis all."
