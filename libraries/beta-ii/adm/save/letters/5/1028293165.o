__Letter "OK, i really think gore needs to be upgraded a bit, because i get 6 melee a level, only 5 blade, yet slash still does more, and with max melee and pretty good stats for my level i only do 200 damage with it, when others can easily do more, with like 12 less strength then me... And then there is the problem with gore not been in my rage, basiclly without gore and massacre in rage i'll be a lame version of a fighter. Please i really need these modifications to make my character.ThanksAldur"
