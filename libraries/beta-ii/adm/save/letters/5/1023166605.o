__Letter "Wedge admitted to me that he used Artanis to move funds over to Wedge to buyhis Guild. he also told me that was the only reason he did it since he isntgoing to use artanis that much anyways, and wanted Wedge to lead Acheron. ThisI can accept, and here is a copy of the last part of our conversation:You reply to Wedge: yhea, but 2 characters are committing the crimeWedge replies: Not really.You reply to Wedge: yes reallyWedge replies: Both character is a bit harshWedge replies: Isn't losing the main character enough of a punishment?You reply to Wedge: in a robbery, if you have a driver and a robber, the driveris an accomplice, and charged with that the crime of assisting even though hedid not stick up anyoneWedge replies: Can i like redeem myself. i don't lose both?You reply to Wedge:  its not that hard to regain characters on this mudYou reply to Wedge: Id say noYou reply to Wedge: its not real hard to work characters up thoughWedge replies: is for meYou reply to Wedge: you are already a lvl 20You reply to Wedge: type ageYou reply to Wedge: and you did that in 34 hoursWedge replies: 1 and half days of solid xping.You reply to Wedge: yupWedge replies: that took me a week RL timeYou reply to Wedge: that was about where I was in that ageWedge replies: Man this blows.You reply to Wedge: I know, but its the flip of the coin manWedge replies: It leaves me with no reason to play on this mud. If i havenothing.You reply to Wedge: whys that?You reply to Wedge: you could start a swashbuckler, or try a new classWedge replies: Well i spent 7 months getting artanis the way he is. And if loseit all then i really don't care anymore.You reply to Wedge: hrmmmmWedge replies: I can deal with lose one character, but both...Wedge replies: Like if you kill artanis (which was my main character. 7 monthsworth of main character) then i can deal with it. but if i lose my guild andthis thief. then what have i got? nothing. and all the soulflys and ashramswill get so high i will never be able to defend myself.You reply to Wedge: and how many people know you are wedge?Wedge replies: who i wish to knowWedge replies: admins and a few friends.You reply to Wedge: Im going to have a conference with storm tommorrow anyways,we'll talk about itWedge replies: So i should bother xping. becuase i am just gonna lose thenright?You reply to Wedge: I dont know right nowWedge replies: If you can. just let one character live. thats all i askYou reply to Wedge: possible punishments are: loss ov one or both characters,money loss, stat loss, skill loss, lvl loss, deaths(not dests) and a wholebunch more thingsWedge replies: okeyI lost the first half, forgot to put it on notepad, but you can probably find it somewhere.  this part of it says that he will not have a reason for playin this mud if we get rid of both characters. What I propose is desting Artanis(a given) and dropping wedge to a lvl 5 or around there from his present lvl 20, by using either call player;set_level or call player;dieremoval of all funds as well, which is logged in the money loglet me know what you think or talk with me tommorrow, id like to keep him as a player here."
