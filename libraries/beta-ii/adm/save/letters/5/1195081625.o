__Letter "Hello sweetie, I miss you too.  You need sleep, that is most important,I will always be here, even if it is in your thoughts.  Do not worry aboutit.  I am quite positive that Saturday evening (since you are off), I willbe home alone, so I could chat with you.I will also be able to talk tomorrow morning if you want to.I miss you like Snuffy misses his Bird (well, not Boco - although I thinkScilla would like him).Talk to you soon, miss you to verrrrry much.Love,X"
