__Letter "Guys. I would like you to consider coding in an exemption string* tothe mail limiting system. I would suggest exempting the staff from it.You KNOW the staff is not going to do a mail-bomb. There's no pointin gimping the staff as well as the general population.I normally send multiple mails like i did to you whit. This wayyou can screen out what topics are important to keep and what isdeletable. I normally do 4 or 5 mails all at once when i sit andupdate people about what im doing. Especially when it is messingwith the access codes on builders.Ironman"
