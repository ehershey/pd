__Letter "Unholy has been offered...a rather interesting offer...I have made no promises that we'll accept this contract, but i think it'd be beneficial that we do.Orcha has offered us money for every dead member in Chosen by Unholy's hands.This is in response to Vian and others stealing the guild away, and restructuring it to their own ends, from the true owner.  Vlad.  he lost all his ownership, and Orcha wants vengeance on behalf of his comrade's loss.The deal for this would be as gollows...-10K gold for every Chosen Head-NO KILLING Vlad, or of course our spy in Chosen(Tchon)-No hostilities towards Forsaken, otherwise the contract will be breached.  Forsaken will also abide by this term.Now...I know out right war with another guild so soon, may not seem advantageous...However...look at the grander scheme...1)We'll have Orcha as an ally essentially, for aiding him2)Vlad, and \"his\" Chosen guild will be technical allies of ours, for we re-procured their rightful places of leadership.3)Forsaken would be off our cases almost indefinately...until we're ready to stand firm against them.4)A small amount of money towards the guild.---I made sure to mail this, so that i was 100% sure you would get wind of this...This could be the spark to set us off.Plus...gives us another excuse to beat that whelp Vian around some more, for the provoking of us he did in the recent past.%^GREEN%^~*~%^BOLD%^BLACK%^Bellos d'Terrible - General in the Dark Regime%^RESET%^GREEN%^~*~"
