__Letter "I got cut off earlier so i dont know if the mail got to ya.What i'm talking about for a link to builders is the following;   1) It would only be usable by a staff member. Only the      archwizards and adminstrators would be allowed.   2) Access to the java link would only be shown once the      person logged into the site. It would be invisable to      the non-staff. We already have the login screen on the      webpage so it shouldnt be hard to put it into that menu.   3) We could alter the login.c on builders to test for      adminp() if the link is coming from the site's isp.================================================================The only reason im asking for this is so that i can keep tabson the newbie builders requests for help thru the week. I'mon all day Sunday but i dont wanna make them wait that long.It's ok if you say no. I'll come up with another way to keeptabs on things when im in and out of my office.================================================================Ironman"
