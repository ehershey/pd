__Letter "I was wondering when your going to do the FTP for the mudlib.I would like to get started on adapting it to the builders port for you.Do you want to wait until after Nulvect installs the sensory system??This way the mudlib would be fairly identical to whats on the mail port.Main thing is that the help files for the lfuns will beI start writting them for that port. I cant start the lfun help files untilI have the current mudlib to work from. THat way there will be less things that  you have to worry about adapting later to make the areas work here on the main port.Just mail me bavck with your plans on this so i can plan what im going to be doing.On a side note, I'll be rewiring the TIrun Reef area using my sensory system.Please let me know what changes if any Nulvect has to do to adapt it to the current mudlib.Ironman"
