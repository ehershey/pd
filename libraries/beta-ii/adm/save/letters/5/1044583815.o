__Letter "What a mess! This room looks like a tornado hit it! As you look around the room, you cant imagine a messier place on the planet! You notice a very large bookshelf with tons of magic and spell books. You look over one of them and you notice it say's, \"How to turn intruders into dust.\" There is only one spot in the room that isn't messy, there is a bed against the far wall with pictures of Mathiu's family.You look over to your left and hear a growl, you decide to get closer to see what it is, when your 5 feet away, a 3-headed dog jumps out at you, attempting to bite of your head! You Then hear a booming voice in your head saying, \"Who Dare Disturb The Room of Mathiu!\" You decide to leave the room at once.As you stepped into Dragoth's room, you feel a slight cold chill crawling downyour spine. It's strange that a bedroom has no bed.  The room is dark andgloomy. To your left you see racks filled with the deadliest weapons from allover the land. To your right is a giant book case filled with ancient magicalbooks and scrolls of deadly magic. The power that radiate off of it is toostrong that you had to take a step back. Right in front of you is a portrait ofa beautiful young girl. At the bottom corner reads \"Love forever RMH.\"  You tryto get closer for a better look, but a cold voice suddenly screams \"GET OUT!!!\""
