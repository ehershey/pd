It is a place ofpeace and rest dedicated to the Gods of the realm.  The bustling activity ofthe town does not encroach upon this place.  Not even time invades thissanctuary of the Gods.  A magnificent fountain of a dragon dominates the centerof the park.Akarine the sorcerorA town guarda fountainan old tattered boarda pit"
