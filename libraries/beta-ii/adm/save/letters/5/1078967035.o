__Letter "Actually I got my title from a cool doormat on thinkgeek, I just didn't bother changing it on account of a post. Besides, it's only obvious for people who are extremely computer inclined. I've had a few people ask me just 'what the hell does 127.0.0.1 mean'.On the other hand, you didn't have to go and give everyone the exact IP. Like it matters anyway if you play from a different computer.Scourge was exaggerating the whole plotting thing, she was just having fun thinking of it that way. It wasn't some huge conspiracy, we just thought it was funny.In regards to giving out info, you don't have to go tell every player on the mud about something, and then get it wrong. What is up with everyone thinking I was making this big cheating spree? Where did you hear your information from? The only people that know the whole truth are me and Nightshade, and possibly Wiz and others depending on who NS told.So, how exactly is it that you feel that you can point fingers at all these people giving out info, and then go ahead and just spout stuff off yourself?"
