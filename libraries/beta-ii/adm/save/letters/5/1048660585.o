__Letter "Each day could you remind to never answer the phone once it gets to 10:30pm your time.Dra rang and I couldn't get him to finish so by the time I actually got into the shower I had to get out already. And this is on a day where I *have* to be in on time or the manager gets pissed.So just each day, remind me that I promise myself to only let you distract me.Sorry for the abrupt ending but I did not get the time to think that I wanted even thugh I said goodbye to you earlier. So now I am just irritated beyond belief.See you in the morning."
