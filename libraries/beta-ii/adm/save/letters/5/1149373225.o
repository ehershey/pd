__Letter "I don't know wtf the deal was earlier. It's more like you expected me to be a dick to you. I didn't kiss your ass, but I didn't give you a reason to assume any hostility.If you seriously considered the conversation earlier \"harassment\", you haven't been mudding long enough. I was tired of you trying to call Arma out on newbie line, calling him stupid, and trying to tell him how resurrect works. You can't march around thinking you're tough shit, because you're not. I'm not either. There's only 1 person who should do that here, and that's Cortoth. Bad mood in real life or not, don't come here and take it out on people. And if you do, expect the bullshit right back at you.And I remember a night last week where Carina was on the phone with you at the moment and she asked 4 or 5 times to call me. I don't want to meet you guys. I never did. Like I said earlier, I know where you work and if I wanted to see you, I would. But I have absolutely no interest in it. I'm going to be perfectly honest with you, and take it as you will. I'm pissed of at Carina. Since I'm pissed at Carina and that stupid guild she leads, anyone on it is on my shit list. You're her best friend, so that alone makes you lower on my list. You never did anything to piss me off until you started calling Arma out this afternoon. And if you notice, he's in my guild and I'll defend my members as best as I possibly can.Smokey"
