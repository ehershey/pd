__Letter "Had a thought... dunno but this might help you guys with pk if it works...try out using royal pikes... they will special and disapear on the first hit, but its a BIG special... could do a lot considering your guys size. 1 hit weapons like that would be good if you were pking. Not sure if it works but worth a try.-- Ashram"
