__Letter "The way it was before, if you got your stealth high enough, even with stealth off, people couldn't see you come in and out of the room. But now that they fixed it, you have to actually turn stealth on for that to happen. There is no natural stealth anymore. So before stealth was good for rangers, not anymore though."
