__Letter "I love both of them, great abilities! However, my only concern is that i got them around the same time, perhaps they should be spread out level wise and one made slightly stronger/weaker than the other so they arent such similar abilities. Anyways, i love the descriptions, and i can finally stop using retarded daggers. I was also thinking perhaps you could remove all knife abilities and replace them with some lower level melee abilities, i apologize if any of this sounds demanding, but of course these are just suggestions and you may use them as you will. But i have to say i am so impressed with the two abilities, they're so much fun to use, i love making mobs cough up blood with clobber, and just imagining my character using smash is just fun! Anyways, its 6:03 am an i just stayed up an hour extra to play with these abilites, they rock!"
