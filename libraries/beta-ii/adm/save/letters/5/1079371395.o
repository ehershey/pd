__Letter "the only thing that i have talked to dimi about is to shut him up about the holy swords. all ive said to him is that yes they are a guild item and that it has been approved by all the admins (whether or not this is true is another matter).But the good thing is, is that he has talked to me about the forsaken items and i almost had a chance to read the forsaken board a while ago. If anything, i am almost a spy for illum in forsaken using means IRL to get info and shit.Crem"
