__Letter "I am coming to the end of my busy season soon.The shelter i work with has 250 beds. We had 403 people......Took us awhile to get us under 250 again. Trying to get us under 150and i'll be back coding. Should take about 2 more weeks.Then im into my summer slow cycle and will be around alot like i useto be."
