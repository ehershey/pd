__Letter "Hey, um...don't know exactly how to explain this, but when i arena'd a fighter yesterday when i won, for some reason i got the fighter con bonus on my hp, it stayed like that for a little, wasn't sure how to make it go away, but its something that I thought was fixed, you may want to take a look at it, just a thought."
