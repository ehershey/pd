__Letter "Leviathas: VAMPIRE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES  ----------------------------------  I hope that these strengths and  weaknesses can strike a fair  balance in the race.    Let me note, also, that vampires  can recieve extra damage by  spells v.s undead, but are not  weak against holy attacks.  They  are not set evil, just undead.    STRENGTHS  ----------------------------------  - +50 hp per level/constitution    - 20% of vitals healed per round  naturally.    - gets same penalty for losing  a battle, but never 'dies', as  death spares their body and   takes them back to his palace.    - great night vision.    - immune to poisons/diseases or  any form of bodily decay.      WEAKNESSES  ---------------------------------  - regenerative abilities are  useless during the day, unless  indoors.    - all outdoors during the day  is too bright to see in.    - almost all abilities are   useless/ineffective in daylight    - vampires gain counts for  killing, but anyone can kill  them without punishment   (not only are they monsters,  but never actually \"die\".)    - upon first coming into  contact with sun (i.e, dawn,  or stepping outside) they  suffer 50% damage.    - particularly weak against  turn, but not ridiculously so.    - no easy heavy damage attacks,  they have to pump massive   amounts of effort to achieve  this.    - everyone gets blood points,  which don't normally drain.  A vampire must drink someone  else's blood to replenish  theirs, which drains at 2 BP  per minute when they're moving  fast, and 5 bp/minute when  they are battling.  It would  not drain when they were  standing still.    BP would = constitution.    A vampire's natural healing  freezes when they hit 0 BP,  their stats are all temporarily  halved.This is the stuff Levi sent me on vamps. Just so you have a list and can be thinking of how to do some of this junk as well as if it might need more balance.Stormy"
