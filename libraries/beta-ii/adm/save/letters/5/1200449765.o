__Letter "Well, my rage from that tedious and enjoyable battle has settled down.I felt the blade in my hand and immediately became consumed withthe need to take the lives of those monsters.  It must be in my bloodor maybe my commitment to the antipaladins.  Fighters have long beenin my family, but no-one has ever commanded the desire to becomeantipaladins.  I will be the first in my family.  I hope that pleases you, for I am first and foremost, your wife, friend,confidant and lover.  But, I also have the desire in me to become a goodwarrior, by your side, of course.I will strive to make you proud of me.  First of all, I am a woman, with all the same desires and passions.  Secondly, I am a fighter antipaladin.  When a weapon is in my hands,I become a fighter.Thirdly, but most importantly, I am your soulmate, destined to be withyou from the day I laid eyes on you.  I knew I loved you then and willalways.  As always and ever more, yours in life, love and battle,Noelxoxo"
