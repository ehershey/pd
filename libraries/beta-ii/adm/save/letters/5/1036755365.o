Here is my first article, which you may use as a refernce to my talent of opinion writing.                       My two cents-                      Player killing.                     	Player killing is an all around popular thing here in Primal Darkness. My opinion, what's the point? If you kill someoneit's not as if they are dead and can not come back. They will come back, and when this happens what do you gain from it? Sure you showedthem that you could do it. Isn't that what the arena is for? The fewtimes you may actually succeed in killing someone you usually do not get anything. On the rare occassion that they leave a corpse with something on it, it doesn't matter. They can always get whatever theylost back. What do you gain from this? The satisfaction in knowing that you killed someone. Again, isn't that what the arena is for? Even if you do get there stuff, big deal. Unless you are killing someone who carries one hundred thousand gold on them you didn't accomplish much. So I ask you, what is the point of player killing?                                                          By: Vampira. Vampira."
