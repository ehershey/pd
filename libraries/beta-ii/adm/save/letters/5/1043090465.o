__Letter "Ok, I re-made the path in my map editor, and now I've got all the 'lost' stuffplanned out. Rooms don't loop at all so you can get back on the path easy, as long as you know where you are.Two Questions though.1) Is there a limit to the number of rooms I can be using here?2) There are a LOT of rooms. Wtf, that wasn't a  question... anyway, there's like 500+ rooms, and they don't all connect to each other. If you go off the path you can only get back on to it where you left. So it would be possible to do this in parts (bringing it to game port I mean), it'd take me about 3 hours for each 'section' since I have to use a grid to name the rooms, and checking it takes time.Last note, I'm not bringing it on to builders yet. I am saving each room as a text file that begins with \"ed room.c\" \"i\" and then ends with \".\" \"x\" - So You can just copy paste the files into your command line and it will make the room. That way it doesn't need to be copied with ftp.C'ya.- Prator."
