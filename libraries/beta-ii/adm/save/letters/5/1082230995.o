__Letter "Hey NS-First off, what I say here, if it stresses you out even slightly, don't even bother acknowledging this mudmail. I can take it to another admin just as easy as I can take it to you.Before I get to the point of the mail, I'm going to let you know why it is that I go to you before everyone else. There's actually a lot of reasons, but I'll try to just list a couple things so this mail isn't too overwhelming.%^CYAN%^Firstly%^RESET%^, and most importantly, I don't have much of a personal relationship with you. I don't even address you as %^BOLD%^Paul%^RESET%^, I always refer to you, even when someone discusses you with me, as NS or Nightshade. The reason this keeps me coming to you is, the other imms/admins that I have personal relationships with, come to me for help all the time, mostly with personal problems. Once the relationship came to that point where I was being their ear, I no longer felt comfortable ging to them with problems on the mud. I guess it's because I knew that they were going through a lot in real life, and I actually knew what those things were. With you, I can only %^BOLD%^assume%^RESET%^ that you're going through a lot. I don't actually know if you really are, or what it is if there is anything. Also, I'm always careful about where I tell you anything, I %^BOLD%^try%^RESET%^ to make sure that you're around on the mud when I ask you anything about it, that way you don't have to interrupt yur real life for mud issues. %^BOLD%^I am not kissing ass, so don't get a swelled head.%^RESET%^ %^CYAN%^Secondly%^RESET%^, you and Whit are the only people that I think are truly competant enough to fully grasp a deeper understanding of whatever the problem that I have may be. The other admins, are never around, so there's not too much of a point for me to go to them, and...you know how I feel about the current Immortal situation, so I won't go there. However, Whit has a really rough time dealing with his real life, I think he's jus at a rocky point in life and isn't really very stable at times. I don't know how volatile he could be, so I'd rather just not say anything to him, unless he seems to be in a good mood. As for you, from what I've ever seen, you are very level-headed. That's basically it, in a nutshell. I don't want you to think that I am purposely going out of my way to completely ruin your mud-experience. I've never (believe it or not) tried to piss you off. I rarely argue with people. If I actually do argue, there are two reasons I do this. Either I'm so completely bored that I actually think arguing with someone, even if I don't really disagree with them, will be fun, %^BOLD%^or%^RESET%^, I actually think if I engage in an argument with that someone, it'll somehow hange things. Either I'll learn something, or they will, or we both will. Otherwise, I pretty much just avoid conflict like that. When I argue with you, it's not to make you mad, or to make you feel like I think I'm the almighty mighty word in everything, and you don't know shit, it's because either I want to understand your reasoning, or I want you to understand mine. It's important to me that miscommunication doesn't occur. But, it always does with you and I. Most of the time, after a small argument withyou, I usually come to a better understanding of whatever it was we argued over, and I thank you, apologize, and walk away.Alright, and now, the real point of this mail. :) Sorry for going on that tangent beforehand. Well, a player on pd, Agent (Mazrim), used to be in Ethereal. He left Ethereal to join Forsaken so he could team with them in killing Illuminati members. However, after he left, he also started attacking Ethereal members. I thought nothing of it. He ended up killing probably over 6 of them. One night he and Seth teamed up and followed the smaller members of Ethereal around the realm, and they slaughtered them all It didn't hit me at the time, but what Agent has been doing (he still does it 'til this day, yesterday he PK'd Posenda for being a newbie & and an Ethereal member) is going on a PK spree for about a few weeks now. He's died quite a bit due to this, either he'll attack the wrong member, or he gets sentenced to death. I didn't know that was against the rules, but this morning I did <help pk>, because I was trying to find out about the murdering offences...and I read that players will be dested if they go onthis \"spree\". I've asked my members to post on the Ethereal board if they've been PK'd by Agent, to try to include a date/time, and the number of times they've died to him, as well as if they know anyone else who has been PK'd by him. I'm doing this because I think it will make it easier on you to make a decision.As I said in the beginning of this mail, if you feel stressed/aggrivated in any way over this, please don't even bother thinking about it. I won't bother you again on this subject. If you decide Agent doesn't deserve to be dested because of this, I won't argue you on it, you have my %^BOLD%^written%^RESET%^ word on that. If I do not hear back from you at all on this matter in three days, I will take the matter to another admin, so you don't have to deal with it.Thank you,Kumi"
