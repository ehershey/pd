__Letter "The following is a list of guild changes that ARE allowed:A1- 1 guild hall of any size and description, as long as it fits withinthe theme of the MUD. No airconditioners, faxes, phasers- even in privaterooms.A2 - Healing items equal to in every way (including cost and availability butexcluding description and effect messages) Oils and Stones from Tirun andArlon. Better healing items, even for greater cost, are not being considered.The reason for this is because, even though there are better healing items outthere then the ones in Tirun/Arlon, they are not sitting there for level 1's tobuy. The problem is access, not cost.A3 - 1 guild line.A4 - 1 identifying item, WC (if applicable) and AC 0, no specialfunctions, autoloading only for members of that guild irrespective of level.A5 - Guild Lockers. If your guild has guild lockers, 1 will be allowed.If your guild does not, they will be allowed to expand to have them.A6 - 3 or less Guild Subhalls of any size and description, as long asthey comply with the description rules outlined in A1 and the teleport rule ofD1 (that is to say, they cannot in any way be accessed from Tirun or any otherplace, nor can they be used as a method of returning to said places). A Guildis limited to one outpost per town or city. Guild subhall entrances may behidden, although the method of accessing them should be reasonably obvious forthe average player doing a determined search. That does not grant access to thehall, but allows the entrance to come into full view.A7 - 1 Guild treasury.A8 - Healing rooms. Healing rooms are clones of the fountain in Tirun in everyway, shape and form, excluding descriptions and actions taken to activate it.Current healing rooms will be converted to this system. Those without a currentaction (automatic healing) will be prompted for one.A9- Boards of any description, size and frequency as long as they comply withthe descriptions outlined in A1.The following is a list of guild changes that will NOT be allowed:D1- Portals to anywhere not inside Tirun City. This includes linking tosubhalls, or any other way that allows free transportation between places.D2 - Guild teleportation items. This is because, although they could be set tofunction exactly as the items from Tirun, their presence would increase theiravailability.D3 - Scrying rooms. To counter this deficit, a scrying pool will be createdsomewhere in Tirun which is accessable to all, but will cost money to use andmay be limited in some ways. This will encourage mages, clergy and others withscry to use their abilities.The following is a list of guild requests that ARE allowed:A1 - Guild subhalls can be completely hidden, but the main hall will be reasonably obvious.A2 - 1 treasury deposit spot.A3 - 3 regular shops. (weapon, armour, utility)The following guild request is NOT allowed:A1 - Guild shops for outposts."
