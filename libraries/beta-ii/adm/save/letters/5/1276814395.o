__Letter "Sadly the stroke kinda fucked with my verbalizing an idea soi needed to revise it a little. What im intending is a commandthat would do the following;1) Do a file for file compare of two directories. It would beoptional if we wanted it to be recursive( sub-dirs included) ornot.2) The command would then generate two files named\"old.<targ_file>\" and \"new.<targ_file>3) These 2 files would be deposited into a named directory ordefault to a pre_named one.4) A second command could then collate the files or we can mearlyuse ed to insert the differences in their proper places. #1 to 3would have done the leg-work of sifting out the changes for us.<targ_file> is the original filename.I am pretty confident that i can streamline this using mappingsso that the updating would map out its own variance between thetwo mud versions. The second command would allow once shot coallation of the files if we see variances one way but not theotherAim and fire is my intentions here."
