__Letter "It seems that it's been spreading around that I am the alt of Theres, whoever the hell that used to be.  I double checked to make sure that he didn't mean hermes by asking who Theres was, and he said I don't know as opposed to correcting me thusly I know no typo was made.  Anywa, I've been thinking all night about forming our own mercenary guild and I want to go over some things with you later tonight.  I think our primary concern at all times is we not reveal ourselves to be alts... But in any case, I'll catch you tonight"
