__Letter "Hey there.Figured I would be the nice guy and inform you that I am leaving.Astrid was removed from the guild, and I have no desire to remain in any guild without my wife.As well, simply mudding here has no interest anymore.I would just like to thank you for the efforts you put in, as well as the other various leaders.Thanks for your time, and I hope that you have good luck in the future.~Beleqwaya Melamin"
