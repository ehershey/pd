__Letter "Hello Admin Nightshade,Today on trying to log onto Drayven, my alternate character account I came to find that he was deleted. It is confusing really, I thought we registered the lan and everything correctly as you told us we needed to. Turns out we must have messed up somewhere for this to happen. Sorry that my brother and I don't have a computer at our primary residence that we can use instead of the public library and their computers. Hopefully everything will be corrected or something. My email is johnphillips977@hotmail.com, sorry to have taken up your time to bring this to your view.Sincerely, John"
