__Letter " Each city could have a town crier that sits in the square of the city. When someone lvl 5 or under walks into the toom, he would send that person a tell saying that he's the town crier and that he has some quests he can send you on if you <tell crier quest> \"<tell crier quest> would also be in the mobs desc, for those over lvl 5.So when you tell him \"quest\" he starts sending you tells, I dont really feel like writing all of this up so you can use your imagination as to what he says.Something along the lines of \"I'm the Tirun town crier, i've been lookin for a strong lad/lass to help me out with a few things\"\"First these pesky puma's have been eating my livestock, go to the forest north of tirun and get me the scalps of 5 pumas\"\"There's a crazy guy west of town causing trouble and murdering guards, go kill him and bring me his jacket as a sign of his demise\"\"I need some armor for my wife, go out to the tirun jungle and grab me a tortoise shield, a spear and some amazon armor\"\"Those damn dirty rats have been chewing at my walls, go down into the sewer and bring me back 5 dirty rat scalps!\"\"my wife is very fond of rose petals, bring me some and i'll reward you\"So you can fine tune those however you want, but the basic point is that EVERY major city would have one, and each would have his own unique quests. The rewards would be gold, I suggest a sort of crumbling pyramid of gold as a reward, you can do each one like 5 times, but each time you get a little less, and after 5 you cant do them anymore. But the rewards should be good, I mean like 2000 gold for the first 5 puma scalps, 1500 for the second set 1000 for the third set etc etcbut the puma's would be like the lowest paying ones, basically if you do all the quests from 1 crier you'll get at least like 40k or something.. newbies and people who just arent very good would benefit greatly from making money easy enough, and plentiful enough to allow them to exp at a rate that will provide results, so they'll play more.. Lord knows without vast sums of money I probably wouldnt even play heh. Oh and of course the harder the area of the city, the greater the rewards.. And anyone can do the quests, lvl doesnt matter, but you can only do each 5 times...Might help root out some cheaters too, make some examples out of people.. if some newbie thinks he's smart and he's gonna just do the easy quests a million times on diff alts and switch the money over, it would be real obvious.I have many more ideas if you want me to send more"
