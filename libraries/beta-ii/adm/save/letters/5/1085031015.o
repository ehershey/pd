__Letter "passageI was wondering.. Did you arrest Kumi for the post that she posted? Because I first read that post and thenI read her post then I read that she was removed, and she said she was removed for disrespecting an immortal. I asked hey why shewould post something like that about your fun mud, and she said she didnt even read your post, she was posting about Daboura'spost about interesting topics actually being on the board.I just wanted to let you know that she wasn't trying to be impudent or anything, she was just responding toDaboura's post, because she doesnt like big posts and most of the time doesnt even read them, but does read little posts.Thank you very much for reading that. If however, it is not about the post, sorry for wasting your time, but thanks anyway for taking your time to read my mail"
