__Letter "%^RED%^This room is painted a dark black, lit by a series of torches in open-skull holders, the flames of which seem to cower away from the centre of the room, although there is no breeze or wind to speak of in this area. A large double bed rests in the middle of this place, a thick black blanket resting over it, decorated with silver thread wound in a spider-web pattern. A small chest rests to one side, bearing the label 'Toys'."
