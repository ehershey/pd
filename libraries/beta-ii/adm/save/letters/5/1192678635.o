__Letter "Hey Samantha, this is Justin. Remember Josh's friend? I played Joker and my most recent character is Halucoost.....But I quit for a while and forgot my password on Halucoost. I was wondering what the recovery for those things are and if you could help me out. Im asking you because I know you and I know you are more active then the rest of the immortals to my knowledge. If its just sending the PW to the email as long as the email has expiration date or something like that in it I can get it like that. If it isnt let me know and I guess im just out of luck.Thanks,Justin"
