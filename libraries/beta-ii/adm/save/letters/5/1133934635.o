__Letter "Well, ok, since there is no leader board in the Last Saints Guild Hall, Whit took me to a board so that I can read your post.  I can't post there b/c I dont have a board, so I am mudmailing you it instead. oils and stones and ointments..I think they should be made better for people within guilds.  Here is my reason, most of the players that are most active on PD are in guilds.  So the most active players should have better oils/stones/ointments in thier guild...not TOO MUCH better though.  I would say, double what the regular healing items do.  With that, I think that all guilds should have to boot people from them, if say they have not been on at all within...3-6 months and beyond.  That way, they can clear out the people not playing and make room for those who are.  If those players do come back, they can be put back in in an instant.Another idea, I think that the swords and staffs and daggers and spears or whatever each guild has, SHOULD be able to have specials on them.  I think they should all be coded almost EXACTLY THE SAME.  that way they are more fair from guild to guild.  BUT, I dont think they should be the strongest weapons in the mud. Like take a little bit higher than hm dager or sword or whatever the case may be, and make it = to that.  so say sword, make the guild swords = to say the orange cutlasses, b/c you use those at lvl 25ish, and then you have crystal swords and starscreams better (that are already in the game) not to mention new swords in my area about to come out that are better (if they are not changed).Ok, about things that were taken out of the guilds in the first place.  Scry rooms, I think they are both good and bad, I am not going to lie to you.  I think they are good, b/c it balances the fact that not everyone can scry on thier character, and the way they were designed, you can only see the area they are in and not the room...so even if you use it, you still have to search for them.  My reservation with them is, it IS a class ability.  Portals, I think each guild should be allowed portals...BUT!!!! there NEEDS to be a cap on the places and how many places they can have.  Here are my thoughts.  I think every guild should have a portal BUT, they should only be allowed 2 areas on that portal other than tirun or thier hall.  I dont think ANY islands should be allowed on these portals: aka, merk, rhondale, purgatory, my new area etc..  BUT the places I think they should be allowed to chose from is: Lodos, Tenebrae, Roston, Helgrath, Corinthor.  B/c it doesnt take too much longer to walk there, or to break a seal to these areas.  PLUS if you only allow 2 of these areas, Everyone is still going to have to be able to walk from roston to tenebrae to lodos etc...So they still have to learn the mud, but there are a couple places they can use portals to.  Prayer rooms, I dont see the problem in having prayer rooms in guilds.  it is not like you are going to come back there after every fight to have full hp, I think we should be allowed to have Pray rooms.Armour wise, as far as armour goes, I dont think we should have our arour better than anyone elses, outside of guilds.  I dont think they should be shit armour though.  When a person is in a guild, they like to show pride in it.  I dont think they should be fantasitc or even great armour, i just think they should be to say a lvl 20 or 25 piece of armour in the game.As far as the cap on guilds, I think there should be a cap of 20-30 characters.  B/c the mud isnt THAT active right now, and it allows some room to add alts and things like that.please let me know what you think of all of these ideas, thanks.carina"
