__Letter "Ilithyd attacks you!Bones...bones everywhere... And a single solitary figure      |         sitting in the center of everything. A crack of a bone and    |        his head darts up, eyes narrowing on the intruder as he       |     [X]rises.  The woods seem to close and form a tight circle       |        sealing the prey in... but wait, there is one way out and it  |         might be the only hope. The stench of decay hangs heavy.The slow, eased sound of breathing.There are no obvious exits.Ilithyd: The Demon Hunter (dying)hp: 547|sp: 304|mp: 610 >  You hit Ilithyd ineffectively in the torso.You are too slow this time!You decide to daydream a moment instead of attack.You feel more experienced for the kill. (155,000)Ilithyd drops dead before you.fIlithyd removes his blood wings.Ilithyd unwields Warblade (wielded).Ilithyd unwields Warblade (wielded).You sacrifice the corpse to the gods.You find 5 platinum coins on the body.You find 500 gold coins on the body.You get Blood Wings from the corpse.You put Blood Wings in a Black Diamond.You get Warblade from the corpse.You put Warblade in a Black Diamond.You get Warblade from the corpse.You put Warblade in a Black Diamond.eat me!"
