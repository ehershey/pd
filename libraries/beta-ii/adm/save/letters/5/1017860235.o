__Letter "I'm sorry to interrupt in you no doubt busy schedule. But I've just discovered that my character has not been altered due to the changes (I am told). Apparrently I'm supposed to have Faith as well as belief, and I doubt have ranged as a skill at all, not that I'd use it. It's just that as I mentioned the other day, I can't cast limbs with 210 belief because 'I'm not faithful enough to do that yet' and I only have belief and not faith.get angreal from diamondrub angrealI'm guessing I just haven't been updated to some new changes or something like that. Also I've just been reminded, I haven't got replace or resurrect yet, however Besnell at 30 does. I was just hoping to get whatever the problem is fixed so I can continue playing properly.Oh and one more thing. Gabriel has all the new fighter skills, ferocity, discipline, valor. I'm guess this might be related to the same problem.Thanks for your HelpHalo"
