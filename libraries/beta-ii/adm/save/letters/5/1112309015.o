__Letter "i still havnt worked out the mail thing yet hehe.As far as the Centaur Claddings go i think they might be Forsaken armour, im not sure, i know that most of thier armour and items are only wearable by guild members so that kinda sucks but, oh well. i dont know of any leg mail of any sort for centaurs out there in the world but if it is out there then it must be useable by all centaurs, we just have not found it yet :).if you happen to get keen and feel like wipping up some basic light armour leggings for Centaurs that would be awesome, even if they were the equivelent of those tail ties you made a while back, it dosnt need to be much at all just something so we arnt naked in the leg department hehe.Anyways ill keep my ears peeled ill let you know if i hear of anything :)Paranoia - Keeper of The Light..."
