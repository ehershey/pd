__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Kaster to Hepualahaole Mon Sep 13 00:02:09 2004:-----The new changes that daos wants to implement are stupid moronic and insane. Those guild were bought using hard earned money by guild members and written by guild members.I can understand why you guys would want to change things due to the cheats by the other guilds, and I say this with experience: Not all the guilds have cheated by using items or halls!I can personnally attest to this since i did most of the guild forming when it was in its infancy. There are 2 guilds i can clear from wrongdoing with halls and eq, those are Unholy and Darksouls. To my knoledge, these guild have not conducted in illegal activities.Unholy, for one, has not expanded since it was first written, they have only one guild item and hall, with no weapons whatsoever. Darksouls has not changed since i wrote it! I know that for a fact since i have recently been in both.All the changes for the other guild have been through coercion of immortals and the corruption of certain immortals through their affiliation of players in other guilds. Appearantly those immortals have been punished, but the guilds have been mostly left alone. I suggest that you destroy the guilds that have cheated with upgraded weapons and so on and leave the other guilds alone.Unholy, and Darksouls should not be touched, and neither should any other guild that has not had the privilage of having an immortal friend put in uber powered weapons or halls in places there should not be halls.I hope you listen to meKaster aka Wraith aka Chris Harris"
