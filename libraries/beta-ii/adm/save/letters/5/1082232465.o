__Letter "Hey NS-First off, what I say here, if it stresses you out even slightly, don't evenbother acknowledging this mudmail.  I  can  take it to another admin just aseasy as I can take it to you.Before I get to the point of the mail,  I'm  going to let you know why it isthat I go to you before everyone else.  There's  actually  a lot of reasons,but I'll  try  to  just  list  a  couple  things  so  this  mail  isn't toooverwhelming.Firstly, and most importantly, I don't have much of a personal  relationshipwith you. I don't even address you as Paul, I always refer to you, even whensomeone discusses you with me, as NS or Nightshade. The reason this keeps mecoming to you is,  the other imms/admins that I have personal  relationshipswith, come to me for help all the time, mostly with personal problems.  Oncethe relationship came to that point where I was being their ear, I no longerfelt comfortable ging to them with problems on the mud. I guess it's becauseI knew that they were going through  a lot in real life, and I actually knewwhat those  things  were.  With  you,  I  can only assume that you're goingthrough a lot.  I  don't  actually know  if you really are, or what it is ifthere is anything. Also, I'm always careful about where I tell you anything,I try  to  make  sure that you're around on the mud when I ask you anythingabout it, that way you don't have to interrupt yur real life for mud issues.I am  not kissing ass, so don't get a swelled head.  Secondly, you and Whitare the only people that I think are truly competant enough to fully grasp adeeper understanding of whatever the problem that I have may  be.  The otheradmins, are never around, so there's not too much of a point for me to go tothem, and...you  know how I feel about the current Immortal situation, so Iwon't go there.  However, Whit has a really rough time dealing with his reallife, I think he's jus at a rocky point in life and isn't really very stableat times.  I don't know how volatile he could be, so I'd rather just not sayanything to him, unless he seems to be in a good mood. As for you, from whatI've ever seen, you are very level-headed.That's basically  it,  in  a  nutshell. I don't want you to think that I ampurposely going out of my way to completely ruin your  mud-experience.  I'venever (believe it or not) tried to piss you off. I rarely argue with people.If I  actually  do  argue,  there are two reasons I do this.  Either I'm socompletely bored that I actually think arguing with someone, even if I don'treally disagree with them, will be fun,  or, I actually think if I engage inan argument with that someone, it'll somehow hange things. Either I'll learnsomething, or they will,  or we both will.  Otherwise,  I  pretty much justavoid conflict like that.  When  I argue with you, it's not to make you mad,or to make you feel like I think I'm the almighty mighty word in everything,and you  don't  know  shit,  it's  because either I want to understand yourreasoning, or  I  want  you  to  understand mine. It's important to me thatmiscommunication doesn't occur. But, it always does with you and I.  Most ofthe time,  after  a  small  argument with  you,  I  usually come to a betterunderstanding of whatever it was we argued over, and I thank you, apologize,and walk away.Alright, and now, the real  point of this mail.  :)  Sorry for going on thattangent beforehand.  Well,  a player  on  pd, Agent (Mazrim), used to be inEthereal. He left Ethereal to join Forsaken  so he could team with  them inkilling Illuminati  members.  However,  after  he  left,  he  also  startedattacking Ethereal members.  I  thought  nothing  of it. He ended up killingprobably over 6  of  them.  One night he and Seth teamed up and followed thesmaller members  of Ethereal around the realm, and they slaughtered them allIt didn't hit me at the time,  but what  Agent has been doing (he still doesit 'til  this day,  yesterday he  PK'd Posenda for being a  newbie & and anEthereal member) is going on a PK  spree  for  about  a few weeks now.  He'sdied quite a bit due to  this, either  he'll attack the  wrong member, or hegets sentenced to death. I didn't know that was against  the rules, but thismorning I  did  <help pk>,  because  I  was  trying to  find out  about themurdering offences...and  I  read that players will be dested if they go onthis \"spree\". I've asked my members to post on the Ethereal board if they'vebeen PK'd by Agent, to try to  include a date/time, and the number of  timesthey've died to him, as well as  if they know anyone  else who has been PK'dby him. I'm doing this because I think it will make it easier on you to makea decision. As I said in the beginning of this mail,  if you feel stressed/aggrivated inany way over this,  please  don't  even bother  thinking about it.  I  won'tbother you again on this subject.  If you decide Agent doesn't deserve to bedested because of this, I won't argue you on it, you have my written word onthat. If I do not hear back from you at all on this matter in three days, Iwill take the matter to another admin, so you don't have to deal with it.Thank you,Kumi"
