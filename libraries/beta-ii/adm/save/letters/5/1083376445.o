__Letter ":lets out a small cursejacie would like me (and i think i'll need daos' and venenum's help on this) to code a birthday present for aziraphale. its a bunch of 20 roses, but each rose is custom and says a different thing on it, like '20 reasons i love you' or whatever. thats her quote :Pwas wondering if it was do-able (i think it sounds like it is), and how much she'll have to pay for it"
