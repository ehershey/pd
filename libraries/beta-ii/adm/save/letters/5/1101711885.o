__Letter "Hey,I need 'owner' status back for Unholy.  I remember explaining to Azire and Whit and I think you over AIM/MSN that Unholy was in Furion's hands until I could connect to PD again.No one contacted me to say that the ownership rights went to Set.  It would have been easy for anyone to do this.I've owned Unholy for like, ever.  I remember winning it in a competition a long time ago where guild ideas were submitted and I got it because I was the only one.It seems totally unlike PD for this to happen, since taking something away without asking for it is basically stealing.  I admit that is the right of the staff members, and I respect your decisions, but with all respect I want my guild back.Again...  I have Azire, Stormy, Daos, Seeker and Whit on my AIM/MSN contacts, and no one told me that my inactivity was a problem, or that Furion was inactive as well.  If I had of known that the ownership would be taken from him and given to Set, I would have tried to connect on someone else's computer and tried to deal with the situation.Please return ownership of Unholy to me.Leviathas"
