__Letter "Couple quick stats on gore:My gore does approximately the same damage as my slash (with demonstrength i have 494 attack and 124 strength btw). The difference in the damage between the two is 3%Slash takes on average 100-110 sp.  Gore takes 215-225 sp.If I exp with gore I make 3 million less per hour than i do when using slash.Massacre does about 35% more than my slash but with two rounds and losing idle hits, I only ever use it against newbies in arena for novelty.Please look into demon abilities. Gore was the reason I bacame demon in the first place, and as it is now I exp faster using jab than gore.Thanks,-- Vyce"
