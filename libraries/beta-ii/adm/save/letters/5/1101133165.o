__Letter "Lo Storm, I havent logged on for alittle bit, but when i did i found that my guild had been given away to other players, without even asking me..Id just like to know why this was, as there are 2 other guilds that could have been used (Etheral and Acheron).Im willing to sell the guild to them if they want to purchase it, but i dont think its fair that its just given away. :)I heard it might have been because im inactive, but as i said, there are other unoccupied guilds.. So yeah get back to me on it plsim willing to sell it it."
