__Letter "I need to speak with either Whit or Daboura about the first area,Tirun bay.  There are 3 items i will be leaving to the discressionof the administration concerning my area. They are as follows;  (1) Whit and Daboura both expressed concern over the sp_signet.c      for the quest in Tirun bay healing 1% of the player's max_hp      every heart_beat(). I have therefor modified this and      included a governor in the program that will allow how often      the healing will go off. It is currently set at 1% of the      player's HB every THIRD heart_beat() but can be adjusted      up and down at will. Feel free to lengthen the cycle if you      desire but please leave it at the 1% of max_hp. I want it      to affect those with higher HP better then lower HP.         (a) The ring WILL self-destruct if someone who has NOT             solved the quest attempts to wear one of these rings.         (b) The ring is worthless and can not be sold to stores.         (c) They CAN replace the ring if lost but it will cost             them another Blue Pearl which is at odds of 500:1             against coming out and worth 1,000 gold.         (d) I have included a quest-rule right ON the ring that             forbides its sale or trade to ANYONE.      As you can see, I have made the security on this quest item      EXTREAME to say the least.   (2) The octopi can have up to 8 tenticles. I would perfer this be       left as is. I was trying for the \"shotgun\" mentality here and       would rather see their WC lowered then their numbers reduced.   (3) Stripper_bass.c       This is the high-end monster for Tirun bay. It is a bit higher       in levels and power compared to the other monsters in the area       I therefore have a random number of fillet.c pop on the monster       which is a food item.Sincerely   Ironman"
