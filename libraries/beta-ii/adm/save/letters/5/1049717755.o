__Letter "I was just wondering if rubicante's personnal funds could be donated to the vorticon guild.. he was our kin afterall. I was pretty sure the same thing was offered with Ashran's funds when he was ridded and was just wondring if it could be. It would be nice if it could. Thats all. Just a yes or no reply would be nice thanks. =)"
