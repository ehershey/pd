__Letter "Hey,I quess i just wanted to say that, i realise that its my fault that tauran got dested by owning the lan and letting Dace play on it, but i spose the reason of this mail was to ask if Tauran could be undested?I was really looking forward to playing him after he got unarrested because me and genocide realised what we did wrong and we were kinda upset that we didnt read the lan rules before applying for it, and i was just wondering if he could be?Please reconsider,Illador."
