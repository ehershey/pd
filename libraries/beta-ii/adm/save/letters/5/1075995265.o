__Letter "after a hundred years of living among her own kin, the elf child with green eyes senses she must leave to study among other who may not neccesarily be her own kind. Journeying from her home in the tiwn of Silverymoon, in the Silver Marches, the child, whom we shall now call Mialee, searched for what she hoped would be her calling, her path through life. Finally her journey came to its next Act when she enter the Kingdom of Amn, discovering the monasteries there, finding a taste of the peace and knowledge she longed for. Learning and studying in the ways of the monk for many years, Mialee found the courage and strength to voyage out of her new home to discover the world at large."
