__Letter "I think Aciri is pretty much toast now.  The reason is that I can't code, and when I actually could, I was like the worst builder ever.I'm willing to write all of the descriptions for an area, but I can't deal with the coding aspect.If you can find someone who wants to team up with me to transfer all of the writing (which I'm good at) into an area, cool, but otherwise...  Aciri is not going to happen.Lev"
