__Letter "Hmmmmm I heard that you guys really lowered static shield, making it last like one round and stuff. I know you guys did it to buffer, but thats allright cause it was overpowered.But static shield used to last forever and I do agree that it should have been lowered, but not so much as it only lasts one round, 4 to 6 rounds would be better with a little less armour on it. but not so much as to make it a useless spell like buffer."
