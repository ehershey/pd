__Letter "There's a major bug with harass log... if you turn it on as an immortal (IE Venenum) you break the MUD and nobody can use lines or shout... I've logged off as Venenum for the time being, but this is a rather serious problem... I'll log back on after reboot or after you've mailed me back. -- Venenum."
