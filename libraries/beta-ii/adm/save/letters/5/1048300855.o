__Letter "Well I know that he left Illuminati because he was so angry. I guess he joined Forsaken because he needed/wanted to be in a guild. Forsaken is also made up of the other half of people in Darwin that play here, but those guys are mostly fools. He might have joined them because they have a sort of Rivalry with us.He was *very* pissed off after Drakule got to 100 before him, and that we didn't tell him about it. I would have said something if Drakule had said not to tell anyone about it.How annoying that is. If I tell Gabe, then I go against Drakule, but if I keep the secret then I go against Gabe.I can't think of why he would be ignoring you. Does he know you by this alt, did you tell him who you were? He might have tellblock on...Hmm, Illuminati had Gabriel, Drakule and I. But I left and so did Drakule, and Gabriel is going to stop playing soon. Everyone just ended up getting sick of PD, mostly because Storm was downgrading our characters so much.I can think of 2 reasons more why he would join Forsaken. (1) They are going to participate in PK and he wants to blow people away. (2) He gave his character away, though I seriously doubt that one.The email you got, I wrote that last night when I was tired and worried about what you were thinking of my 'journal'. I meant to fix it up so it wasn't so bad this morning, but as soon as I loaded up outlook it sent the mail.You didn't send an email did you? It might not receive them while the isp account is deactivated.That's all I can think of for the moment.Until next we meet Princess,     Jon"
