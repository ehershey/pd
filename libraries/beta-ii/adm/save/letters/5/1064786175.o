__Letter "Weelll...  I just thought I'd let you know I finished up that webpage I showed you.  I've got a few pictures up on it, none of me, though...  I'm always the one with the camera.  Oh well.  So did you manage to get some rest last night?  or did you end up staying up and having a good time?  I hope you're doing well, either way.  I think tonight will be a long night at work, so I'll probably be sleeping tomorrow afternoon...  I'll be on later in the evening I bet.  Take care.                            -Paul"
