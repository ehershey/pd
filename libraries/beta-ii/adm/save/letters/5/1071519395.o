__Letter "Name: Gypsy CurseReason: Gypsies are notorious for bad tempers and being easily offended.  Gypsies should have a \"curse\" of sorts that can only be placed and removed by the gypsy that placed it or another with the same skills/abils.Effects: Something along the lines of adding body damage through combat or a set amount of lowered con or char.Look: <gypsy name> calls upon his/her ancestors and brings down a curse upon you! (I'm not feeling really creative atm so maybe you can tweek that a bit to be better) then to remove it \"You feel the heavy burden lifting as <gypsy name>'s curse is removed from you.\"Stats: It would be awesome to make this a level 20/25 abil but set it according to the wis or char of the gypsy as compared to the person they are trying to curse.  Or you can do it based on skills.. maybe clairvoyance or entertainment.Really.. gypsies can be good but they just aren't we need something to give us an extra edge or something.  Having this curse increase body damage after it has been placed (either out of combat or in) would be curable by the person it's been placed on so it's not too detrimental.. more of an annoyance really.  Just something to make people have a bit more respect for us as a subclass.Not sure if that's what you wanted.. but yeah..Sugar"
