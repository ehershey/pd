__Letter "Love, please forgive me. I didn't know things were as serious as they were. Part of it was probably you not wanting me to worryabout you, but please don't try to shield me. Also, yes, I'd dowhat Trevor says as much as possible. If you feel up to it andthe warden allows *winks*, then maybe you could drop a brieftiny mail. We'll work something out. I know we will. I had nightmarestonight. Probably out of guilt. :( So, I will try to be betterfor you. KNow that I love you and want what's best before the restand that is rest...right now. :D So, rest, love, keep fighting.Our love will endure as will you, My Rayna. :)Loving you always,James"
