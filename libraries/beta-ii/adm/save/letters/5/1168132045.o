__Letter "I gotta work in the morning tomorrow from 10a to about noon EST.I should be on about 1pm.We need builders to be brought back up tho :(I mailed you about what was wrong with simul_efun.cAll you need to do is put test_array.c before the security_screen.cin the simul_efun.c and then throw the switch. The port will be fineonce that editing of simul_efun is done.Ironman"
