__Letter "Hi, I was trying to come back onto the mud, and wanted to stay friendswith you and Yang.  Maybe I'm too sensitive about stuff, but that's theway I am.  Anyway, I'm not sure how it will go with Adila even, and the time I do haveto play, I have been on WoW and pop in here.  But, real life has becomereal busy now, so what for it's worth - I valued you and Yang.  PerhapsI took what he said the wrong way, but that's the problem with onlineconversations, they tend to get messed up.Unless Endy comes back on, I doubt I will return as Adila.You're a wonderful guy and deserve someone who appreciates you.Love, Rayna:)"
