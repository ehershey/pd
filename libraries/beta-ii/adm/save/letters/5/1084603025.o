__Letter ":lets out a small curse//Please note the code 'is all in fucked up directories and there is old code in the 'new' directory' Venenum.--> /d/guilds/newethereal/arm/the belt is still unacceptable.well, at least this time they put a value and a mass to the blue scalemail boots. except that the highest boot AC in the mud is 7, with boots from purgatory. Now i don't mention tattered boots from Purgatory, because they have a mass of 195 and you have to be oer lvl 89 to wear them, to be Worthy of the AC of 12. and yet ethereal can just Have these boots with AC of 9 and a mass of Only 17.elite armour for centaurs and raknids = ok, except...the value of the raknid armour should be increased, because 120 gold is too little for a piece of armour that gives you 11 AC. upon noting this, though, it should also be noted that forsaken's rmail (raknid mail) has a AC of 15 and only weighs 60 while ethereals has a AC of 11 and weighs 100. Forsaken's Mail should be increased in weight and the AC should be reduced, because Nothing Should have an Extra AC of 15 to their arms (all four of them) legs (all four of them), abdomen, torso and still be able to slash through mobs with ease. At least ethereal had the brains to include that those under lvl 49 cannot wear their raknid and centaur armour.AC 3 is a bit much for a silk kimono.I am still disagreeing with the aurorean Mask, because it has an AC of 4, okay, fine, 4 is better than 5, but its weighs NOTHING. it weighs 1! 1! you may as well let it have no weight at all, because thats about the significance of a weight of 1.the shield...lets see..first of all, it uses azire's name in the conclusion that kumi is smacking azire upside the head. like that's right. second, it is ARMOUR and ARMOUR does not para for a round or two, No Armour In The Entire Mud Does That. and it also has a 22% Chance to do this?! No. That is wrong. and look: it's only worth 100 gold. imagine that. PLUS it gives an AC of 4.I still think guilds having tail or horn armour is wrong. It should not be allowed.a Kilt with no mass?! give me a break. i don't care if it has no armour or Weapon class, it has no mass, and no value. it should either be removed or fixed. the same with the shield.The wingmail still has an AC that is too high for something that does not para when worn or removed and can be worn at all times, even to fly. ethereal itemsA bracelet, like i said last time, should have more than an AC of 3 with a weight of 1.the coat of arms is COMPLETELY HACKLESS. I shouldn't be allowed, and as Venenum has said to me, any armour which gives magic protection should only give 1 all over, because otherwise its just too stupid.the holy ring and the evil ring is also ridiculous. Rings which alter your alignment, only to This Guild, so that these players never have to go to a pool, or kill only good/godly mobs. This gives EThereal an Unfair advantage not only over other guilds, but over Everyone Else in the Whole Mud.WEAPONSPlease Note: Onlythe alchymia gives a 3 round para ON an 85% chance. Anyone see a problem with that? Has an AC of 2, Weapons class of 9, can be wielded in only one hand, only weighs 10 and only costs 120 gold. Venenum suggests, and i agree, that the rounds of para shouldn't be a 3 round certainty, but random(3).A Dagger with a Weapon Class of 14?! only weighs 13?!The Eidolon blade now has a WC of 14 instead of 13 like the old one, and it only weighs 0. yes thats right, nothing, zero, nada, squat.The elite axe paralyzes for 2 rounds, has a WC of 13, and the special of 2 rounds para is on a 15% chance.elite flail with WC of 13, has a 1 in 5 chance of specialing, and then a 1 in 4 chance of para for 2-3 rounds.an elite knife, which is actually a sworf (cutlass' are not knives) with a WC of 13, and can para up to 3 rounds on a 15% chance.a hm axe that can be used with only 50 axe? has a WC of 10, and only weighs 7? Errrr, Bad. also, has no autoload.the virtuoso blade is actually okay. its a good example of a guild blade. omg.//the please note should have been....Please NOte: All of the elite weapons paralyze, which i see is a way for these guild members to get around the para abilities of some classes having been disabled. I think this is wrong."
