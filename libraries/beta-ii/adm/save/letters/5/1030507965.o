__Letter "Well, from what I understand and from what stormie as said to me before. PVP COMBAT damage will be reduced so that people 20 lvls in difference will not kill one another in one rounds (that was posted on the board)As far as the actuall PKing, a PK death will probably be worked to do about 20 precent less to a players character. Which COULD mean they lose 2 lvls instead of 3 and 100 skill points instead of 450 or something along that line. Its not a completly free death.My words said in this mail should NOT be taken as what WILL happen to the players Death damage."
