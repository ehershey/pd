__Letter "OK, here are 2 ideas I was batting around for guild items.1. Ok, so how about an amulet that puts up a damage reflecting shield up, some percent of dmg that is taken, by either spell or physical attack would be reflected back at the attacker. I can understand that it would not be a large percentage, but big enough to be noticable to the player wearing it.Of course, the amulet would have to have a time limit.2. A crystal that could absorb life energy and store it for the players use. SO it would act like this: You walk in to a room, with, say, 4 mobs, lvl like 30. I command the crystal to start gathering energy, which would cause all the mobs in the room to attack me, and with each round, say like 3, the crystal would be absorbing enerygy from the mobs, maybe make it drain mp, so it doesn't actually hurt the mob at all. And of course, while draining, the player would be paralysed. The crystal would store the taken \"energy\" as just a number in memory. And depending on what lvl of the mob, a certain amount of energy would be taken, so the higher the lvl mob, the more energy taken per tick. So now we have just a number in memory, which would indicate how much \"energy\" is in the crystal. The player could then take energy from teh crystal in any form nessisary, meaning hp/sp/mp. And each type would take a different amount of energy from the crystal. Like hp would take more energy then mp, and such. So if I went through, say the lodos temple, and absorbed as much energy as I could, I could use that energy for some time xping for a while, hopefully :)So anyway, feedback is welcome!Daboura, GM of the Dragon warriors!"
