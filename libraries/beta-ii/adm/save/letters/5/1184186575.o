__Letter "Hey dude, for some reason I cant copy and paste to through the java telnet.  The best way to get the wav file is to go to Dogpile.com click on the Audio and search for Final Fantasy Victory... You should be able to listen to them straight from that site... If this doesnt work, send me a mail dude, ill see what else i can do.Peace Orch dude!"
