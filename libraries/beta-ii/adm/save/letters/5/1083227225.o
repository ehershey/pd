__Letter "A very interesting and unique idea. :D I'll run the concept past Nightshade and start work right away. I like it. As for actually hurting everyone in the room with spells, that's not quite possible, but the spell's effects can be mimiced (using the same messages, same formula, etc) however such a spell would have to abide by the balance rules regarding room damage. I don't see that as an issue, however. Thanks very much for this idea! I'll get back to you when I have more progress on it. :D As a side note, the gypsy abilitity 'flick' requires money, too. :) -Venenum."
