__Letter "The following piece of paper mysteriously appears in your mailbix, addressed to you. It appears to be a public notice of some description, although no return address is included.<The paper is brown and tattered as though many years old. There is a message scrawled on it, in what looks to be ash or charcol. The handwriting is appalingly bad, and extremely messy, as though the message was scrawled with a stick instead of being written by a fluent quill. It is first written in Dragonian, and then again in Selunian.>Ja'fgezppfew kj morrtilreezzr! Gewa wre'ddzz mowaf'dd'gezeeel hhzittbill'in ka'dr fezzzurriel kilzttain' fa dofew.
