__Letter "i know you busy and all, but me and endy have been talkin and we came up with an idea. Was thinkin at around lvl 40-50 druids should get a resonate for int and wis, and it would be cool if at lvl 40-50 if druids could resonate themselves when in a party as well as party members. it would be like the druid mastered the art of nature around that level range and could resonate themself, if that makes sense. and maybe a new attack spell. if thats not possible thats fine, but the resonate ideas would be a great present for that level range.Thanks,       Zub"
