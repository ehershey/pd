__Letter "Daos filled me in on our problem retaining players.. We're making the newbie quest to try and ease players into the MUD more, based on the assumption that new players are too overwhelmed by the MUD at first glance and need to be eased into the MUD easier. However, it may not be the case that this in itself is enough to drive the players to want to keep playing after they get familiar with the game. In some sense, a lot of what PD has to offer is the extensive number of rooms, the huge area to explore, and the very large level range that you can grind through in these areas. One idea I had to help give players an incentive to keep playing was a very long quest chain. This quest chain would span from level 1 to level 75, and through all the major interesting zones. It would present an interesting story line for players to follow, give a good deal of experience and cool items intermittently through the chain, and most importantly, give players a reason to go to the new areas, and some goal to work towards (be strong/high enough level to finish the next part of the quest)."
