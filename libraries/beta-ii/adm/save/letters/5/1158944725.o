__Letter "Are we allowed to have our characters switched to a different one?  Are we allowed to suicide, remort or get dested and banned, and then come back and be restored as the character you wanted?  I was under the impression when I started PD, that if you remort...you're own fuckin fault; if you suicide, that's your own fuckin fault...and if you get banned that is CERTAINLY you're own fault.. I didnt know that we could be restored and given XP, I didnt know that we could be changed from one whole character to another, I didnt know that we could massivly cheat and script and get away with it.  Are we supposed to get away with it?  "
