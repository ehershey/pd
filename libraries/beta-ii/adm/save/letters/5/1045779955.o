__Letter "This is absolutely the most overpowered spell in the game. Ya its a level 50 angel move, but that doesnt mean it should allow the game's entire balance to be thrown off. Holyfire target is as strong as a 4 hit red dragon's flameclaw. Holyfire area is the strongest area attack. And to top it off it takes almost no MP. For comparrison, a lvl 75 with holyfire will make 60 mil an hour. A conventional balanced class will make 20.Holyfire needs to take mp per mob it hits. I dont know how to code that part. The damage is also too high (most damaging spell which also just happens to be an area attack). I have rewritten its code in this form. If you like it put it in. But it is absolutely essential to balance that this spell be changed.Holyfire (non-target) codedmg = tp->query_skill(\"faith\")*2/3;dmg += tp->query_stats(\"wisdom\")*3;dmg +=tp->query_skill(\"magic attack\")*1/3;dmg -= ob->query_stats(\"intelligence\")*2;dmg -= ob->query_skill(\"magic defense\")/3;dmg -= mod;dmg *= 5/4;Holyfire (Targetted) codedmg = tp->query_skill(\"faith\")*1;dmg += tp->query_stats(\"wisdom\")*7/2;dmg += tp->query_skill(\"magic attack\")*1/3;dmg -= ob->query_stats(\"intelligence\")*2;dmg -= ob->query_skill(\"magic defense\")/3dmg -= mod;dmg *=5/4;This also serves to make holyfire (and holyfire defense) more stat based. Thus paladins get what they want in that they can get a stronger holyfire if they put the work in. This is nessissary balance. More so that any other spell. Many players have access to holyfire. The other extreemly overpowered abilities have no one with access to them at the moment. Holyfire needs to change."
