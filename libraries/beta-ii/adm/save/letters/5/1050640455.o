__Letter "I'm the ruler of shovels, I'm as thin as a knife, I have adouble, and I have a wife. What am I?the king of spadesA man comes up to you and says, \"Everything I say to you isa lie\" is he lying or telling the truth?it's a paradoxOnly one color, but not one size,Stuck at the bottom, yet easily flies.Present in sun, but not in rain,Doing no harm, and feeling no pain.What is it.shadow2 out of 3 winsSugarcandy"
