__Letter "Hi, someone who I want to avoid has come back to the mud, so I'mthinking I might make an alt and just let you know.  If you're on here,that would be nice.  My schedule here is crazy at home, with the babyand work and hubby's work, but I'd try to come on.  Also, I will try to geton your MUD as well.  I'll let you know my new alt."
