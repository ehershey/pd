I'll try to be on Sunday night, and maybeSunday morning, but it's very iffy.`P`pBah, still can't get that \"view current message\" command right. It keeps showing up in my e-mail....errr..mails to you. Anyway, see you when I see you.*Savannah kisses you passionately andclasps her hand on your buttocks before pulling away and waving goodbye with a feral grin.*"
