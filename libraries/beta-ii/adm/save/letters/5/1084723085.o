__Letter "this is from Orcha. My opinion on the whole ethereal guild mess is that - I believe that Evolution and Kumi knew their things were unbalanced. At least some of them. Kumi and Evo are both experienced players who know the rules about weapons, items, etc. Although Whit may be at fault for not CHECKING the items forthwith, i believe that he is not the *only* one at fault. Kumi disrespects BOTH Helena and Myself and refuses to allow us to talk in ANY matter concerning Ethereal or Herself. This severely limits what Helena and I are allowed to do and both of us feel much the less for it. Unless something is said to Kumi about respecting immortals and the law, things around here will not be improving anytime soon.-----Original message sent by Orcha to Azire on Sun May 16 04:36:14 2004:-----I have loged a complaint with Venenem conserning anitem that in currently in the posession of Ethereal.The disgust and hate i feel at this current moment is unfathomable. A blatent disregard for respect and maturity.I am backing you fully in any plan of action you wishto take interms of this abbuse and no doubt LIES, as to how in all bloody hell this item was aloud INTO the game.I pitty the fool who coded this item, and am SHOCKEDeven more towards who EVER approved this ITEM.My view of the player Kumi has only been even morerenfoeced by this disturbing matter.I will help in any way i can.Yours FaithfullyOrcha"
