__Letter "I just wanted to add that I love Set and Bellos as co-leaders.  I have no intention of changing that.I also understand the need that was there for new leadership while Furion and I were gone.I understand the need for new leadership, but the ownership never should have changed.  I really want it back.  It makes a difference to me.Leviathas"
