__Letter "I had an idea for a sky for the mud.A sky that works just like the ocean. Demons/Angels/Dragons can, when they jus 'fly', move around the sky as though it were an ocean. The speed with which they move between rooms and the sp cost of moving is based on their flying skill.The sky would be the same size as the ocean, when you move it tells you whether it is ground/water (or a ship) beneath you. Certain locations are points where you can land, and the 8 locations around it say that there is a landable zone in [direction].The sky would be the same size as the ocean, when you move it tells you whether it is ground/water (or a ship) beneath you.

This metal, when magically treated repels ground and water and floats high up in the sky. So the player collects say 100 pieces, or maybe a number pieces with different 'weights' that add up to 100. Then take it to a guy who can magically treat it and create a skyship.Somewhere there could be a 'skydock', a tall tower where people can recall their skyships and 'sail' the sky. When they get to places where angels can land, the people in their ship can 'land', which drops a small boat attached to the ship by a strong group of ropes and pulley, that lowers them to the ground. Later that player can get back into the landing boat and hoist themselves back up to the ship.Angels/Demons/Dragons that enter the same location as players in sky ships can attempt to board them. To get in the players flying skill needs to be measured against say 2.5x the pilots level. Perhaps they could also dive onto ocean boats, with a similar check to attempt.Eventually, for sky and ocean, perhaps there could be war boats, that when in the same location as another players boat, they can attempt to latch on to it with grapples to allow boarding. And sky ships good lower boarding parties on to water boats.Guilds could purchase skyboats for the guild for say 1Mgp, and a dock for 2Mgp. Players who are elite buy their own for 500Kgp each.I'd like to move onto a guild idea (or three). We think it would be cool if we could get pegasi mounts that can fly with us while we ride them.An arena for fighting mobs would be nuff. But you have to earn it. I could make a soul gem, which when used on a monster is dying will capture the monsters body (You won't get exp for it). Then you take the gem back to the arena place and add it to the stockpile. Once you get 10 gems with the same monster in it you can fight the monster in the arena. Note you can still die to these mobs, and you cannot ask for mobs that are above your level.To keep the arena going you must pay 1Kgp/monster/level a month. So if we have 2 20kmobs, 3 40k mobs, a 60k and a 99k mobs in the arena available then it costs 299Kgp/month to keep the arena running. If we dont' have enough gp to keep it running the whole thing is closed down and we lose all the mobs we ahve captured and have to start again.The arena costs say 5Mgp to buy, and the stones for capturing are only available 1 at a time from the arena (1 per reset) and cost 5k gp.This is cool I think because it means I can get the corpses I need for rezzing guild members. You can also fight monsters one on one to see if you can take them on where they are.Finally, can we buy 3 more spheres available in our shop for 450Kgp? (ie 150Kgp for each extra one available, as though it were a seperate item)?At the moment I am in a coding sort of mood. If you like the sky stuff, I'd like to get an arch status or something on builders so I can see the ocean files and create a sky to submit for approval. Haha, I have asked for SO much, you guys are cool to listen to us. Not like some *other* muds I could mention. ;)Till later. - Prator, plz copy area changes :)"
