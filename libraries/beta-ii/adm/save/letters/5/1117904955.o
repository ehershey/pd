__Letter "I'm glad to see your still having a good time. Let me see, whats new around here..... hrm...Well, I guess the biggest thing is that me and 2 other friends started up a buisness together. We deal with advertising and the like, we are just getting started, but have quiet a few prospective clients, so we'll see. School is keeping me busy as hell, but I currently have a 4.0 going, but I'm sure that will change after this quarter, stupid biology, I'm getting the highest grade in the class, and it's still a B :P    Other than that stuff, not much is too new with me. I miss you every day and can't wait to see you again! :)Love Jared :)"
