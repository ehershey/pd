__Letter "camera!  action!  :P  I imagine you're probably off running lights tonight.  Hope it all runs smoothly!  We're probably going to be playing dnd tonight, and I'm not sure when we'll be done.  It's hard to tell with these things, yanno?  *grins and winks*  I'll be sure to pop on as soon as we finish.  And if you DO go to bed, don't hesitate to tell Heath that you're going :P  Love ya!                               -Paul"
