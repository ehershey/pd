__Letter "-----Original letter sent by Mortis to Daos Mon Oct 11 04:54:27 2004:-----Necromancers subclass are very good. The theme it self is very richand allow us to explore the imagination and our worse nightmares tocreate a very interesting role play and environment. With allrespect about PD admins, may i say our necromancer has fails inrole play logic and fails in spell formula it self. Im not complainin style \"Im lazy, i want a uberclass, i want be godly, i have awesome ideas, nobody know this better than me, soon...\"What im trying to said is: \"I liked this mud very much and i wantcontribute to improve it in role play environment, rl socialenvironment, balance and fun\". Forgive me my terrible english.Some times because this personal fail i can sound rude, arrogantor childish :). I want just introduce my self and go directly to2 important points (we build stuffs step by step, and we will havesome years to touch in others points later, isnt?).My name is anna and im 36 years old. Next november i will finishmy master science degree. I play muds about 15-16 years (\"You lie!Muds arent to old...\"- im tired to heard it). I played 10 yearsat BatMud-bac.cs.hut.fi prolly this is the oldiest and biggestactive mud on earth. Is on since 1990. Is a very complex combatsystem, very big spells/skills library and full of rich races andguilds system. I and some fellows are building a mud here in ourcountry in our tongue. Basically from scratch.About the PD necromancers the 2 importants points is:1) The new changes affected heavily the absorb spell. It regen10-30 hp only. It is useless now cuz mobs does this damage PERhit at round while you spend the round casting this spell.At my point of view this spell should change the name to fitproperly the necro role play and this shouldnt be based in magicattack. Necromancy should be the only skill to affect attackspells. I suggest the name draintouch or energy drain for it.2) The deathtouch and shadowburst spell should be based in stats.If it is right now they should be more based. I saying thisbecause i kill the same mob in same number of rounds dont matterif my INT and WIS is 45 or 67. I though 22 pts in these statsshould makes some difference at damage for NPCS, isnt?Another point is shadowburst should be different than deathtouch.They does the same damage (sb is a bit more random and attack undeadstoo-that is the only difference i see).Idea: (Help deathtouch file-The spell causes great damageand leaves the target drained) Maybe deathtouch could drain the SPfrom mobs based in our INT or/both WIS vs mobs DEX and WIS.I will like to touch at others points at future, but i think thistwo abore are enought for now.I hope i had made me direct, clear and no offensive (*Punchesher bad english*)Question: PD still is needing a new web site? Because after novemberi will have free time to work on it. I have very good skills indreamweave, flash animation and photoshop.Best wishes,-M-"
