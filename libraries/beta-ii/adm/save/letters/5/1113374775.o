__Letter "Okay..going to start a fighter to see what its like but am stuck on a name.  I was given 5 names and can't seem to make up my mind.  I'm going to be a centaur and I think a hunter or paladin.  These are the names: Alalanta-goddess of hunt, Senestral, Neith-Egyptian Warrior Goddess, Asir, and Cer-Goddess of Violent Death."
