__Letter "Summary is now complete on the builders site. I might do a bitof tweaking on the outputs but other then that it is all set.I have inserted it into /cmds/creator so all builders have useof it.The command has it's own security system set up in it seperatefrom the EUID system. This is to allow the wizards to have directcontrol over who can use the command on their objects.If you wish to lock out builder use of this command on your objects.mearly add the following function to you workroom.cstring *access_allowed() {return ({ <names> });<names> is an array of the names you wish to grant summary access to.Please use this command and give me feedback on it's outputs."
