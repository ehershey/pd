__Letter "I'm posting this now with little time left online, so please bear with me.  I was Law admin on Zhing for 4 months and before that I held the class admin spot for 2 years.By class admin i mean I was in charge of balance and creation for new spells, abilities, and whole classclass creation I meant.I will admit now that I have a full time job thats third shift, and have free time after work for about 5 hours.Zhing was in LPC so getting back into the swing of things shouldn't be a problem.From what I can tell, Primaldarkness has the potiental to become one of the top MUDs around.  And like Zhing, I'd be proud to help achieve that.Well Zhing was never a top MUD but I hope you got my point.I can fill you in on more later if you consider me. Shinkoro"
