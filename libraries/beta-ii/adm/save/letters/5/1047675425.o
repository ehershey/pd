__Letter "Ok, I finally (after much careful thought) have developed an awesome system for the whole blood drinking process, and how blood is spent.Blood points total = str + dex + con / 10, * 5Everyone would have to have blood points now: this could be an invisible number to all but vampires if you want.A vampire uses up 1 bp per minute, so even the really buff ones with 200 for each con, dex and str can only go 300 minutes before they MUST drink again.  This stresses the need for blood in vampires, and only the absolutely most powerful among them can go through waiting for day to end without being really thirsty for more. When a vampire attempts to drink the blood of a monster, the duration of the blood drinking depends on two factors:1.) Vampire's charisma v.s. monster's intelligence.2.) Vampire's strength and dexterity versus monster's strength and dexterity.I'm not sure how many rounds the above would last but I'll leave that to Balance.Vampires will absorb 10% of their own capacity to hold blood from a target, each round they drink.  -> If the target's total bp is lower than 10% of the vampire's, they die.Vampires also steal a certain amount of stats from the target that they drink from, the length of time that they maintain these stats (and the target loses them) would be the number of blood points taken in minutes.The stats that the vampire takes from their target = target's str + dex + con / 20If the vampire wants a small addition to their power for an extended period of time, they drink a lot of blood from few targets.  If they want a lot of power for a short amount of time, they drink the 10% minimum from a maximum of 10 targets.  The only exception to this 10% rule is if less than 10% remains in the vampire's capacity to hold blood and they choose to drink again.I realize this is one crazily complex system but I really think it works best...  lets talk about it though.Leviathas"
