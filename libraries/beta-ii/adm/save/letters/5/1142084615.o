__Letter "OK this is what i have figured out so far.the function query_body_mapping() reads a mapping contained inside the monster/player object called body.when body[\"limb\"][\"damage\"]=body[\"limb\"][\"max_dam\"]  the limb will fall offwhat i need to know from you guys is how do i use the set command to make body[\"limb\"][\"damage\"] equal body[\"limb\"][\"max_dam\"]I can READ body with query_body_mapping but how do i write to the mapping??Ironman"
