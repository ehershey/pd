__Letter "I want to replace your chipmunks in the newbie forest with /wizards/nesoo/test/chp.c, and add test/town_crier_ring.c (with properly filled in properties, of course) to your npc folder in the newbie forest, let me know if that's ok.This would be for a newbie deed for a town crier that would sit in the tirun []. I can't look right now, but pretty sure he's test/town_crier.cBasically, he would help newbies find common supplies and the newbie leveling area. So far he covers oil, ointment, and the newbie forest, but I plan on adding one for stones as well."
