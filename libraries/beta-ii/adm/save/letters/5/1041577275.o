__Letter "How's it going? I haven't seen you since the server came back up.  :(  I  miss you. According to Aldur, whom i just found out knows you irl, you are just now getting an internet connection. So that I understand. I remember you telling me that it might be a bit before you could get back on. If I'm not on when you get the chance to get online, send me mail so I'll know you're back.  ;)  I'll probably be on my usual times unless i tell you otherwise. Hugs n french kisses,Savannah."
