__Letter "February 18th, 2005My mother, who also works for Macy's was forced to punch out and leave work early because no one else had offered to take me to the hospital or call an ambulance. I arrived at the hospital around 10:45am and gave the packet I was given to the woman sitting behind the desk. She told me that she needed to find out if Macy's required post-accident drug screenings, and then a few minute later told me that I would not be taking a drug test and she gave me 6 pieces of paperwork to fill out. As I began to fill them out, the same woman called me back over and told me that I would be taking a drug test. One of the papers that I was asked to fill out was one of a diagram of the front and backside of a human body along with a legend that explained that various symbols could be used to represent different types of pain and discomfort. I drew a very detailed diagram of where all of the pain I was feeling was, I marked my neck, my teeth, both of my shoulders, my left forearm, my right knee my left hand and my entire back. After I filled out all of the paperwork I waited a few more minutes then one of the nurses called me over to check my blood pressure. After she did that she handed me a plastic cup that I was to fill with urine for my drug screening. I filled the cup, gave it to the nurse and was told to wait in the doctors office. After 5 minutes or so the doctor came into the room, sat down and asked me if I had had an accident. I said 'Yes, a table fell over and landed on my back and neck at work' I was then cut off by the doctor who said \"Oh, so you're canadian huh?\""
