__Letter "Well, I have to be away from the game for awhile.  There are some thingsat home here that I need to work on.  My bf is in the forces and goingoverseas in September, so I have to figure some things out.Wish I could have caught up with you before, even to marry our characters.  I will put in my chfn that my heart belongs to Baradun ifthat's okay.Email me at raynapaisley@yahoo.caLet me know when you might be on, but for now, I'm not sure when I'll beback here.  It might be October and he actually wants to get marriedbefore he heads out.  He wants me to give him my decision by end ofAugust.  Wish me luck.Hugs,Rayna"
