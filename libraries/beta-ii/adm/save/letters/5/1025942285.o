__Letter "When the issue got to you Abzigal started giving a running commentary. Most of the things he saw he said out loud. I don't know alot about it because I was busy playing Blitzball in Final Fantasy X.However, at one point he shouted out that there was no point in arguing because you would probably automatically side with Soulfly. At this point I said out loud \"Yeah, Soulfly will probably win anyway\"It is my opinion, and I realise that you might not appreciate it, which is why I never made an issue about it before, but it seems unavoidable.Let me just go through what I have seen:1) The Soulfly character is 'arrested' for swearing at admins, then abused a bug with the gag to continue swearing at admins after being warned. He was allowed to get his character back after apologising. So basically he had no punishment because he would not say sorry while he was still pissed, but he wouldn't want to play when he was pissed with admins anyway. When he wanted to play again he just had to apologise. He got his character back without penalty.2) Soulfly Character harrasses and pk's me for the second time, going against his role-playing by killing an archangel a second time. I reported it, but I never got an answer from you, even when I directly asked you with a tell when you were not idle. You seemed to be ignoring me, so I left it, since that is your right as an admin.3) Abzigal reports harrassment. The first thing said to him by you: \"So you are both complaining about harrassment\". I know you are showing that Abzigal reported harrassment, but I can already see from that that he will be lying to get your favour in the matter.I know that Soulfly has been lying because he told Wraith that Ancalagon told Abzigal flat out that he would kill him, which he did not.The reason that I didn't jump on my computer is that I still have to save up $1000 to replace parts of my computer. I am using a spare one at Halo's house because friends are staying in the spare room at my house. Abzigal came over to visit and he is using the computer since he can exp and I can't.I was busy playing a game, and I didn't know that Abzigal had said that since he relayed what other people said, he did not say out loud what he was typing.Another reason for my opinion was handling of Ashram, I know he would have harrassed me as much as he could, he has said as much himself. Yet the punishments given were nothing to him. Anyway, that does not matter to *me* anymore.I would just like to note that Soulfly has always been rude, abusive and racist towards Me, Halo and Abzigal all the time. He has been reported for harassment before, and has been abusive to admins before. Though Halo isn't complaing about Soulfly atm, they have owkred that out, though it does not change the way that Soulfly has treated others.Now I must decide whether to suicide my Imm before I get dested, it seems as though I will be dragged into something no matter what, and judging by your mood I don't like my chances.Any issues with this, then talk to me please. - Aziraphale"
