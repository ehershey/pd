__Letter "Hey Paul... hope things are goin' good with you and your job searching. Send me a mail to tell me what's goin' on and how things have progressed. Anyway... to go on from there... I sent you a mail a while back about the bug eating all my stuff... any chance I could get back the rings and 2 diamonds? I mean... at LEAST the diamonds seems fair... I mean, they are hella rare after all. The rings would be nice... as would the rest of my stuff... but the diamonds are the main thing. Anyways... talk it over with the other admins and such if you need to... hit me back with a mail or something... and I'll catch you online later. Chow dude.Ryan"
