__Letter "Ok firstly ignore that previous message, Zmud kinda made meunable to quit from the editor, AnywayUpon recently having an arena battle with Paranoia, I wantedto test the damage of my spells, the first spell i used wasDemonfire, One of my best, If not the best spell i get asa Kataan.So, In i go, And i test the damage, the vitals for me andParanoia are something likeSet: 100 int, 70 wisFaith             195 (16%) 216Magic attack      180 (MAX) 180Magic defense     45  (0%)  54Summoning         186 (0%)  216Demon Kataan, Level 36.Versus:Paranoia: 10 int, 20 wisNo magic defense skillsCentaur Warrior, Level 37So, I cast the spell, and after a round it hits dealing theincredible amazing amount of 265!Now, Upon looking at that, and taking into considerationmy strength Verus Paranoia's strength plus my statsbeing far higher, And my skills too and then alsothe added fact that Demonfire takes a round to hitand is possibly the best spell a Kataan ever getsand then to see it do 265 damage?Doesn't that seem a little.. underpowered in the least?especially versus someone with inferior magic defenseand a warrior too.If you could please do something that would be greatseeing spells on this MUD being mostly underpowerfulthis is why there are so many damned fighters andnot so many magic users.Set - Disgruntled Kataan"
