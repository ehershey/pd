__Letter "Spade/Zack was logged on as Diamond. Noxus says ooh, original name or something like that. Conversation starts to get a lil heated.Diamond then logs off and Zack logs on. Then Noxus sayd on newbieline 'lol I knew it was a douche'. Zack then boots Noxus fromDarksoul for disrespecting him on a public line. ------------------------------------------------------------------I confront Zack. Asking him if he went maybe a little overboard.He gets all pissy and leaves Darksoul after re-adding Noxus andboots himself. I reinstate Zack and let his decision stand forthe moment, but tell him not to take his Darksoul ties so lightlyas to leave over some bs. Also, Noxus was re-booted. I mailed infoto Resolution and so did Zack saying Noxus was Arma and shouldnever have been re-added.------------------------------------------------------------------That next night, there was a huge outcry from everyone in theguild who's active. Apparently, they didn't like Zack powertripping like that over being called a bad name. I took a vote.Everyone thought Zack acted like a douche in booting Noxus andmisusing his powers. So, I re-added Noxus, promoted him to masochist and reduced Zack to sex slave. I figure if you can'tconduct yourself like a leader, you don't deserve to be a leader.-------------------------------------------------------------------Aizen came to Noxus' defense saying Zack was a douche. Then inviteshim to duke it out on merk if he has a problem using a simulatedmerk address. Zack says gimme a real address and Aizen obliges.Then Zack threatens to send people to his house. He also leftDarksoul again and he was not asked to return by myself.-------------------------------------------------------------------Since Lucy hadnt been on since July 11th, I reduced her rank tosex slave. I didn't wanna boot her just yet so she could have a chance to redeem herself. So, that's what's been going on in anutshell. any questions, mudmail me. Cya!-------------------------------------------------------------------Esco"
