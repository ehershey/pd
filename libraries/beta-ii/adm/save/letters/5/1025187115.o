__Letter "this is for the acheron help file:The Acheron guild was formed long ago from two grand people who wanted to make their own society. We are not an Evil or a Holy guild but a Neutral guild who will fight for what they believe in and defend fellow members if must be. To join this guild you must be above the rank of 30 and then be voted in.vote room desc:**Room desc to be light blue in colour***This is not a very big room, a couple of boths stand either side of the room and a small box with a slit for where to place your vote to be counted. A calming dim candle above the box is the only source of light in this room and some vents in the walls bring in fresh air to clear you mind for when you need to vote.well i thinks that's all you needed )"
