__Letter "No worries bro. I got a firm grip on builders for ya until youare free. Just please dont forget about me :) I have most of thetutorial system in place now and i want to show it to you. I thinkya might even want it for referance on the main port once im done.I got alot of cool and obsure coding tricks outlined in there.Hilights are as follows;  1) Full tutorial on the uses of the ?: operator.  2) Tutorials on the for(), while(), and do() loops.  3) Tutorials on if(), else(), and switch/case().  4) Tutorials on the precompiler commands #if, #elseif, #else,     #endif, #ifndef, #ifdef, #define, and #include.  5) Uses and definitions for all the datatypes and operators.  6) Tutorials on coding and calling functions.  7) Tutorials explaining the qualifiers.        Static, nomask, private and varargs and their uses are        outlined.Next I will be moving into filling out the efun, sfun and lfunfiles for the man command. You will find all of these files inthe directory called /doc/coding on the builders port. The_coding.c command is aimed at this directory.Honestly, I would like Luna to review them tho. I need a lessexperianced coder to read through them so i can know if a novicecan follow my files clearly. If she can not, I will rewrite them.Ironman"
