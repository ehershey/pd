__Letter "Err yeah that subject was supposed to day \"bday idea\" but you know telnet :p.Anyway, i was wondering , how hard would it be to code 20 special roses each with a different personalized message on them? You know, like each one has something like \"20 reasons why I love you\" or something like that, with a differetn reason on each rose. It wouldn't be an event of course, but just a special little gift for me to give to Jon. :) And would it have to go through the admins and if so would that take extra time as well?What do you think? Would it be easy to code? Would it take long to get it done?"
