__Letter "hey :Pi had a bit of a problem herewhen i entered primaldarkness after i typed in my password, i got auto attack by about 3 mobs in a non-exit room, with some kind of a bear getting the final blow :(. when i asked my friend to check that i hadn't gone linkdead, he typed 'last buddylist' to check how i had entered PD. it showed \"Flabber has left PD\" \"Flabber has gone link-dead\"i dont know what just happened there, but i am assuming it was some type of bug because i definately don't recall leaving the town [] or starting any place else. I had logged on earlier that morning and started from the []wait hold on wiz just became unidle talk to u later :P:P"
