__Letter "i haven't been able to check email yet today, but i'm really worried. :( my dad has something else to talk about, and it's about me. :( Err, something else to talk to my mom about that is. Did you send anything in an email that would've been something we didn't want my parents knowing about? Anything that I hadn't told them about? I'm just really worried, cause i have no idea what it's going to be about. But my dad is on his way home now, and should be home within the next 30 minutes. Just...:/ I hope it's nothing too bad :(*love you*PS my dad said he would set email up for me tonight.Heather"
