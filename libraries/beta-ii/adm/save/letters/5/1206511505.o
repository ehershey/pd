__Letter "Hey love, guess what I been doin? :) Darnit, I bet my title gaveme away! I have been missin you. I gotta leave off the g or a ' since I didnt include em in the title. :) Work is going welltonight. I was driving the drunk kids around and some tried toget over on me. They were obviously smuggling a bottle of boozeon my van and I told them we weren't going anywhere til they gotrid of that bottle. So, they got off and dumped it. I am temptedto go back and find it, teehee. :D I got more stuff to write aboutand not enough time for the moment. :) So, I will letcha knowabout more as the situation unfolds. :DTake care, sweet love,James"
