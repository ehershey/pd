__Letter "Ok. I don't blame Yakko for sending that to u. BUT, he's not exactly the person u wanna talk 2 about that. He doesn't even know what the whole conversation was about. See I was talking 2 Druss and was about 2 arena Yakko and yakko told me something, I mistelled that 2 him, and I guess he took it the wrong way. I didn't remember it last night bcuz I was having a party and didn't wanna be rude to my friends so I couldn't really do anything about it. But this morning while eating some Ice cream I remembered what happened.See that day that we were discussing the treaty thing, I took it the wrong way like that you were saying that I couldn't pk anyone in your guild and I would never be able to and that I wasn't strong enough to pk so I needed protection. (I'm 13, very self concious and took it personal. You didn't actually say that, that's just the way it came out to me.) And I got mad and seriously wanted to start a guild war just to prove to u that i could do it. But I told whit and someone else (they both laughed at me, so I gave ^ that idea) but I was still mad cause everyone was making me feel small. There came my conversation with druss inwhich he asked me what was the matter and I told him that. Although I worded it wrong. N*e ways if you care or not I'm sending this to u.Mocha."
