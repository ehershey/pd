__Letter "I found out that my backup of Prator no longer exists, and that was the main reason I kept on coding for PD, so that I could eventually get my character back. Pretty much if it even took 3 months for my cahr to come back, it'd still be faster than trying to exp back up to those stats/skills/levels.So yeah, I lost my 4.5 billion exp character, totally gone, and no one is willing to just recreate the char from scratch, like Stormy did for Rubicante and Ithilgore."
