__Letter "Guys if you need a break and need someone to be a hard-ass to deal with these morons.Let me be the first one to throw my hat into the ring. I'll be the liason between you folks (so you can focus on the coding to keep the mud running) and the immortals.I'd rather donate my free time to aid you guys in your time of need then see the mud suffer. If you wish for me to do it please come talk to me. You should know by now i don't mind helping out.ironman"
