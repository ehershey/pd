__Letter "I think I have said this about too many times, but after Gabriel was pk'd by Ashram, I think it would be good for archangels/demons to have their role-play aspects deepened.I could list my stuff here now, but if you really want to read this then it will prbably end up wasting your time.I'll just say that on builders I have some ideas written down for archangels in (/wizards/aziraphale/ideas). I am going to put some of the stuff I have written in that direcctory now so you can look at it whenever you want.If you want me to do something in particular, then I will. If it is just ideas then they may be a little slow, since I like to play.I'm not so good at demon ideas if you haven't noticed. I *can* come up with them but someone else may be better for it.Since I am writing this I may as well ask: Any decision on the cheap constitution not strength for clerics? I'd like to know what will happen before I spend 45million experience. My impatience got me stuffed as Aziraphale. - Aziraphale 'Prator' Amakiira"
