__Letter "Okay this was the plan Azire and I have come up with for the dragon quest....Hide all the orbs....Hide statues, maybe leave a few in the openThe blue statue is the only one that required all 9 orbs, put into the statue in a pre-determined order...there was going to be a rock with some sort of poem that tells you in a lyrical way...meaning instead of saying red, we would say lava (red) spew forth from the earth (green) etc etc etc etcWe were going to create a green dragon, Many things about this guy, but first... It wasn't going to be mentioned in any way that there will be a fifth dragon.....it was just going to be a fluke kind of a thing....but anywayto become the jade dragon, you had to first find the green orb, find a boy, get the boy to follow you to the green dragon statue, give the orb to the boy, do something like say a phrase, or bow, or something, boy morphs to a dragon, kills you, you become green dragon.....green dragons was going to get earth spells, and transform...just for fun, but the higher you raise stuff, the more stuff you can transform into....or you can get stronger in your weaker form.....need to hammer ideas out for thatthen we were going to surprise the dragons, and re-vamp each dragon, and give them spells/abilites unique to the color...of course we would have to be sneaky about this and get info out of the dragons of what they would like to see, or look at the boards and see what they posted alreadyOh forgot.....no matter what dragon you become (cept green) you always need 9 orbsOrbs can not be taken out of area, they explode when you try to, taking small amounts of hpThe torch was going to be rigged so when turned on, you will be able to find the hidden entrence....an off torch will not trigger the same response.When the torch passes through the entrence, it would be permantely sealed till next reboot, one person pass, we would have to make it so you can't gate/move_player etc once the person is inOkay the eventTo signal an event will be coming, the guard in the square will get very antsy, and keeps looking up in the sky and saying things like, something in the air doesn't feel right....he keeps checking the time etc, (Of course the event would have to take flight just before reboot......we would already have the quest in before the reboot happens so no one would notice something major is upThe event we thought would be something like a swarm of elder dragons causing chaos.....well actally we had several ideas about what would go down, I rather do something different........BUT somehow, we would have to have the even noted in the history of the mud...like a book in the library, and some kind of clue about a light....not sure how to go about that....Well, any or all of this can be changed, I'm not set on anything definate in the above paragraphs, but the one thing I would like to express is the more things they have to do the better, if we can keep it random, good, so even if the idea of how to become a dragon leaks, it's okay, they still have to do a lot of work to become oneI don't want all our work to go to hell in one day because we didn't take all precaution.....hep"
