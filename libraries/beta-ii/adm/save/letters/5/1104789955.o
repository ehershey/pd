__Letter "A couple of things!I am almost done the rules.  As in I'll send them to you more or less completed tonight.  Then you can add the new ones you wanted and I'll work on them too.  I don't know about formatting.  I could make them look cool, but maybe I should leave that for whoever actually inputs them?More importantly, I was talking to Set today, and he was going on about how he was going to be a lich, and then mentioned how he knew vampires were going to have 45 hp/sp/mp per level, and was bragging about how he was on such good terms with the imms that they told him all this stuff.I'm just curious about why he knows so much, and kinda like...  jealous.  Levi"
