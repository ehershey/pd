__Letter "PROBER(Dominant Introvert Concrete Feeler )Greg Like just 3% of the population you are a PROBER (DICF)--curious, passionate, driven, and probing. You're the kind of person who can't leave well enough alone. You have a very strong personality and a sense of adventure. And you'd rather go out and experience things for yourself than take someone else's word for it. Some people probably think you're a maniac. People have a hard time believing you're an intelligent person. Perhaps there's a reason for this? Time will tell. "
