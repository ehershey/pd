__Letter "ok so here is my thoughts on it.  Noone is going to help anyone anymore b/c of this.  For example: I get armour for people all the time b/c they are too small, they dont have money to give me so it is not like i am receiving anything for it, OTHER THAN the lil XP i will get while killing the mobs that have it. So this will make it to where noone will be willing to go kill mobs b/c they are supposedly not in thier XP range.  ANOTHER THING - I dont think you should receive 0 XP for killin these things, b/c that just pushes people to stay at lvl 19 so they dont get the XP cut of 0, which in turns makes it to where noone will lvl to 20 which is ultimately what daboura wants to see more people do. The higher lvl you are the more 0s you get...which throws off that balance.  Lower the XP, yes I can see, but to make it 0 i dont see."
