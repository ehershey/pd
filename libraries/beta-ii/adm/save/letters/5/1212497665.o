__Letter "looks like you're really staying busy here.. keep up the good work man. i read the list of classes to balance out. when you get those done, and before you post another list, any chance i could get you to consider white dragon abilities? or spells? i remember we've talked about this before but we were both at a stand still on ideas for this race/class. hit me back, maybe we can come up with something.i like the 'eat corpse' ability but being a dragon it stuffs you way too quick (in my opinion) but it's hellaciously good for sp regen.. lookin' good man!smokey"
