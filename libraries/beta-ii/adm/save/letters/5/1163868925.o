__Letter "I have made a modified version of /std/room/senses.c that repairsthe problem i found with smell,listen and search.Before they wouldn't call a (: :) properly if they were placed intheir respective \"set_\" functions. The new version calledsenses_ironman.c will call the functions properly :)Please check it out and get back to me if I can start using thesemodifications for builders..... As i stated before, I would ratherteach the builders to use a structure then have to resort to usingadd_action any time they want to call a function for a sound, smellor search.Ironman"
