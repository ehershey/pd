__Letter "Ok guys, encountering a problem and hoping one of you can help. Just bought this crap laptop as a hold me over. It was working great with GMud, smoothly and efficiently but one day I come home from work and the resolution on the computer was all the way down. Got the windows OneCare in right now, everything seems to be working fine on here EXCEPT for GMud. Went and got ZMud, too, hoping it was just GMud being gay, but I'm not having any luck. Everything is choppy, often taking up to 5 seconds to load an entire screen of text. Web pages and what not are working much quicker than a mud, which just ain't right. I'm not very computer savvy, never have been and probably never will be, so I'm hoping one of you guys could throw out some ideas as to what I could do to restore effectiveness to this. I turned the resolution all the way back up and it's still all choppy, help!"
