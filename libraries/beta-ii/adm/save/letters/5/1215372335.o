__Letter "I'm not entirely sure what my intentions are, I don't really have anything in mind. I don't really want to code areas, as I don't have the patience to sit and think of unique room descriptions. My pleasure is more in discovering how to do new and unique things, putting in fun little easter eggs, and discovering and fixing bugs.I don't really need tutorials, I still remember most of the basic commands and I usually learn how to do something that I don't know how to do by checking out code others have worked on. I suppose I could give it a good look over though.Where is the construction board? I tried making a character on builders but \"pick race\" doesn't work, so I'm just stuck at the character creation room.Is the builders area usually so barren? When I checked it out there was nobody online, that's kind of a deperessing coding environment."
