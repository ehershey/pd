__Letter "Could you add the following to user.c for me?string get_instance_group_id() { return query_name() }and then a set_death() function like the one in monster.c, so that I can make a ring that heals the player when they are about to die and then destroys itself. That ring was going to be my reward for the ogre king event, the current prototype is at DRAG_ITEMS\"pheonixring.c\" if you want to look at it."
