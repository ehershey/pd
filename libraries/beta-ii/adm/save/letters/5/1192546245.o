__Letter "I replied back to her mail, after she tried to call me about this stuff..which no thank you.  But this is what was said.You've not been more active than Piehl.  Yes, you've been on a couple times in the past week, but you were on Furiae for a second, then switched to an alt.  I do not understand why you're so upset about losing Illuminati.  As far as the payment thing goes, I bought the guild in the auction, but the money you put into the guild is a possibility.  She is not active and knows it, you've been on have you even seen her?  I do not understand why she's acting like this is all of a sudden.Orcha is also mad of course, but he was given 15 days to post his activity, and he posted it on an alt in DS, but not one person posted in Forsaken, so I dont see why he's mad either."
