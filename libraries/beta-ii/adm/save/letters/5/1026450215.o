__Letter "I know I know, youve heard it all before. This is an actual request from a bunch of the Darksoulers. They want to know if Aziraphale can be removed from the darksoul line like you guys do with me and the hma and admin lines.Even though I am a little biased in this one, I personally dont want him to have that line. Let me know what you think about it."
