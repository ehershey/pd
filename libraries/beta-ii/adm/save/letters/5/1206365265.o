__Letter "Hi love. :) Ho did you expect me ta start this message, hmm? :) Iwas up all night watching movies and such and then I got on youtube.I got curious about something and saw this video about fibromyalgia.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSacbApgVW8I started looking into it. At the end of video, this guy gives alink to: http://www.healthynutrition.comThen the pdf there about fibromyalgia gives a link to another place:http://www.phoenixnutritionals.comThe stuff there they recommend for fibromyalgia sounds a lil on theexpensive side, but I didnt know if you'd be interested.I hope you dont see me as some kind of buttinsky or something. Ijust want you to be feeling better. Well, I will take foot out ofmouth now. :) I feel like I wrote you an infomercial. :( My next letter will be much better, promise. :)Love you,James"
