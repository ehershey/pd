__Letter "Hi ns :P.Sorry to annoy you with this, but venenum refered me to you as he can't help me.Venenum coded an update for my \"Ethereal Wings\" custom item which allowed me to add names to them for people to see and so on, and was suposed to save the names over re-boot. Now the names do get saved, however the description for some reason, resets itself over re-boot or when i quit out. This isn't a really big problem now, but could get annoying later on. Venenum is stumped and says 'it worked fine on builders i don't know why it isn't working here' and then told me that i should contact you about it. I realise that you probably have far more important things happening at the moment and i won't be fussed if it dosn't get fixed immiadiately (sp?). If there is anyway that i can help please let me know :).     - Tsuke."
