__Letter "I have written a new command to make it easy to locate allcopies of a given file within the entire system.THe file is stored in /cmds/IRONMAN right now and is called_findfile.c%^RED%^%^BOLD%^SYNTAX%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^findfile%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^ <Filename goes here>%^RESET%^I feel this kinda location tool is a tad to powerful to allow ANYONE tohave so please insert it into /cmds/adm so only the Archwizards may useit. I will however understand if you wish the builders to have access tothis tool.Im not sure how to set up the euids yet but if you can have the commandcheck to see if the person has ACCESS to the files BEFORE they are listedthen i think this tool would be great for the builders to have :)I'll leave it up to you if you wish to have only archwizards have use ofit. Or if you wish to adapt the command so it will check for the person's access to the files before they are listed :)Ironman, The absent-minded Professor"
