__Letter "This is me just putting my hand up for a possible imm position that was mentioned on the board.I've been around for PD in sorts pretty much since the beginnig of PD-2 and new about it even before then.I don't really have the time, but mainly not the interest to play anymore. Due to numerous factors but mainly university takes too much of my time. I'm doing software engineering btw so i am decent at coding. I've done some minor building on here and merentha so i am somewhat familiar with LPC but never completed an area.I don't think anyone else would really suggest me, unless i ask them to though because i am out of touch with the newer players. I think this is also a plus however because i would not be biased towards anyone.I think i am pretty fair and would be a good candidate if Pd is to continue. Yeap thats pretty much it.Thanks~tyste"
