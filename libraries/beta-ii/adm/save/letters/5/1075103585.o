__Letter "Azira/Ama here. I had an accident on the mud which broke the rules.I've been exping in Roston caverns with Sasayaki lately. I found that I could trigger movement so that I wouldn't have to hunt for new dragons myself. Then I found that I could get it to automatically attack them if they were in the room. Well, things kind of snowballed and I set it up to fight for me while I talked to my friends.Anyway, today I was exping and talking with a friend when my parents got home and said I had to *immediately* help them unload the groceries. I quickly interrupted the triggers and went and did that, then I was running late for work. Problem was that I had stopped the triggers from going but I was in a rush and didn't disable the whole thing, so when my internet reconnected later it all started up again.I got home a few hours later and started looking back at the logs trying to figure why I was so spammed when I got disconned. I figured it was the net but no it was still going. I came on and no Aziraphale. Apparently while I was looking over the logs trying to see what was happening, Nightshade had already dested my character. :( I wish I had just gone with my first impluse and said \"What the fcuk\" over elite, hehe. I suppose I could've explained it if I hadn't already been removed.*sighs* It's too bad, I had gone to the fridge to get some food before coming over. If I hadn't done that I could've told NS about the mistake before anything really bad happened. His main beef with keeping me off is he can't tell that I hadn't done it before, which is fair enough. All I can think of to say in regards to that is that Sasayaki knows when I was on and exping with it because we pretty much only ever did it at the same time.Hahahaha, and on a second point: If I wanted to cheat wouldn't I have just spawned a few hundred drow generals, set them to 1 hp and have Az kill them all? It's far less risky then leaving a script going for hours on end. I've had months to cheat my character up with Imm powers, but I never have.I'd hate to lose another char just becuase I mussed up."
