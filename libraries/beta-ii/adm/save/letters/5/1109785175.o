__Letter "Flick isn't an area attack like Firebomb either.As I've said before, and I'll repeat here in excruciating detail to make sure that you understand, unless you do comparisons to other spells and give us numbers, we will NOT look into Firebomb anymore than we already have.For example: It takes X rounds with Firebomb but only Y rounds with <insert other area attack here> to kill mob Z with the same stats, level, and skills. Or Firebomb, over X number of casts, averaged Y damage to player Z in the arena, whereas <insert other area attack here> averaged W damage to player Z in the same number of casts."
