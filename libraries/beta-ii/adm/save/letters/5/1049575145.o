__Letter "I don't know if it would be possible to do this, but could you code something that lets us edit rooms like typing something \"instead of line 10 put (insert code here)\" and it would erase that line and put your replacement in?  It's not really important but it'd make some jobs, like going back and fixing areas, easier."
