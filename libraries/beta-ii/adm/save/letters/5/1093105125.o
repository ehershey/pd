__Letter "while you were an imm here, you had access to privilidged information such as exact stat costs, what skills and stats were used for spells, and so on.  I'm really wondering why I dont rid you right now for taking that information and posting it on a public board.  I mean really.  It's hard enough to keep people from tweaking out their characters and taking advantage of any slight misbalance.  and dont tell me it \"should already be balanced\" cause I've wasted enough of my life working on keeping things balanced here.  I'll decide whether you can keep your char within the next few days.                         -Nightshade"
