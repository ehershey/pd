__Letter "kk, here's an ideal song that can buffer up someone's melee. Dunno a good name for it, but got some lyrics down. (Part 1) This is a song for those whom are strong (Part 2) May your melee never fail you for all night long (Part 3) Not sure if there will be a part three, but if so let me know and I'll make up some more lyrics."
