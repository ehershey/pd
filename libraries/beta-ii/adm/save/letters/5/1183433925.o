__Letter "I thought of this and wanted to see what you thought of it.Capture the FlagWhat it would do is pin guild against guild (they would have to sign up for the game), and we could use no attack rooms so no PK goes on, and use the paintball game as a part of it. Make a big area to where they have to run around and find the flag and get it back to their base W/O being tagged by the paintballs.The guild that wins, moves on if there are enough guilds playing; and if you lose you're out.The overall winner will recieve some sort of prize, wheather it be money, an item, or whatever is decided.***This game could also be a non guild game where we can pick teams or draw colors.let me know what you think :)Carina"
