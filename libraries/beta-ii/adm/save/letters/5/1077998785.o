__Letter "I don't even know where to begin actually, and I don't even know if i could really explain it in a mudmail. Just when I thought Jon and I were getting things worked out and getting better, i get his email reply and it gets even worse. :(  There's just so many things going on, and I'm just so miserable. :'( :'( :'( The main thing that's got me really upset...he wrote back and said that he doesn't do a lot of things because to him it seems like they are just \"wants\" not \"needs\". But damnit I need my wants fulfilled too! And it really makes me extremely sad that he only wants to take care of my needs. :( :'(  I've meailed him back and told him this, and told him hw I felt. :'(But he doesn't want to talk about it over voice chat. In fact he just wants to forget about it: he always can until \"I\" start bringing it all up again. That's the point, I don't bring it up again, it comes up again, which means we have never solved anything, and I'm just so damn sick of being completely miserable because of this problem. I want ot get it solved and over with, so that it doesn't come up again.Though, I think in a way it's better that we're emailing this instead of talking about it, because he doesn't seem to say everything he wants to when we're talking. So at least this way I get to hear everything about how he's feeling. That's a little something that bothers me as well, that he sometimes doesn't say how he feels because he's afriad of how it will affect me. I want him to be able to say anything, regardless of how it might affect me. He is, at least, though it's only through emails. :(That's really just a big summary of everything, but so much stuff is going on. \"'(Heather"
