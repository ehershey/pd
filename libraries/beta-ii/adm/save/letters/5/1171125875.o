__Letter "I have totally rewired the security system on builders.Please see \"help workrooms\" when you come on again. Each one of the functions have their own man file as well.The system is controlled by the following two files;/std/room/wizard_room.c/adm/simul_efun/security_screen.cThe BuildSecure.c file doesn't do much of anything now.I have patched the master.c so that it will check access.db ;BuildSecure.c and security_screen.cPlease use the master()-valid_read() and master()->valid_write()tests for read and write access for files on builders. If you wishto limit a person's ability to pull info off of an object, Pleaseuse the Sfun called security_screen_scan(). If you wish to limit,the movement of people on the port, Use the sfun builder_move_test()for this task.I have also coded several new commands on the builders port. Theyare as follows;summary      objcmds       functions       groupsIn addition, The _localcmds.c now works.Feel free to monkey with any of the commands I coded. Especiallythe _summary.c command. This command is designed to handle most ofthe information codable by the mudlib. I'm sure i have left things out tho and really need a decent coder to read over the command to help me cleanit up.Last issue. There is now a constructions board here on the main site.It is located at neenuw from tirun [].Ironman"
