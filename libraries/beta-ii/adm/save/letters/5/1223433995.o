__Letter "So I find myself growing more and more tired with Cenn's actions. Him actually refusing to xp by himself the other night while I was trying to gage out Geddoe got me pk'd. He is all around lazy. And does nothing by himself.I think I may be leaving vorticon for a posistion at unholy.All of this is still up in the airbut I really find my self frustrated when i see cenn.I dunnoAnyways hope you're having a good night at work."
