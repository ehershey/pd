__Letter "If you wish to talk to me after you're a little less... tipsy.  You can.  But I'm telling you I'm apt to ignore you if you annoy me, again.  Personally, I find this whole thing ludicrous.  Oh boy, Ryan touched your girlfriend.  It's not like he raped her.  She got over it, everyone else got over it, yet you are simmering against it.  It's time to move on with life, you have fullfilled your requirements of being a good boyfriend by honoring her and thus can guarntee her love.  Can we get on with life, now?  "
