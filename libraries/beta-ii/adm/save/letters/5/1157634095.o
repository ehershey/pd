__Letter "I know you're not working on monks right now, but maybe you could save this mail for reference when you do get to them..was thinkin for supplication, it's pretty useless right now without the stacking, and the stacking never really was a big deal..so maybe you could alter it to where you sacrifice dex for str or con for dex etc etc and you can exchange up to 10 stats for every ten lvls you arethis alongside a slightly higher boost in skills including melee"
