__Letter "Hi Dab, without the portal in the Illum hall and tirun, Illuminati members have no way of getting into or out of the guild hall, the only way we can get in is to use a guild seal and to get out we gotta use a wax marked to wherever, could we please have our portal back so that we at least just have accsess to our guild hall?Thanks Paranoia"
