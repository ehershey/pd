__Letter "I've missed you, hun.  I just wanted to send you a quick mail and let you know how I was doing.  I'm going to an interview in about an hour or so for a job up here.  Afterwards, I'm going home for the weekend.  I havent been able to get to my mail much, either...  I'm trying to earn my keep, so I've been busy refinishing this old cupboard for my uncle and cleaning out the garage.  But anyway, I just wanted to say hi and give ya a hug.  *HUGS*             -Paul"
