The walls seem to glow multiple shades of black and redsimultaneously, and are accompanied by the otherworldly light of a largeintense black fire in the center of the room.Look fire-The fire is surrounded by acircle of glowing arcane runes, and emits a swirling, almost living azhure smoke.syntax: scry <name>And we would like the portal put undeneath the training room.Tirun portal room- The room you have entered seems to drop away from realityas you enter. Surrounding you, a tunnel of black fire twists and swirls, forming and dissipating as it whirls around you. The fire seems to be drawn towards the centre of the room, where it changes from black chaos to the huge form of a fanged wolf skull. The fiery skull rages as it opens wide, a deep red glow shows forth from inside.Portal - This is the transport portal of the Forsaken. It is used totravel great distances by means of incredible magics accesible by only that of the Forsaken. The portal's flames leap and dance inside the great circle, forming mysterious shapes and pictures of faraway lands.Descriptions for the Helgrath stuff.helgrath hall-You have entered Forsaken's secret hall of Helgrath. Thedetailed designs and pictures of exotic looking demihumans and extra-planar beings are etched all along the walls. They seem to glow as you walk past them and they spurt forth the piercing blue coldfire from their eyes. The fire gathers in the middle of the room, swirling and dancing as it forms an enormous clawed hand, which reaches towards the ceiling.Helgrath portal room- This room is dominated by hundreds of twisted silver vines. A scraggly vine-formed path leads to the center of the room, where they twist together and form a large round circle standing upright. At the point of the circle the vines disperse an intense golden fire, which leaps from them into the centre of the circle. The circle pulsates with a certain power.Portal descriptions both the same thanksany probs, just tell me or mail me.Once again thanks :D"
