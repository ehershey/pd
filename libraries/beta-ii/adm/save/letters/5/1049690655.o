__Letter "Hey Jake.Well, I'd like to pretend that I'm not worried but I really am.  A couple of weeks ago, for the first time since I was a child, I was in tears in the shower at the thought of you being dead or something.  I'm telling myself, though, that you're not going to die, because you have some crazy powers for sure.School has been brutal lately...  I feel like I'm at the end and it wont ever get any better, or really change at all.  Almost everything is going ok but it's not enough for me.  I want it all.  Right now!I want to see lots of pictures from where you've been, especially of that jungle training, when you get back...  and anyway, if I don't hear from you in another month I'll call your house and see if you're ok...Levi"
