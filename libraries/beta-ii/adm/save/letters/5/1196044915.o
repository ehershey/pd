__Letter "In case you don't get on and reboot happens, here's a mud mail for you.my brother said i don't really need to get a new phone line, Ican just get an extension, so that will make it a lot easier.  Especially, ifI'm not staying at his place indefinitely.  At least I can use the internet. He also said there was no sense in getting a new internet hookup.Basically it's the same as what I said in the honey line.  I will returnshortly.  :)"
