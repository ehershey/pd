__Letter "Ok I caught you up at level 5. Also, I have found that I am able to fight the 10k monsters in Arlon. You should be able to as well, just gotta use oil once you get to 150hp, and leave the room if you get below 100.So anyway, the next we are both ready to exp we should get good fighting down there.[ break ]I'm really sorry I stopped it earlier today. I should've checked the time before getting into it. Heh, at the time I was lying down on the futon in front of the screen, so you can imagine how easy it would have been for me to surrender to dreaming there.I feel kinda insensitive over it... Any way I can make it up? ;)Hmm, that is all that I can think of for the moment.I cannot wait to see you princess.   Jon"
