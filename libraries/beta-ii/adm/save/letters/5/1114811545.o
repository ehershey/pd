__Letter "My Plea    This was my frist time doing anything like this and I know it was wrong,which is why i put the money back right where i got it from; I did not use it,not even one bit.  This is also the reason I am turning myself in.  I know youwill see what happened, and I feel it is better to confess rather than just letyou guys come to me.  I am a big player on this mud and I love it; I amprobably one of the most active players you have.  I accept the consequences to come; but I ask that you please go easy on me,seeing how this is my first time and I put everything back without using it.  Ido not wish to be deleted from the game; however, I know that this is anoption.  I do my best to what is right, and I feel this letter is the rightthing to do.  I apologize for even doing it in the first place, which is why I did, and am,righting my wrong.  Thank you.Goldenberry"
