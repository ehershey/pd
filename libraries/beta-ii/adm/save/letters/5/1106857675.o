__Letter "The rocks on the forest floor are covered in mould and slime, a few largeboulders are also scattered around.  The trees are huge, and provide enoughshade to keep you cool despite the heat of day.  Stones litter the ground, manyof them are covered in a green moss that is very slick.  Small shrubs andplants grow out across the path, making it difficult to follow.  Tia What? Oh yeah... Tia = WhackMind of Asmodeus Set - Death Magick Adept"
