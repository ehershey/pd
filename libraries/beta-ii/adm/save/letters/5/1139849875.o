__Letter "Hey Beautiful, how are you doing? I\"m doing pretty good, today seems like it's going to be a good day because school got cancled for me because there was snow on the roads :P. The funny thing is, is that all the snow is melted already and when I took the dogs out about 5-10 mins ago it seems like it had be melted for a couple of hours lol. I miss you so much and I can't wait to talk to you tonight, reguardless if it's on this game or on the phone(hopefully the phone though!). I thought about you all night and my mind is thinking about you so much now it's not funny. I love you so much Simran!With much Love,Josh"
