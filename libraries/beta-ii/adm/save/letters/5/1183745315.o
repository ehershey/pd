__Letter "Daboura-	I was thinking about something.  I know the Immortal position is between Ironman and myself, and I was trying to see what it is that we both could offer.  Ironman is better at actual code, where as I feel as if in the building department I am better, and I take direction better as well.  I think I have good ideas, and that Ironman could help bring them together.  What would you think about him and me working together, both as Event Immortals.  The reason I thought of this is because we can both offer good things, and if we work together we can get more going.  Plus, I know that when the fall comes both him, and I, will be busy.  Personally, I'll be in 9 classes for school and working, and I know that Ironman works as well.  If we worked together this would not be a problem, but if we cannot work together, then I am not sure if you would want to hire me over Ironman at this time.	I wanted to be honest with you.  I would LOVE to be an Immortal and help, and bring my ideas into the game and I would LOVE to make new areas while working as an Imm as well.  But my main concern is when the fall hits with my schedule.  Please let me know what you think about this idea.  And if you hate it, then it might be better if you hire Ironman over me, because if I'm working alone when the fall hits, I will not be able to get everything done.  I know this will probably hinder my chances of being an immortal, but school does have to come first; especially when I'm so close to graduating.  I can always apply later if you decide to only want one person.	I feel like I would do a good job and that my ideas and my past working with you and the other imms shows that I would be a good Immortal, and I want to be one and do the events.  I would just feel more comfortable in the Fall if I was working with someone.  Please think about it, and let me know what you decide.  Thank you,Carina/Samantha"
