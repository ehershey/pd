description "has huge green eyes that peer out, inquisitively from behind long eyelashes, two massive horns jutting forth from the top of her head. Engraved, yet neatly inscribed and inked in green into her left horn is \"Gob's\" large enough for anyone to see from a reasonable distance, not that she could be missed anyway. Red bony eye ridges angle elegantly down to her maw, sharpening to a sort of beak, a large nostril on each side. Pierced through her nostrils are two large golden rings. Her lips, well they are non existent, a slight colour change around her mouth but the teeth she tries to hide inside are -huge-, white and glistening, she has obviously flossed after a good feed of elf. She spots you looking at her and whispers to you \"Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, as you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup\". She wears a ring from a special friend and even though they can no longer roam the lands together, they will be together in spirit, never to be parted."
