description "is sleek and graceful. His fur is fastidiously combed and shines healthily. Fiercely loyal to his friends, Gonzales will happily draw blade to any who transgress upon them or himself. His swords, always sheathed at his sides, are worn, and unlike everything else about him - look used. His movements and attitude suggest he is swift and skilled with these weapons and the confident air about him shows that he is not one who will easily be pushed around."
