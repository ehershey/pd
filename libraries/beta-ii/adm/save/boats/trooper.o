long_desc "You are aboard Poseidon's  Trident, the fastest boat of the sea. Captain Trooper aquired the ship in a drunken poker match, in which he managed to cheat a lowly pirate and win a fortune along with the ship. The Trident is a humongous vessel, with large, black sails extended at full. Atop of the crows nest flies the flag of the Blacksails, with a bastet skull and its two crossbones."
