angel_statue
needs a set_weight, maybe 50-75ish
set_name should be lowercased
set_id should not include angel

angelskin_backpack
long: "was made the Angels in the Temple"
curr_value too low
should inherit PACK;
remove the void init() { } function completely
in create() remove armour::create() and change take bag_logic off the next line
  so it's just ::create() like normal
is this made -from- the angels in the temple?? by fallen angels??
  it doesn't make sense for angels to make packs out of other angels

has id of "monk statue"
long: "Mulitple"->"Multiple", "tigers back"->"tiger's back",
  "cirlces it's"->"circles its"

bench
needs set_weight
heals too much for too little cost (5 seconds para == 2, maybe 3 rounds)
  more like add_hp(200+random(300)); add_sp(100+random(200)); add_mp(100+random(200));
  and set_paralyzed(8);

in drinking function: "Your cannot"->"You cannot"
above this_player()->set_disable() add this:
  if (!this_player()->add_quenched(15)) {
    write("You are too full to drink right now.");
    return 1;
  }
in finding function: "as if locates"->"as it locates"
