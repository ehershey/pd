black_pants
ac of 1 for level 30+ eq??
in the auto load function you must return something, try making it like this:
int query_auto_load() {
  return this_player()->query_level() >= 30;
}
that should work as intended

black_shirt
long: "they are light yet tough"
ac should be higher, probably just 2

brown_robes
long desc is a run-on sentence
curr_value too high

monk_robes
long: "If offers"->"It offers",
  "wearers"->"wearer's", "alligence"->"allegiance"

paw_warmers
covers hands and feet, but are boots...
just make a glove version for the hands (left+right paw)

pygmy_cap
long: "...created by the Pygmies the sky."
curr_value too high

rope_belt
almost all of the armours say "it offers little protection", this is bad

white_collar
should cover head (neck == head)

white_robes
these are almost exactly the same as the monk robes, this is bad
