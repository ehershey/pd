boomerang
WC is very low
set_type() in there twice
long: "not only used for a weapon" ?? what else is it for??
don't set("skill level"), this is automatically computed from the WC
same auto_load problem as armours, see note on first armour
set_name should be all lowercase

ivory_scepter
don't put adjectives by themselves in set_id, you can "look ivory"
  and this is not made of ivory
WC is very low

mahogany_staff
long: "it was foraged"->"forged"
same problems as the other weapons

ribbed_bow
same problems as all the other weapons
