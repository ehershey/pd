Carina replies: ~~* ok idea 1:  I think we should change the law system a
little bit.  I think that after a certain ammount of time your murder charges
and lil charges go away.  Kindof like in real life, after awhile the charges no
longer show up.  So say I get a charge today, in 2 mud years or so that charge
is taken off, and say i get one next week, in 2 mud years from then that charge
is taken off.  Obviously the time is under descresion, just an idea. *~~

Carina replies: ~~* idea 2:  community boats.  Much like the way the coaches
are, only it is a boat.  Now this would mean the boat system would need to be
changed to what the coaches are like aka "sail to merk" or "sail to rhondale"
and make the elapsed time the same as if you were sailing on your own, aka
"sail south" "sail south" etc etc *~~
Carina replies: ~~* idea 3:  Have sky ships, that would work like regular ships
only they can take you to areas in the sky, and then i know i am making an
entire elite town for the sky. *~~
