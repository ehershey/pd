Majere <mature> rather be wrapped around someones finger.... than a fathers
dick
This was posted after abraxas and Morgana had an argument in which morgana kept saying Abra was crying to daddy to get things changed:

Abraxas <newbie> you could always just go straight to the alchoholic energy
drinks
Morgana <newbie> monster. is. fail.
Morgana <newbie> since she said she doesnt drink
Morgana <mature> dumb ass
Abraxas <newbie> with stupid amounts of alchohol
<newbie> Sugarcandy does -not- drink
Vian <newbie> i need cool ideas
Sugarcandy <newbie> my days of drunk mudding are over :P
Morgana <mature> yeah the energy drinks that get virgin nerds drunk in one can,
i hear
Abraxas <newbie> wasn't talking directly to sugarcandy, dumbass
Sugarcandy <newbie> oooo! abra cussed on newbie!
Majere <mature> lol
Abraxas <newbie> nope
Morgana <newbie> its okay, hes abraxas
Abraxas <newbie> i can say ass all i want
Vian <newbie> before they changed them, i drank 3.5 four lokos and 2 double
vodka cokes one night
Vian <newbie> it took me 2 hours to get home
Vian <newbie> when it usually takes 15 minutes
Sugarcandy <newbie> lol vian.. that's not healthy
Abraxas <newbie> morgana is an ass, morgana takes it up the ass, ass ass ass
Morgana <mature> alcoholic energy drinks have 12% or less alcohol in them
Sugarcandy <newbie> abra... pls stop
Vian <newbie> abraxas, that isn't appropriate conversation for the newbie line
<newbie> Majere agrees
Majere <mature> depends on the state
Majere <mature> Most are 6% or less
Abraxas <mature> 12% is far more than your average beer
Vian <mature> in arizona they're 12%
Morgana <mature> same as in steel reserve
Majere <mature> I believe in oklahoma is 3%
Morgana <mature> or any gravity brewed beer
Morgana <mature> yeah its 3 in OK
Sugarcandy <newbie> and vian... beware.. i'm coming back to builders LOL
Morgana <mature> ps
Morgana <mature> http://i51.tinypic.com/2zdonye.jpg
Vian <newbie> you can keep sopboo company there
Abraxas <mature> gotta sit somewhere while I'm out having a job and a life
Sugarcandy <newbie> oh goodness
Abraxas <mature> but you wouldn't know anything about that
Morgana <mature> yeah because you know me oh so well, haha.
Sugarcandy <mature> abra... i've often found that people who feel the need to
assert something on a regular basis are often times lying about that which they
assert
<mature> Morgana nods at Sugarcandy.
Sugarcandy <mature> just an observation
Abraxas <mature> lol...so morgana starts shit and you suck his dick?
Sugarcandy <newbie> vian.. this could all be avoided if you'd just code me some
faeries
Sugarcandy <mature> nope... i'm just making a point
Vian <newbie> but think about it
Vian <newbie> if i code an area ANd you code an area
Vian <newbie> thats 2 areas
Vian <newbie> instead of 1
Majere <newbie> true true
Sugarcandy <newbie> yeah.. but if you code the area then i don't have to code
the area.. and that'd still be only 1
Vian <newbie> stormy has me inspired for a tiny area with a big event right now
Vian <newbie> which i think i'll be working on
Sugarcandy <mature> you're a very rude young man... has anyone ever told you
that?
Abraxas <mature> so, I defend myself, and I'm the rude one?
Sugarcandy <newbie> lol ok... i'll code my own danged faeries
Morgana <mature> No, you're rude because youre a spoiled little dick.
Abraxas <mature> you're a very presumptious young lady, yo uknow that?
Morgana <mature> Your way or you cry and whine.
Sugarcandy <mature> well you did just reference me sucking someone's dick...
that wasn't very polite don't you think?
Abraxas <mature> lol, spoiled
Abraxas <mature> if I was anthing liek the kind of person you say I am morgana,
you wouldn't be here
Abraxas <mature> pointing out the obvious is rude, then so be it
Morgana <mature> youre here because you have no real life
Morgana <mature> and it makes you feel big to talk shit on the internet
Abraxas <mature> LOL coming from you, that's hilarious
<mature> Morgana points out numerous people who knows him irl.
Abraxas <mature> you are the only one who ever starts this
Vian <mature> thats it
Vian <mature> time for me to spam ya'll
Vian <mature> sec
Majere <mature> Thats it, i've had it, i hate to be dramatic, but its time for
me to fly the coup

Vian stops singing!
Vian <newbie> OMG i need to keep singing
Vian <mature> ------- the best part is
Vian <mature> ------- 1) theres no moar arguing
Vian <mature> ------- 2) i'm singing out loud while typing
Sugarcandy <newbie> ouch
Vian <newbie> if me singing means you make an area
Vian <newbie> i'd say its a win/win
Vian <mature> ------- sugar can we sing together this time
Vian <mature> ------- both play it at the same time

Majere <mature> You need to sing
Majere <mature> Cry me a river Vian
Morgana <mature> dont be. hes a mindless fool
Vian <mature> ------- maybe hes right
Sugarcandy <mature> think i can get stormy to go stomp on his toes?
Vian <mature> ------- maybe there is something the matter with me
Vian <mature> ------- I just dont see how a world that makes such wonderful
things
Vian <mature> ------- coudl be bad
Abraxas <mature> well don't be a bitch to me, I won't return the favor
Vian <mature> ------- look at this stuff isnt it neatmature wouldnt you think

Vian <mature> ------- wouldnt you think i'm the girl
Vian <mature> ------- the girl who has everything

Sugarcandy <mature> i'm not being a bitch.. i can be if you'd like that better
Morgana <mature> just fact.
Login <system> Inbound connection from IP: 174.0.214.144
Morgana <mature> you know
Vian <mature> ------- I've got gadgits and gizmos ap[lenty
Login <system> Lilka from 174.0.214.144
Vian <mature> ------- I've got whosits and whatsits galore
Morgana <mature> if it was sopboo acting like abraxas on public lines
Abraxas <mature> your comment was pretty bitchy
Morgana <mature> he'd be killed
Vian <mature> ------- you want thingamabobs?  MINES 20" LONG
Vian <mature> ------- but who cares? no big deal.  i wan moooooore
Sugarcandy <mature> that is true
Morgana <mature> or worse.
Sopboo <mature> most likely
Morgana <mature> but lil kris gets his way, every time
<mature> Majere isn't surprised
Morgana <mature> like i said, talk mad shit, cry to daddy, sit in forsaken
<Acolytes> Sopboo <unholy> what i miss
Sugarcandy <mature> if any of us sad what abra says or talked shit like that
you wouldn't be very happy with us
Morgana <mature> no one would be
Vian <mature> ------- I told him not to use that language on the lines
Morgana <mature> multiple times
Vian <mature> ------- and Sopboo was killed because of what he said about
Nulvect
Morgana <mature> has he been told that
Morgana <mature> at least he said it on mature
Sopboo <mature> i'd kick him in the nuts?
Vian <mature> ------- yaman
Abraxas <mature> didn't say anything else on the newbie line, did I?
Sugarcandy <mature> well.. sop was in the wrong and was punished
Morgana <mature> just the taking it in the ass part, ass ass ass
Majere <mature> You said ass, like 10 times
Majere <mature> and said... you can if you want
Vian <mature> ------- I mean, I've been told about harass logs plenty of times
Morgana <mature> hes been told multiple times, on multiple occassions on
multiple days
Vian <mature> ------- but I don't know how to read them
Abraxas <mature> way to not read what I said majere
Vian <mature> ------- so :P
Sugarcandy <mature> yeah.. i got gagged for saying "pissed"
Abraxas <mature> well pissed is censored
Abraxas <mature> ass isn't
Vian <mature> ------- Sugarcandy, I just like putting things in your mouth
Morgana <mature> cunt isnt sensored either
Vian <newbie> @!@@
Morgana <mature> neither is twat
Vian <mature> ------- yes it is
Vian <mature> ------- brb gagging myself
Sugarcandy <mature> lol vian.. you're not helping my "sugar doesn't suck dick"
case :P
Sopboo <mature> good
Vian <mature> ------- only for 1 minute though cause i like to talk
Lilka <mature> what is going on....
Sopboo <mature> you don't suck dick??
Abraxas <mature> fuck if I know
Sopboo <mature> wtf kind of women are you
<mature> Lilka can into this at the wrong time
Sugarcandy <mature> abra is being an entitled, pompous ass
Morgana <mature> twat isnt censored
Abraxas <mature> and you aren't?
Sopboo <mature> fuck shit balls cunt
Lilka <mature> hmmm
Sugarcandy <mature> not really.. i'm being an instigative little shit most
likely
Abraxas <mature> if people don't want to have conversations liek this then they
shouldn't start it
Sopboo <mature> stfu everyone i'll start stabbing
Morgana <mature> there is no conversations with you, haha
Vian <mature> ------- omg longest gag ever
Morgana <mature> theres an arugment, you start personal attacks
Vian <mature> ------- okay guys
Sugarcandy <mature> much different from an entitled, pompous ass
Morgana <mature> they return the personal attacks on you
Vian <mature> ------- I'm going to give Levi a phone call
Morgana <mature> and you cry to daddy
Vian <mature> ------- which costs me a lot of money
Abraxas <mature> hardly
Vian <mature> ------- cause its international
Vian <mature> ------- and I'm gonna have him come back
Vian <mature> ------- so we can have good old school law again
Vian <mature> ------- sound good?
Morgana <mature> haha, you call me a low life, etc basement dweller
Sopboo <mature> yes
Sugarcandy <mature> lol awesome
Abraxas <mature> ?
Abraxas <mature> with levi?
Morgana <mature> same insults you use on rohl
Abraxas <mature> you mean wraith?
Sugarcandy <mature> do it vian
Vian <mature> ------- because then we'll all just get dested
Autosaving.
Morgana <mature> real original, you virgin ass loser
Sopboo <mature> rofl true
Majere <mature> Player wipe ftw
Abraxas <mature> I don't remember levi doing anything extreme
Sopboo <mature> everyone calm down and let me read the backlog
Sopboo <mature> so then i cna get mad
Sugarcandy <mature> lol this is so much better than working
Vian <mature> ------- levi had me gagged more often than I was ungagged
Vian <mature> ------- but he was also in love with me
Abraxas <mature> aside from azire handing out gags like they were candy, wraith
was the worst
<mature> Sugarcandy smacks Sopboo over the head... new leaf remember?
Morgana <mature> worst because they didnt put up with your shit?
Sugarcandy <mature> i always liked wraith
Sopboo <mature> i just fuckin shined my shoes
Sopboo <mature> so im already in a bad mood
Morgana <mature> everyone else in power puts up with your childish bullshit
because of who you are
<Acolytes> Sopboo <unholy> wtf happened sugar
<Acolytes> Sopboo <unholy> tell me!!
Vian <mature> ------- I don't put up with bullshit
<Acolytes> Sopboo <unholy> im waiting for burgers so i can brush me teeth and
go get drunk
Morgana <mature> you put up with his
Morgana <mature> who won the dragon event again vian?
Morgana <mature> was it geddoe?
<unholy> Sugarcandy <Pravus> morgana said something... abra said something
about having a life... i said something along the lines of the lady doth
protest too much
Morgana <mature> didnt think so
Morgana <mature> yet, here sits abraxas
<unholy> Sugarcandy <Pravus> and then he said that morgana starts shit and i
suck his dick or something like that
Vian <mature> ------- I had Geddoe arrested for 4 weeks
<unholy> Sugarcandy <Pravus> and here we are
Abraxas <mature> ???
Morgana <mature> i heard he bitched and cried
Abraxas <mature> when did this happen?
Morgana <mature> because star beat him to it
Vian <mature> ------- october a couple years ago
Morgana <mature> but yet, like i said, here sits abraxas
Vian <mature> ------- for PKing my husband's alt after my husband looted him
Abraxas <mature> don't think you are remembering correctly
Vian <mature> ------- I think I am.
Morgana <mature> here he goes again
Morgana <mature> mr know it all
Abraxas <mature> the only person geddoe has ever pked was cowl, and he was only
arrested for 2 weeks for it
Morgana <mature> pull the dick out yo ears abraxas and listen
Sopboo <mature> let me have gag power muhaha
Vian <mature> ------- Freddie looted Geddoe, and Geddoe PKed Dalamar after it,
and was arrested for 4 weeks.
Abraxas <mature> hrmm it definitely wasn't 4 weeks
Majere <mature> Get dealt
Vian <mature> ------- Yes it was :P
Sopboo <mature> vian prolly lookin at the logs lol
Morgana <mature> he knows it all vian
Abraxas <mature> well then it was lifted early
Morgana <mature> no need to argue
Morgana <mature> IMAGINE THAT
Morgana <mature> of ocurse if was lifted early
Morgana <mature> thats where "cry to daddy" coemes in
Abraxas <mature> but dalamar was demon, and geddoe was an angel, so he was
unjustfully punished anyways :)
Morgana <mature> kinda like baine pking you
Morgana <mature> right?
Vian <mature> ------- levi arrested leviisgay: Mon Jan 16 01:41:08 2006
Vian <mature> ------- if anyone makes vianisgay I'll just eat your babies
Morgana <mature> prolly my ip
Abraxas <mature> would be kinda redundant
Sugarcandy <mature> hrm.. good idea vian
Morgana <mature> levi is gay too abraxas
Morgana <mature> way to know the facts
Vian <mature> ------- levi is my boyfriend
Vian <mature> ------- omg i cant remember his real name
Sugarcandy <mature> do y'all think if i started donating money to the mud i
could get stormy to stomp abra's toes regularly?
Majere <mature> If that is true
Sopboo <mature> vian
Vian <mature> ------- If you donate money to me regularly, I'll make you
another plushie :p
Sopboo <mature> marry me god damnit
Majere <mature> I'd have started 5 years ago
Morgana <mature> parents dont stomp on spoiled kids toes
Vian <mature> ------- I have my eyes on a certain archangel
Sugarcandy <mature> they might for money
Sopboo <mature> fine :D
Vian <mature> ------- hes this sexy novice sorcerer
Vian <mature> ------- his name rhymes with Nun
Vian <mature> ------- so I think hes pretty kinky
Sugarcandy <mature> lol
<mature> Yang pked him last night, he's a noob
<Cursed> Abraxas <forsaken> * go ahead and quit out *
Autosaving.
<Cursed> Yang <forsaken>  k

<Master> Vian <forsaken> I'm gonna have Nul add a restartheart to reject and
resign, and maybe mature on too

Sugarcandy <mature> at least i got him to apologize and start trying to act

Abraxas <mature> morgana needs a lesson in holding a job
Sopboo <mature> im just sayin 4 arms would come in handy
Morgana <mature> i have a job

Morgana <mature> haha
Sugarcandy <mature> how old are you dear?

You just thought you died didnt you?
Abraxas <mature> wasn't talking to you
Morgana <mature> no come back for that huh?
Vian <mature> ------- sugarcandy
Abraxas <mature> don't be so full of yourself
Vian <mature> ------- can we please sing disney
Sugarcandy <mature> yes dear?
Abraxas <mature> any semi-intelligent person would know I was talking to vian
Sugarcandy <mature> i'm sorry hon... i'm at work
Abraxas <mature> can't expect that from you though
Morgana <mature> yeah since you specified who you were talking to dumb ass
Morgana <mature> i didnt see any names in it, so its kind of up in the air,
yeah?
Abraxas <mature> maybe the guy who actually used wrong wording? no! couldn't
be!
Vian <mature> ------- I know I should just turn the mature line off
Vian <mature> ------- but i like to keep all lines on
Morgana <mature> yeah youre right.
Morgana <mature> my facts and wording was right. (:
Sugarcandy <mature> abra... did you know your insults come off as condescending
and a bit mentally impaired?
Morgana <mature> of course they do, hes a big fat tall retard
Morgana <mature> *virgin
Abraxas <mature> do you know morgana has you wrapped around his finger?
Sugarcandy <mature> i like to think it's the other way around really
Morgana <mature> being right doesnt mean anyones wrapped around my finger
Vian <mature> ------- Sugar, I think both of their insults are equally as bad
Sugarcandy <mature> this is true
Morgana <mature> people tend to follow the right side.
Morgana <mature> unless mentally impaired.
Sugarcandy <mature> but morgana didn't make a snide comment about me sucking
dick
Majere <mature> rather be wrapped around someones finger.... than a fathers
dick
Morgana <mature> thats true too
Vian <mature> ------- I thought that was me
Majere <mature> imo
Morgana <mature> haha
Sopboo <mature> gl peeps im gonna go get drunk i advise all of you to do the
same.
Abraxas <mature> sugar
Sugarcandy <mature> so it's a bit obvious what side i'm on here
Abraxas <mature> you are so horribly biased it's ridiculous
Morgana <mature> get drunk, able to put up with abraxas
Sugarcandy <mature> well of course i'm biased
Morgana <mature> why would she be biased towards you when you called her a cock
sucker?
<mature> Sopboo puts on his hat and his ridiculus sungasses. WoRd.
Sugarcandy <mature> you are trying to be snarky and failing miserable
Morgana <mature> youre fucking retarded
