     First I would like to begin by suggesting that any races you much go on a quest to become be removed from the list, certainly there is no point in suggesting one could become one and further more for those who do not know about quests (I believe quests should be well guarded and kept secret) would not be alerted to them. This makes it more interesting while subtly giving the player more to look for. Why should we just give it away that you need to quest for it?
