Just a series of guild suggestions.

   Thief - a normal rogue would be one who survives by way of stealing. this however is a guild of people who take for no real reason. Just because they can

   Merchant - One step closer to player run, but not dependant economy, counterpart to the thieves guild.

   Bounty Hunter - part one of the player run justice system. A guild devoted to the be all end all do all for money. This would mostly be in refernce to contracted PK'ing but could serve many other purposes.

   Region Officer / Police - counter-guild for bounty hunters. These players may arrest 'felons'.

   Treasure Hunter / Digger - a guild dedicated to finding treasures. They were originally part of a system I was going to try to create myself on overcast where there are 'artifact' of a particlarly powerful nature, in the spirit that there would only be one of any given artifact in existence, ever. But they may also be used in other respects as well.

   Pirate - This would work in respect to crews aboard ships at sea exploring and and such. mostly for the sake of role-play.

   Vampire - as a guild a vampire makes the most sense being both a race and a class before becomming a vampire and only gaining few extra powers. rather than being strictly a vampire as a race. or as a class. Once again mostly for the sake of role-play. Some races may be excluded from joining this guild.

   Smithy / Craftsman - For those who want the limited ability to create armor based on provided ores and minerals along with their skills and them distribute them to the merchants to market these items. or do so themselves as freelance merchants.
   weapons, armor, items, and in some cases magical items.
