     It seems to be that a cleric's alignment and powers should be based on the religion he follows. rather than the ridiculous idea that clerics are good and kataans are not.

     A kataan is merely a rogue-ish magic user that intentionally follows the darkness and the evil.

     A cleric however upholds the laws of the deity they worship. and as such gain powers from that deity
