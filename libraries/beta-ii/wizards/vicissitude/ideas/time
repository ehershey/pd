     Implement days of the week to match the days we have. with different names. making it callable, one could codievably create events based on what day of the week it is.

     for example, you could "give" something to someone on any given day and it may not do anything, but if someone were looking for it (on a particular day) giving them this object would constitute a deed or reward you in some other fashion.
