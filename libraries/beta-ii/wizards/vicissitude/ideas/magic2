     Magic Skills
*****************************************


 Evocation - Magic Attack
 Abjuration - Magic Defense
 Conjuration - Conjuring - Summoning
 Enchantment - Usually thrown in with Conjuring
     even though it is clearly a different 
     type of magic all together
Restoration - Healing
Entropy: ability to affect negative energies that are not
     one's own powers.
Nature
Faith
Psychic

those are the magic skills

along with these skills i think it would be wise to ditch Pyromancer
and in its place put Elementalist.

     At some point after you choose to be an elementalist you are asked to go and retrieve the symbol of the elemental magic you wish to profess.

     As soon as you retrieve the elemental symbol, then you will be made into a Mage of one of 6 elements
         Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Shadow

focusing most of your skills on magic revolving around the element you decided upon
