Bug reported by nightshade Thu Jul  6 21:34:29 2006:
/d/nopk/tirun/pubstart: Since you guys are working on bugs and stuff...  I
had someone tell me about a bug with auction.  Basically if you put an item
up for auction, then disconnect (dont know if just LD or quit) you can bid on
your own item.  and apparently you "win", getting your money doubled.  They
say this breaks auctions til reboot, but I'm sure it's nothing that an update
of the auction daemon wouldnt fix if you're going to test it.  They say you
can keep bidding on your own item and continually make more money

/d/guilds/darksoul/hall: if you get a druid to use their buffs on you before
you remort, it acts as your actual stats, so if your str is 100 and you get a
druid buff to raise strength to 110 and remort, instead of being 50 it will
be 55 and it wont change back

/d/freepk/merkkerri/jungle/merkkirri/msquare: Ok this is a majoy bug... if
you auction an item, bid then log off and log back on it will break the
auction line but not only that if someone bids on the item thats sorta just
on and off the auction line the money that person bids will double. so if
they bid a mil gold it will be like 2 mil and they can keep doing it... so
yeah that needs to be fixed.

missused by players. If I do move crate, a rat will pop up and attack me. If I
do move crate again another rate will come on and on and on. Perhaps an
alternative solution is better then to get rats over and over. A message saying
u move the crate and nothing happens if I am not supposed to get there that is.

/d/nopk/tirun/square: The forehead burn mark from non-angels wearing a halo. 
You can have more than one, and it really doesnt make sense to have more than
one.  Perhaps add an init() that looks for other instances and gets rid of
additional instances?  I think the code for the burn mark may be in
/wizards/inferno somewhere.  There or in the lodos dir.
