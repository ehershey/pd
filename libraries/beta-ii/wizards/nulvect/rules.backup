These are the rules you must abide by on Primal Darkness:
 
1. You may not harass anyone. If they ask you to stop, just apologize
   and be nice. This is supposed to be a fun experience. There is a harass
   log. The punishment for harassment varies but is never taken lightly.
 
2. The Primal Darkness Staff is not allowed to help mortals in any way 
   unless it is to fix some kind of bug. Any player and/or staff member 
   who breaks this rule will be instantly rid and banned for life. All of
   the Staff are to be respected. DO NOT ask a Staff member information
   that you know would be breaking the rules.
 
3. Although we try hard to make sure everything in the game works right,
   sometimes the code has unforseen bugs. Exploiting bugs is not allowed.
   Anyone who exploits bugs shall have all their characters deleted for 
   cheating. If you find a bug, use the bug command to report it and never
   try to use the bug again. A bug may consist of but is not limited to:
   gaining experience from doing nothing; advancing skills, stats, or 
   levels without using exp or doing a quest; fighting a mob that doesn't
   fight back; casting a spell on an object repeatedly to gain exp; 
   selling an item over and over and it does not leave your inventory;
   buying an item at a shop for 0 money; etc...
 
4. Player killing is allowed on Primal Darkness. There is a justice system
   in play and it is always evolving. Multiple PKs of the same character is
   harassment. Going on a PK spree is harassment. You must be level 20 before
   you can pk or be pked. Members of the same guild may not pick one person
   to pk multiple times. You or a  member of the guild you are in may only
   pk a single player once per 5 day period. PK in a nopk zone such as Tirun
   is also illegal and is considered bug abuse.
 
5. It is illegal to give away any quest/mini quest information for any
   reason. Quests may be done with another player, but both players must be
   activly questing. You may not finish a quest, and the other person just
   solves the end of it. The location of a subclass hall is mini quest info.
 
6. Multi-Playing is illegal. You may not be logged in with more than one
   character at any given time, with the exception of immortals and test 
   characters. You may not log in with one character, to get weapons or
   any other items for your alternates. You may not switch characters if 
   a friend needs anything from your alt.  You may not, at anytime,
   avenge a death with an alt. When switching characters, you must log your
   character off completely before logging another one on, link-dead characters
   on at the same time are multi-playing.
 
7. Spamming lines, says, tells, shouts, boards, or any other form of 
   communication is not allowed. Spamming is repeating something over 
   and over to annoy others. Spamming is harassment.
 
8. The auction line: Do not continually bid on an item you have put up for 
   auction, if you put something up for auction, bid on it once for the minimum
   price you wish to sell it for and do not bid on it again. Do not put
   worthless items such as stones, oil, meat, or things of this nature
   up for auction. Do not continually try to auction the same item over and
   over. If no one bids on your item the first time around, you should wait at
   least 10 minutes before putting that item up for auction again.
 
9. Profane language on open lines and boards is not allowed. Using it in 
   says, tells and on party lines is ok as long as it does not get out of 
   hand. If someone asks you to stop using that language to them or around 
   them, please respect their wishes. If you repeatedly ignore someone 
   asking you to stop using profanity around them, it becomes harassment.
 
10. Stealing kills is against the rules. If someone is killing a mob go find
    another to kill. You can't join them, help them, take their kill while 
    they rest one room away, or loot the corpse when they are done unless 
    you are partied together.
 
11. Scripting is not allowed. If you are going to play you must be at the
    keyboard entering any commands. If you are not at your keyboard, your
    character should be idle. There are no exceptions to this rule.
 
12. Please do not put down other muds here. Do not compare our mud to others
    on the lines. We have worked hard and hope you enjoy it. No one here cares
    if you think X mud is better or worse than this one. No one cares what you
    did on another mud. This mud is for playing and having fun; not bashing
    other muds; not bashing this mud; not bashing other games players, admins,
    etc. DO NOT discuss other muds here. 
 
13. The delivery system: Using scripting, speed walk programs, gate, fly or 
    any other forms of quick movement is against the rules. Anyone breaking 
    this rule will have all money and experience for up to 10 levels removed.
 
14. Feeding is illegal. Feeding is when a player is in a party and does 
    nothing but still gets the experience. If you are in a party, you should
    be helping in some way, this does not mean sitting in the square and
    mhealing either. If you are healing for the party you should be with the
    party in whatever room they are fighting in. Breaking this rule will 
    result in character deletion for everyone involved.
 
15. Character sharing is not allowed for reasons of character abuse by
    multiple parties. If you are found to be sharing a character with any
    one else, the shared character will be arrested and deleted. Everyone
    involved will be punished as well.
 
16. LAN Rules: If you are connecting from a LAN based connection with more
    than one player on at a time you are not allowed to exchange money or 
    items. PKing (Player Killing) while on a LAN is forbidden. Breaking LAN
    rules is an instant rid and possible banishment of the LAN's IP.
 
17. All finger info, enter and exit messages, title, description, etc. shall
    not contain lewd or offensive material. This includes, but is not limited
    to, referances to illegal activities, racial remarks, lewd behavior, or 
    anything else the Staff deems should not be allowed.
 
18. Stealthing your enter and exit messages with color or misleading 
    information is not allowed. An exit message should have a clear message
    of which direction you leave in.
 
19. Names shall be of a fantasy nature to fit in with the mud's fantasy 
    setting. It is for the admins to decide if a name is not of a fantasy
    nature. Names are hard to rule on and this rule will be very loosly
    enforced. Names such as newbiekiller, dontkillme, Imkool, etc are not
    allowed and will be rid from the mud.
 
  We re all here to have fun. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
  Rules will be enforced at an admin's discretion. Use common sense when
  deciding anything. Admins do and will update these rules as needed. We 
  suggest reading the rules at least on a monthly basis. For more on the 
  rules see the following topics to see more specific information:
