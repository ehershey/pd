level1/items/fillet.c:
  mentions Japanese.. not sure if this is ok

level1/armor/sp_signet.c:
  took !!! out of short desc... not appropriate... enough text changes to warrant
  backing the original file up in same dir

level1/weapons/pipe.c:
  the wield message doesn't make any sense

level1/monsters/blue_boy.c:
  fixed up the catch_tell code; changed "knocking Orvis into the water" to
  "knocking someone into the water" since you don't check if Orvis is still alive;
  took out an id that had colors in it;
  this mob is level 60, WAY too high for being in a newbie area which level 1 is supposed to be

level1/monsters/eel.c:
  he is set to use slash and bash, but has no weapons; he's also too low
  a level to use slash even if he did have some, cut would work though

level1/monsters/flounder.c:
  his level goes too high for a generic mob, he could be up to
  level 19.. needs to be more like 10+random(3)

level1/monsters/humpy.c:
  his level is WAY too high, try level 18 or so for an absolute MAX,
  and more like level 16ish

level1/monsters/manatee_mike.c:
  any level over 18 or so is not acceptable this close to tirun,
  EVEN IF the mobs are not meant to be attacked

level1/monsters/orvis.c:
  level far too high again

level1/monsters/oscar.c:
  level too high; both oscar and orvis are set to use whirl which will be
  changing in the very near future so you might want to change that

level1/monsters/pelican.c:
  level can go too high

level1/monsters/pelican_patty.c:
  level way too high (even for an invincible mob); her msg that throws you out
  of the room says Pelican Pete instead of Patty without checking if Pete is around

level1/monsters/pelican_paul.c:
  level and strength stat are too high; the damage done on his slam thing should be
  made to ensure that it can't kill the person (this is a NEWBIE area)

level1/monsters/pelican_pete.c:
  level too high

level1/monsters/seagull.c:
  level can go too high (up to 24)

level1/monsters/seal.c:
  level too high

level1/monsters/shedder.c:
  level is probably a little high for a "small bait fish"

level1/monsters/snail.c:
  level goes too high

level1/monsters/starfish.c:
  level probably on the high side for an animal that usually doesn't
  even move much, let alone fight

level1/monsters/stripper_bass.c:
  level too high; max hp too high; uses whirl which will be changing soon (might want to make it use something else)

level1/rooms/room-1f1.c:
  the sign here is not acceptable as it is 100% OOC;
  it MUST be changed

level1/rooms/room-1g7.c:
  the listen thing about pearls says there are 7 kinds,
  then only lists 6 kinds... I know it mentions the "rare" one after all that,
  but it should just say 6 in that case

level1/rooms/secret-1.c:
  the sign here is completely OOC, you MUST make it
  sound more like something a character in game would write,
  or else take it out entirely

level1/rooms/secret-2a.c:
  the level requirement for the dive command might need to be rethought,
  since this is supposed to be a newbie area...

level1/rooms/secret-2c.c:
  having all these very high level mobs attack someone is
  not something we want to do in a newbie area... maybe after
  their levels are lowered you can have one or two attack
