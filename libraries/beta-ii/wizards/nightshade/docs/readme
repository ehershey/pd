Note:  These are all a bunch of emails that I wrote to a group of people that were interested in learning how to code in LPC.  It is quite informal, and may skip certain topics.  If you have a question about something, want to send me one of your tests, or want me to write a new one, just send me an email at nightshade@threekings.hispeed.com.  Good Luck!
