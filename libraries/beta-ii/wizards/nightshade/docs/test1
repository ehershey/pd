Ok.  Misty said he wanted a test to make sure he understood, so I figured I'd send it out to everyone.  You don't have to do it, it's up to you.  Here goes:

The message() function is used to send messages to people.  You need to input 3 things for it to work.  The first is the type of message.  "info" will do for now.  The second is the message to be sent.  The last is who it gets sent to.  Here's an example:

message("info", "Nightshade is the coolest!", this_player());

In that line, the current player would see:

Nightshade is the coolest!

So, using this information, I want you to declare a string and an object.  Give the string any value you want, and make the object users().  (users refers to anyone in the game).  Then use both those variables in the message command.  Don't worry about functions or {}s.

Part 2:

variables can be added, subtracted..  ints can be multiplied and divided, too.  for instance:

string night, shade, total;    //use a comma to declare multiple variables

night = "this is a";
shade = "easy test";

total = night + shade;

In the first line we declared 3 strings.  total equals "this is aeasy test".  no, I didn't type-o, you need to be sure to add spaces when adding strings or you'll get what we have here.  objects can't be added, subtracted, etc.  ints can do anything that you usually do with numbers.  Example:

int first, second;

first = 5;
second = 7;

//the following is not code..  just saying what they equal

first + second = 12
first * second = 35
and so on.  Now for the part where you do something...

Make an int, and give it a value and a name.  make an object equal this_player().  then give this_player() some exp using your int.
hint:  to give a player 500 exp, it looks like this:  

this_player()->add_exp(500);

Good Luck!
