This is a small area within an area.  It will include a path
to an alchemical lab.  Something happened here that caused the
changes in the animals on the island. Perhaps have a room that
has a 'poor' trapped creature, which upon release thanks the
player by trying to eat him/her.

UPDATE: Contains the alchemical lab rooms only.  The
        jungle subdir contains the paths in the isle.
