Cenn told me that his coin wasn't doing anything. I looked over it and saw that it was disabled, and told him that I wouldn't be able to do anything about it. He told me that the reason it was disabled was because you used to be able to spam it, and asked me to fix it so that he could use it.

This version has been modified to make it not spammable. However, I don't really see the point, as the coin only lands once before it is deleted.
