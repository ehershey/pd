taken from /daemon/mapper.c on August 17th, 2008

fixes an issue where a player's room description with maps on can only have up to a specific number of newline entries on it, where after a certain point all extra newline entries are removed and printed as regular spaces

does not attempt to map out the environment if is_room() is false.

Fixes an error where the map would be incorrectly offset by 1 character if the line size is 1 less than the amount that would require the mapper to print a new line.
