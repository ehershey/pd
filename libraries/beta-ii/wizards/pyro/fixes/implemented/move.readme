Taken from /std/move.c on August 21st 2008

Adds support for receiving rooms that wish to redirect incoming objects to different rooms

--change log:
If the room/object the object was to be moved into returns 0 at ob->receive_object(this_object()), then the room will be checked for a redirect function, query_redirect(this_object()). The object will then attempt to move itself into the room given by query_redirect(). If that move completes successfully, move will return MOVE_REDIRECTED;
