DAY
   "Riverbanks soar high above, making it feel like a maze.",
   "The dirt is dried up and cracked.",
   "The vertical banks, makes the thought of climbing out vanish.",
   "Grooves, left behind by the river, appear everywhere.",
   "Grass can be seen up on top of the banks, swaying in the breeze.",
   "The riverbed serves as a pathway through nature's makeshift maze.",
   "A buzzing noise echoes through the riverbanks.",
   "Piles of rubble is stacked along the sides of the banks.",
   "Little patches of grass sprouts between the cracks.",
   "A wide winding path leads through the banks.",
   "Rubble of all sizes, litters the ground.",
   "Debries left behind, makes walking a little difficult.",
   "A light breeze blows through.",
   "A slight haze appears over the ground.",
   "Long shadows are casted by the towering banks.",
   "A small pile of bones exist in a shallow cave.",
   "A puddle of water boils under the hot sun.",
   "A stone tumbles down the side.",
   "The pathway narrows up ahead.",
   "Small glowing eyes appear inside the deep crevince.",
NIGHT
   "The water that once ran through this riverbed has dried up many moons ago.",
   "By the light of the fire-flies, the dark and creepy banks tower high above the river floor.",
   "The walls protect against the cold night breeze.",
   "Between the light of a moon and fire-flies, strange shadows creep around.",
   "Shadows dances under the light of the fire-flies.",
   "With little light to go by, the steep banks almost feels like they are closing in.",
   "Feeling entrapped by the walls, a panic attack sets in.",
   "A strange noise echoes through, sending a chill of goose bumps and fear in the air.",
   "Cracks in the mud opens up, waiting for an unsuspecting prey to fall in.",
   "Loose gravel crunches underneath.",
   "Mosquitos buzzes around, hungry for a meal.",
   "Small stones rains from above as the ground shifts.",
   "Small glowing eyes appear inside a deep crevince.",
   "Rubble of all sizes, litters the ground.",
   "The smell of smoke mixed in with a gentle breeze blows through.",
   "A wide winding path leads through the banks.",
   "A small puddle of water reflects the greatness of the moon.",
   "Something darted through the shadows up ahead.",
   "Light flickers off the stones.",
   "Sounds of crickets chirping fills the air.",
