Levi tells you: There are 1000 places to idle in this game.  I reccomend you pick a different one.

You reply to Levi: ~~* dude *~~

Levi tells you:This is one of those petty things that you could be fixing for yourself, thereby eliminating the need for me to take valuable time out of sleep/essay writing to do it for you.

You reply to Levi: ~~* do you not care about the actual rules in the game? or do you just like to go with the cussing angle?  there are more than just cussing that is wrong with the game ya know *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* hey now, you signed up to be an immortal *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* you get the jobs that go with it *~~

Levi replies: The rule prohibits the TARGETING of a specific individual.  You aren't being targetted, and even if you were you could just leave the room. Don't patronize me.  I wrote these rules and I know them a lot better than you.

Levi tells you: Also, no staff members owes you anything on this game.  Start showing some respect instead of acting like you aren't getting a service that you've paid for.

You reply to Levi: ~~* I am not patronizing you, and you didnt write them...you refined them dont take credit you for things you ddint do.  and i know noone owes me anything...the fact of the matter is levi, is you dont like me, so you do everything you can to make my life a living hell...ME i actually care about other people in the game that are too afraid of the imms and admins and will take thier concerns with mine to you guys.  BUT you dont care about anyone but yourself and have no intention on making the mud better for anyone but your
supposed friends and yourself.  you are not a fair immortal, and many people feel that way. *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* as a person, i personally like you...off the game and I am sorry that i dont on the game...but all i do is try to make the mud a fair place for everyone *~~

Levi tells you: You're right, I don't like you.  Stop trying to use that as a weapon against me.  I try really really hard to do my job objectively.  I've been criticized a lot by other players for letting you get away with murder. If I was only out for myself, you'd already be gone.  Would you prefer that?

You reply to Levi: ~~* how have I gotten away with murder? *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* i never pk on here *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* and if i do...the person tells me i can *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* so please answer me that one *~~

Levi tells you: It's a figure of speech.  You antagonize other players and staff members subtly without ever breaking a rule overtly.

You reply to Levi: ~~* i dont antagonize players...if you ask most of them, they like me...some dont but that is the game..  and staff the only ones i dont like are you and azire *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* the other ones i am cool with *~~

Levi tells you:The part that I don't get is why you play a game where you think that the Law is out to get you.

You reply to Levi: ~~* i dont think the law is out to get me *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* i never actually said it did *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* now did i? *~~

Levi tells you:"you

Levi tells you:"you

You reply to Levi: ~~* me *~~

Levi tells you:do everything you can to make my life a living hell"

You reply to Levi: ~~* no, i bring you things that i and others complain about*~~

Levi replies: I was quoting you.

You reply to Levi: ~~* oh really? and when did i say this? *~~

Levi replies: Last tell.

You reply to Levi: ~~* OH yay! ok i was thining it but didnt remember saying it. *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* thinking rather *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* the thing is Levi, is you do play favorites and you do have people you dont like and you do try to go after them *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* you dont like furiae either *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* I understand you dont like us and I am not saying you have to *~~

Levi tells you: I have favourite players but they don't benefit from being my favourites.  I treat everyone equally.

You reply to Levi: ~~* all I am saying is to practice what you preech and actually be objective *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* b/c NO *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* everyone is NOT treated = by you *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* if they were, players would not come to me complaining *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* the thing is, is you and I used to be cool, even somewhat friends *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* then you became an immortal and for some reason
immediatly switched into hating me *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* and now you tell me things like, "if you defend yourself i will never help you" *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* then i dont defend myself, tell you or do a harass log about something, as you are the law guy *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* and you do nothing *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* now tell me...is that really "fair" *~~

Levi tells you: No, I'm pretty sure the bottom line is that I've cut off your supply of special treatment, and now that you're on the level with everyone else you've deluded yourself into believing that I'm out to get you.  I'm not. I kind of wish I was, since apparently everyone thinks I am, but I'm not.

You reply to Levi: ~~* i never had special treatment *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* i talk to people, that doesnt mean i have special treatment *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* and you have said yourself you dont like me and that if it were up to you I would be gone *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* with that much pent up anomosity, you know something is bound to show *~~

Levi replies: You don't send me a harass log because I am the log guy?  That's your weakest link.

You reply to Levi: ~~* i am not a child levi *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* i am not stupid *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* and i have done harass logs *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* and whit even checked it out and saw that i did *~~
You reply to Levi: ~~* and you still did nothing *~~

Levi replies: You have absolutely no idea what it do, because being objective, I don't send you reports of my activities.

You reply to Levi: ~~* what is it? and what it do means what? *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* and you send reports over the newbie line all the time *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* b/c you are always so proud of when you punish *~~

Levi tells you:You're putting words in my mouth, by the way.  It is up to me, and you're still here.  That's my argument for why I'm objective. 

You reply to Levi: ~~* i never put words into your mouth, and if i did it was at the beginning and you even admitted i was right *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* I have not done anything wrong on this mud *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* i have never cheated and i dont break rules *~~

Levi replies: LOL

You reply to Levi: ~~* yes laugh please do and then tell, please tell me what rules i have broken, and I mean real good rules other than "lmfao" *~~

Levi tells you:All of the rules are good ones.

You reply to Levi: ~~* if you truely thought that...than you would say
something about not spammin areas with nonsense...now wouldnt you? *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* as that is a rule *~~

You reply to Levi: ~~* yeah what i thought, convo is indeed over.  all i ask is that you treat people fairly. thank you for your time *~~
