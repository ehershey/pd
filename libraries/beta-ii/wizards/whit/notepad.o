Galdur reports multiple unbalanced items, as well as a teleportation item.","Gore":"Check gore for combat initiate checkings.","this_object()":"Functions inside appear to still be called because of heartbeats after destruction.","Summons":"Bugs about summons attacking lower than 20 players.  Also attacking in Tirun for no outlaw.","Combat":"Fix combat.  Multiple PK offences.  Better check and balance system for disable and casting.","sage_room.c":"  Take a look at heart_beat() function.  Around 182.  Possibly calling map_delete too soon.","Multiple Arena":"Fix arena better to include multiple arenas, etc.",])
