from now on to connect to pd, use %^BOLD%^mud.iuis.org%^RESET%^ port %^BOLD%^5000%^RESET%^.

you should start using this address now, so when we have to repoint it
to the new address of phase 2, you can play right away.

phase 2 will be hosted on my server instead of on seeker's, as it is now.
this relocation is benefitial to you all, as it will be on my multi
procssor FreeBSD server in the only class A datacenter in hawaii, home
to my company's multi-homed bgp4 routed 155mbit backbone, which spans
across a third of the planet.

needless to say, this should make playing a lot more enjoyable for all,
as we wont have to worry about lag and similar detriments.

phase 2 is expected to be open for public playing sometime in late june.
please finish any areas you might be working on before then, so we can
add them in... thanks to all our current players for beta testing hase 1
of primal darkness, and for our builders who put so much time into their
areas!

your idle co-admin,

wiz
