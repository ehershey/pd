Coaching is a new form of transportation found on the continent of 
Bastuul. The coaches travel between the larger cities, and players
can pay for a ticket on any of their current routes. Note that not
all stations actually travel to all locations- some take only
specific routes.

To hop on a coach, simply use:

<coach to [place]>

The length and cost of the journey will depend to where you wish
to travel and the cost is partially dependant on your level.
