His belly and underside bear appear to have avoided the worst of the damage, but are still heavily damaged. The once-proud line of spines which ran from the back of his head down his neck is little more then a line of melted globs, the flesh between each burnted away. His wings are charred flaps of ash. Small wisps of smoke rise up from between his scales, showing he has only recently become deceased. His legs are curled up against his belly protectively, but such instincts are of little use against the burn of electricity.");
