Bug reported by nightshade Thu Jul  6 21:34:29 2006:
/d/nopk/tirun/pubstart: Since you guys are working on bugs and stuff...  I
had someone tell me about a bug with auction.  Basically if you put an item
up for auction, then disconnect (dont know if just LD or quit) you can bid on
your own item.  and apparently you "win", getting your money doubled.  They
say this breaks auctions til reboot, but I'm sure it's nothing that an update
of the auction daemon wouldnt fix if you're going to test it.  They say you
can keep bidding on your own item and continually make more money

/d/freepk/merkkerri/jungle/merkkirri/msquare: Ok this is a majoy bug... if
you auction an item, bid then log off and log back on it will break the
auction line but not only that if someone bids on the item thats sorta just
on and off the auction line the money that person bids will double. so if
they bid a mil gold it will be like 2 mil and they can keep doing it... so
yeah that needs to be fixed.

You can have more than one, and it really doesnt make sense to have more than

/d/distopia/room/nexus: Amun tells me that all healing items share the same
source code. But, I was fighting a brigand and got from 870 hp down to 251. 3
oils fully restored my hp. Fought another brigand and had my hp reduced to 316.
It took 9 souls from the Darksoul hall to restore hp to 870. It did exactly 60hp
every time without fail. Would you be so kind as to look into this for me? Thank
you.

/d/lodos/etown7: I have noticed a bug with absorb. I can run in, absorb and run
out before the spell harms the monster...but I still get the hp. Using this, I
could have a steed handy and milk em without hurting em and never need oils. If
the inherit could come with the damage, I am sure that'd solve the problem.
Thanks for listening. :)
