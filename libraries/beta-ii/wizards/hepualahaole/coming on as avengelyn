i got the code for the pig, but dont know how to work out the exp, like it wouldn't be cool if people killed it, but if it was level 100, i wouldn't want it to give any exp, or any level is fine..


#include <std.h>
inherit MOUNT


void create() {
    ::create()

   set_name("pig")

   set_id( ({ "pig" }) )

   set_short("A Flying Pig")

  set_level(100)

   set_long("The flying pig is big, fat, pink and has large white feathery wings "
     "making it able to fly.....This is a flying pig!! wow!!")

    set_body_type("equine")

   set_id(({"horse"}))

    set_race("pig")

   set_gender("male")

   set_emotes(10, ({"The Pig Snorts loudly.", "The Pig flaps his wings and flies around the room for a little while."}))

}
