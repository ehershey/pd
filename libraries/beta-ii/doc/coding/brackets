=====================================================================

There are three sets of brackets that are used to code in LPC.
Each one has it's own use and applications.

%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^The %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^(   )%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^ brackets.

These brackets are used for the following purposes;

      1) Standard mathematical applications. They are used to control
         the logical flow of a mathematical equation.

      2) Function pointers. They are used to house the variables being
         passed into the function. See %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^coding functions%^RESET%^.
%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^The %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^{   }%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^ brackets.

These brackets are the workhorses of the LPC language. Several
statements use them to surround and define a block of statements to be
run under certain conditions. The main body of a function is housed
inside a set of {} brackets. Please see the coding files for the
following files;

     for      while        do       if       switch
      functions

%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^The %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^[   ]%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^ brackets.

This set of brackets are used for indexing. Please see coding indexing,
coding mapping, and coding arrays for more information.
