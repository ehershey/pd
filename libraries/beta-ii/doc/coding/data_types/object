The Object datatype is used as a way to referance programs in the LPC language.
These programs are called "objects" in this style of coding. Once the object is
referanced with a object type variable, You make access the functions (a.k.a.
subroutines for those familiar with linear coding and not object coding )
contained inside of the object with the -> operator. See %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^coding operators%^RESET%^.

-----< Declaring an object variable >-----

object TP;

This line sets up the variable TP to be an object variable.

-----< Assigning a value to an object variable >-----

object TP;

TP=this_player();

The first line declares the variable TP to be an object datatype. The second
line assigns the value returned from the efun this_player().

-----< Declaring and assigning value to an object variable >-----

object TP=this_player();

This line declares the variable TP to be an object and gives it the value
returned from the efun this_player();

-----< referancing info from objects with -> operators >-----

object TP=this_player();
string my_name = TP -> query_name();
string my_race = TP -> query_race();
int my_lvl = TP -> query_level();

The above lines declare a series of variables and assignes values to them.
The first line declares the variable TP as stated in the last section.
The second line declares a string called my_name and uses TP with ->
to referance the function query_name() from within the object referanced
by TP. The third line does the same for the variable my_race but referances
the function called query_race(). The last line sets up an int variable
called my_lvl and referances query_level() from the object TP with the ->
operator.
