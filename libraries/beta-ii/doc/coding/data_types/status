Meant to hold a 1 or a 0 and thus represents true or false; equivalent in intention to a boolean type. In most drivers it is implemented as an int, and so actually can hold other values.

Usually the documentations don't include this information but i felt it
should be since you CAN declare a variable using this datatype.
