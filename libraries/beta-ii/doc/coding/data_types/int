The int datatype is used to store whole numbers. In the event that a decimal is
stored into an int type variable, It will get rounded off. See %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^coding float%^RESET%^ if
you need to use decimals instead of whole numbers. I strongly suggest avoiding
decimals if you can help it.

%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^-----< Declaring an int >-----

int my_level;

This line starts the int variable called my_level.

%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^-----< Assigning values to an int >-----

my_level=10;

This line sets the variable to a value of 10.

%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^-----< Using operators with int types >-----

int targ_lvl;
int my_lvl;

targ_lvl = 10;
my_lvl = targ_lvl * 3;

This section of code starts the two variables targ_lvl and my_lvl as int
datatypes. It then sets targ_lvl to a value of 10. The my_lvl variable is
then set to targ_lvl * 3 using the operators = and *.

%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^-----< Declaring AND assigning value to int types >-----

int targ_lvl = 10;
int my_lvl = targ_lvl * 3;

These lines functionally do the same thing as the 4 lines in the last section
but does it in two lines. First it declares targ_lvl and gives it a value of
10. Next it declares the variable my_lvl and gives it a value of targ_lvl * 3.
