Sometimes during the execution of switch, for or while statements
it becomes necessary to abort execution of the block code and start
over from the top of the for or while loop you're running. To do
that, you use the continue statement. 

sum = 0;
for (i = 0 ; i < 10000 ; i++)
{
    if (i % 2) continue;

    sum += i;
}

What this sample of code is doing is using the continue statement
to force the for loop to skip every other pass of the loop. When
continue is hit, control is passed back to the for statement.
