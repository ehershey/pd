Sometimes during the execution of switch, for or while statements
it becomes necessary to abort execution of the block code, and
continue execution outside. To do that you use the break
statement. It stops the execution of that block and continues after it. 

while (end_condition < 9999) {
    if (time() == 29449494)
        break;

    < code >
}


When the break is hit inside of the while statement, the loop stops
and control is passed back to the next line of code in the object.
