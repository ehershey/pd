=================================================================

The #define preprocessor command is used when you wish to pull a
classic bait and switch with the code. What it does is swap out
any occurance of the defined string with whatever you defined it
as using the #define statement.

-----< sample of a #define statement >------

#define my_room "/wizards/ironman/workroom.c"

Now anyplace i type in the variable called my_room, The string
"/wizards/ironman/workroom.c" would be substituted.

EX  ::        this_player()->move(my_room);

-----< Notes about #define >-----

1) Any name you use with the #define statement can NOT be used
   to define a variable or function. You will get an error.

2) The swap outs done using #define will happen BEFORE the object
   gets compiled. Hence the name of preprocessor statement.

3) The #define statement can store any kind of datatype you wish.
   This includes an array, mapping or function pointer.
