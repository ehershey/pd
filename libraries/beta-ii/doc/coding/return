     return %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<values>%^RESET%^;


The return statement is used exclusively within a function. What
the statement does is terminates the function and returns control
back to whatever function called it. Any %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<values>%^RESET%^ is sent back
to the function that called this one.

Let's explain this a bit clearer now.

string query_name() { return my_name; }

This function would return the string contained inside the 
variable called my_name. Note that the value returned by this
statement must be the SAME type as the type of function.

for more information.

%^RED%^%^BOLD%^------------< Special Notes >-----------

  1) The return statement will immediately terminate a function
      and turn control back to whatever called the function. This
      includes for, while, and do loops.

   2) The return statement will also terminate the function
       from within a switch.
