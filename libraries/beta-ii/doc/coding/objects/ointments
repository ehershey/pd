The first thing you do for ointments is use the OINTMENT inherit.
Of course you will set the same basic functions as you do all
objects.

The following functions are the additional functions that you
must define for the OINTMENT inherit to work.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_your_mess_limb(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<User's message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);
%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_their_mess_limb(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<Room's message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);

     These two functions are used to define the messages the user and the
     room the user is standing in will see when the OINTMENT is used on a
     limb.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_your_mess_all(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<User's message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);
%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_their_mess_all(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<Room's message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);
     These two functions are used to define the messages the user and the
     room the user is standing in will see when the OINTMENT is used in
     general.


%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_action("%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<use command> <OINTMENT's ID>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^");   
     This function defines the execution command to use the OINTMENT.
     %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<use command>%^RESET%^ is oviously the command to use the OINTMENT.
     %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<OINTMENT's ID>%^RESET%^ is one of the ID's you defined in the object's %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^set_id()%^RESET%^.
