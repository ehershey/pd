-------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the things you MUST do in building armour:

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^::create();
       Make sure you call this always first thing in the function %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^create()%^RESET%^!

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_name("helmet");
	This gives the helmet a name, how it will often be referred to in the
	game as far as messages to mortals are concened.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_id( ({ "helm", "helmet" }) );
	This gives the helmet a means of being referred to.  The basic
	difference between name and id is between output and input.  The game
	makes references to objects using name, player reference objects using
	ids.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_short("The helmet of love");
	This is the short description of the helmet.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_long("People who love wear this helmet.");
	This is what players see when they look at the item.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_type("helmet");
	Armours have many different types.  You will have to refer to the mud's
	document on armours to find out what the legal types are.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_ac(5);
	Sets the protection the limbs covered by the armour will get for
	wearing the armour.  See the balance documents for limits.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_limbs( ({ "head" }) );
	Sets the limbs which the armour item protects.
	The item can be set up to protect more than one limb, but there are
	guidelines for which limbs can be protected by which armour types.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_weight(167);
	Sets how much the armour weighs.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_value(300);
	Sets the value of the item in gold.  Conversion to other currencies is
	done by the objects that need to convert them.

That is all you need to do to create a simple armour object.  However, there
many other neat functions for creating a more interesting item object.

*******************************************************************************

Optional functions:
-------------------

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_wear("You feel safer in the helmet of love.\n");
	This changes the message a player gets when wearing an item from:
		You wear A helmet.
	to:
		You feel safer in the helmet of love.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_wear( (: extra_worn :) );
	This tells the armour object that you have written a function called
	%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^extra_worn()%^RESET%^ in the object that has this line.  In other words, you
	wrote the %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^extra_worn()%^RESET%^ function in the helmet if it this function
	if written in %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^create()%^RESET%^ of the helmet, or you wrote %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^extra_worn()%^RESET%^
        To use this technique, you must do the following 3 steps in your
        armor's file;
                1) Make sure that %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^set_wear()%^RESET%^ is set to read
                      %^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_wear( (: extra_worn :) );
                2) Make sure you have a global variable declared
                  as follows;
                       %^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^int extra_worn();
                3) Define your %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^extra_worn()%^RESET%^ function as an %^CYAN%^int%^RESET%^ NOT
                   as a %^CYAN%^void%^RESET%^ and that it is OUTSIDE of the %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^create()%^RESET%^
                   section.

        Have your %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^extra_worn()%^RESET%^ function return a %^RED%^%^BOLD%^1%^RESET%^ to allow it to be worn.
        Have your %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^extra_worn()%^RESET%^ function return a %^RED%^%^BOLD%^0%^RESET%^ to block it from being
           worn.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_unwear("You do not feel like loving any more.");
        Similar to %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^set_wear()%^RESET%^ except for when the thing is removed.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_unwear( (: extra_remove :) );
        Similar to %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^set_wear()%^RESET%^ except for removing.
        You only need to substitute extra_remove in place of
        extra_worn.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set("read", "May you love while you wear this helmet.");
	This makes it so that when a player types:
		read helmet    OR     read writings
	the player gets written back:
		"May you love while you wear this helmet."

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_property("magic item", ({ "illuminate" }) );
	Gives the armour the magic property of responding to the
        command illimunate by lighting the room for a bit.  No clue
	that this property exists in the object should be given, since
	there are some magic users who will be able to magically sense
	this magic property in the armour.


****************************************************************************

Making an armour object magical:

If you want to add a magical propert to an armour item, do the following

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_property("magic item", ({ "command" }) );

This lets people who sense magical properties in objects sense that
property.  You must, of course, add the action and define the function
yourself. :)

This file lists the MAIN functions that you may use for your armors.
There are other techniques you can learn to code in time.
The functions listed above will get you started on building
your first pieces.
