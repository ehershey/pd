Making oils is a simple process. For the most part, they are a basic %^MAGENTA%^OBJECT%^RESET%^
with a few additional functions added in. You will inherit %^MAGENTA%^OIL%^RESET%^ instead of
%^MAGENTA%^OBJECT%^RESET%^ then setup all the basic function for %^MAGENTA%^OBJECT%^RESET%^. First set up the oil's
name, short description, long description, ids, weight and value. Next, You
define the following functions in the OIL's %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^create()%^RESET%^ section;

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_your_mess(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<user's message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);
%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_their_mess(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<room's message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);

     These two functions set the strings that will be displayed to the
     user of your OIL and the room they are located in. Place $N in
     the message strings at the locations you wish the user's name
     to appear.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_heal_mess(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<user's healing message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);

     This function set the string that will be displayed to the user
     when the OIL's healing takes affect on them.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_uses(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<a number from 1 to 15>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);

     This function accepts an integer from 1 to 15. This integer
     represents the number of doses your oil will have.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_action(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<user's execution command>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);
     This is the command that the user must enter along with
     one of the OIL's ids to use it.
