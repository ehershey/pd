Each domain of Primal Darkness has its own legal tender for currency.
The legal currency of the main town of Praxis is %^YELLOW%^gold%^RESET%^ coins.  No other
type of money is accepted in the main town, although the main bank
will exchange among all types of currencies.  Other domains may accept
only 1 of the following %^CYAN%^platinum%^RESET%^, %^ORANGE%^electrum%^RESET%^, %^YELLOW%^gold%^RESET%^, %^BOLD%^silver%^RESET%^, %^RED%^copper%^RESET%^.
The default values set up by BALANCE will be set up in terms of %^YELLOW%^gold%^RESET%^ coins.
You must %^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_value()%^RESET%^ on all objects in %^YELLOW%^gold%^RESET%^ coins.  But your pubs and shops
will convert that value into the currency of your domain.
If you wish to add money to you monsters, You use add the following line
to the monster's %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^create()%^RESET%^ section;

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_money(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<currency>%^RESET%^,%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<value>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);
      The %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<currency>%^RESET%^ is any of the 5 listed above. The %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<value>%^RESET%^ is how much
      money you wish your monster to possess.

To add money to your rooms, add the following lines of code to you room's
%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^create()%^RESET%^ section;

	money = new("/std/obj/coins");
	money->set_money("platinum", 2);
	money->set_money("copper", 3000);
	money->move(this_object());

	This will move a pile of 2 %^CYAN%^platinum%^RESET%^ coins and 3000 %^RED%^copper%^RESET%^ coins into the room.
        You must define the variable money as an object either within the %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^create()%^RESET%^
        section of your monster/room or define it globally within the
       monster/room.

See the balance document on money to learn what legal amounts are.
The exchange rate is as follows

1 %^CYAN%^platinum%^RESET%^ = 10 %^YELLOW%^gold%^RESET%^ = 100 %^ORANGE%^electrum%^RESET%^ = 500 %^BOLD%^electrum%^RESET%^ = 1000 %^RED%^copper%^RESET%^
