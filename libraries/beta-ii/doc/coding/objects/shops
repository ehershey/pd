Creating a shop on Primal Darkness is much simpler than it is on most muds,
even though the economic system is a bit more complex.  This is because we
have an inheritable shopkeeping monster called %^MAGENTA%^VENDOR%^RESET%^.
In this %^MAGENTA%^VENDOR%^RESET%^ is all of the code that would be needed by any buy/sell shop.
Unfortunately, it is not as simple as inheriting the %^MAGENTA%^MONSTER%^RESET%^ inheritable.
In addition to inheriting and customizing the %^MAGENTA%^VENDOR%^RESET%^ for your needs, you have
to build the room in which the monster will be placed (the shop)
and a storage area for all items the shop has for sale.  These are just simple
rooms.

Necessary things to set in the %^MAGENTA%^VENDOR%^RESET%^
------------------------------------

see %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^help monsters%^RESET%^ for info on the monster customizing settings
that are necessary and optional.  All info in that tutorial is applicable
here as well, since the %^MAGENTA%^VENDOR%^RESET%^ inherits %^MAGENTA%^MONSTER%^RESET%^

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_currency("gold");
	This function tells the inheritable vendor what kind of currency it
	is to accept in its shop.  Each area on Primal darkness is supposed
	to accept only one type of currency.  The vendor automatically does
	all conversions into its currency.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_storage_room("/d/standard/storage");
	This tells the vendor where all the items to be sold are stored.
        Make sure that the storage room either checks to see if the person
       is an immortal with %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^creatorp()%^RESET%^ or has no enterance at all.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_skill("bargaining", 90);
	The price a player gets for selling an object, or is charged for 
	buying one is related %^RED%^%^BOLD%^1)%^RESET%^ to the players bargaining skill, %^RED%^%^BOLD%^2)%^RESET%^ to the
	vendor's bargaining skill, %^RED%^%^BOLD%^3)%^RESET%^ to the player's charisma.
	So it is therefore necessary that you set the vendor's bargaining.
	No shop may have a vendor with a bargaining skill lower than %^RED%^%^BOLD%^50%^RESET%^.
