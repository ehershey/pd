In all rooms or things in which players may enter, you need to specify a light
value for it using %^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_light(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^x%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^)%^RESET%^; where %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^x%^RESET%^ is an integer representing the light
available to any player in the room, without adjustments for torches and such.
The following is a table of light values for different situations:

Outdoors:
   %^MAGENTA%^below -3%^RESET%^: pitch black sky, usually indicating a magic darkness
   %^MAGENTA%^      -3%^RESET%^: a starless, moonless night sky
   %^MAGENTA%^      -2%^RESET%^: a starlit, moonless night
   %^MAGENTA%^      -1%^RESET%^: A night lit by a not-so bright moon
   %^MAGENTA%^       0%^RESET%^: Full moon night
   %^MAGENTA%^       1%^RESET%^: Night in a well lit town area, or late twilight
   %^MAGENTA%^       2%^RESET%^: Shadowy areas, early twilight, day with heavy cloud cover
   %^MAGENTA%^       3%^RESET%^: Average daylight
   %^MAGENTA%^       4%^RESET%^: Unusually bright daylight
   %^MAGENTA%^       5%^RESET%^: Blindingly bright daylight (too bright for most beings to see)

Indoors:
   %^MAGENTA%^      -5%^RESET%^: Magically darkned area.  No light exists.
   %^MAGENTA%^      -4%^RESET%^: Magically, darkened, but not as dark as a -5
   %^MAGENTA%^      -3%^RESET%^: Pitch black, no light sources
   %^MAGENTA%^      -2%^RESET%^: Very weak light sources
   %^MAGENTA%^      -1%^RESET%^: Weak light source, but still too dark for most to function
    %^MAGENTA%^      0%^RESET%^: Fairly weak lighting, but bright enough to see movement
    %^MAGENTA%^      1%^RESET%^: Dimly lit room
    %^MAGENTA%^      2%^RESET%^: A room of average lighting
    %^MAGENTA%^      3%^RESET%^: A brightly lit room
    %^MAGENTA%^      4%^RESET%^: A very bright room, usually because of a magic light source.
    %^MAGENTA%^      5%^RESET%^: Blindlingly, magically lit room

Keep in mind that any light value is acceptable.  If you want something so
magically darkened that no one may ever see in it, %^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_light(-1000);%^RESET%^
But any values greater than 5 or less than -5 indicate magic at use.
Indeed, in some cases, numbers within that range indicate magic at work.
