Making stones is a simple process. You inherit STONE instead of OBJECT and
set the name, ids, short and long description like you do for every object.

The following functions are specifically for stones;

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_use_mess(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<user's message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);

     This funtion shows the string you enter for %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<user's message>%^RESET%^ to
     the user at the time the stone is "rubbed" or otherwise used.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_remove_mess(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<user's message>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);

      This function sets the message that the person sees when the STONE
      stops working and decays to nothing.

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_action(%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<user's command>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^);

      The string you enter into %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<user's command>%^RESET%^ is the execution command
      for using your STONE.
%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_levels( ({%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<levels of decay>%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^}) );
      
      This function allows you to enter an array of strings to define the
     levels of decay your STONE will proceed thru.

%^RED%^%^BOLD%^EXAMPLE :

%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^set_levels( ({ "dull","tarnished","scratched","smooth","immaculate" }) );

      The levels proceed from right, best condition, to left, worst condition.
