This file is directed towards the use of Shadows.  I'm dead serious
about upholding ALL of these rules.  Shadows are just too dangerous
to fuck around with.

Essentially, shadows are to be used ONLY for players in the game.  All
shadows must, I repeat, must be approved by an arch.  I'm sorry if
this seems paranoid, however I feel it is unavoidable.
Anyone found with a shadow can get anywhere from a warning to permanent
site banishment.  This excludes shadows that are approved...arches, please
write down which shadows you do approve, so they can be checked out.
You won't have any problems if you use this function with discretion,
and without intent to hurt the game.  Shadows can be fun, but they
can also be very dangerous.
