A player may own a house anywhere on the main continent, as long
as it is set in a town and there is room for it. Each town has a 
'housing district' where houses may be built if you wish your 
house to be in a town. 
  
    One room house:   75,000 gold

If you are interested in buying a house, please speak to one of 
the staff. You can get a 10% discount if you have the knowledge
and wish to 'build' the house yourself.
