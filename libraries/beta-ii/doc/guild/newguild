In order to have a functioning guild you must do the following:
Step 1:  type: <mkdir /d/guilds/[guildname]>
Step 2:  move all your files over to that directory.  Your files need 
         to be named like this:
           the hall:  hall.c
           the entrance:  entrance.c
           the treasury:  treasury.c
         If your guild does not meet these specifications the command 
         setupguild will error.
Step 3:  type: <setupguild [guildname]>
Step 4:  If there is any error reported by setupguild start from step 1 again.
Step 5:  type: <call me;set_guild;[guildname]>
Step 6:  type: <goto /d/guilds/[guildname]/treasury.c>
Step 7:  type: <open account>

With this you will have a new guild setup and ready to use.  Make sure you add 
whoever bought the guild to the main array in /include/domains/guild.h
