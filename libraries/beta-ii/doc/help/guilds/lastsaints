In the land of Primal Darkness, there stood the three, the three Last Saints
amoung the land of the dead and the corrupt.  When God himself took them under
his wing, he said to the world, "Never shall innocent blood be shed. Yet the
blood of the wicked shall flow like a river. The three shall spread their
blackened wings and be the vengeaful striking hammer of god."


In this land of darkened times, it is the corrupt we claim, it is the evil we
condemn, it is the damned we slay. We are the good, the mighty, We are The Last
Saints.
