Guilds are run by the players. Each guild is owned by a player through
purchase from an immortal. That player is in full control of the guild, adding
new players, removing them, and purchasing new guild powers. A player may use
any criteria for adding and removing guild members, although each guild does
have restrictions which define membership.
