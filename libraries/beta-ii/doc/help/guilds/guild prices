Guilds are run by the players. Each guild is owned by a player through
purchase from an immortal. That player is in full control of the guild, adding
new players, removing them, and purchasing new guild powers. A player may use
any criteria for adding and removing guild members, although each guild does
have restrictions which define membership.
 
Guilds are meant to provide specialized callings to enhance the
general way you have chosen through your class membership. The class
always remains the player's primary source of power. The guild serves to
create a social environment with a few highly specialized powers. Guilds are
usually very close knit groups.
 
New guilds are 1,500,000 gold.  Each guild will come with a entrance, 
hall, which includes a board, and treasury.  It is best if you decide
the name of the guild and the location of it before applying to the 
guild master.  The first hall must be inside the walls of Tirun.  Additional
halls may be purchased and can be located anywhere on the continent.  New
ideas for guilds is welcome and well appreciated.  For a list of additional
add-ons to guilds see "guild add-ons".
