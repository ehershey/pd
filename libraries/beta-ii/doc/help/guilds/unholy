The unholy are the sworn followers of Asmodeus.  Though he has 
mysteriously vanished, they continue his work as best they can.
The Unholy serve the nether demons loyally and many aspire to
become one themselves.  The location of their hall is mini-quest
info as you may be asked to find it as a prerequisit to joining.
Discipline in the Unholy is strict, any breaking of the established
rules will result in a level of punishment equal to the crime.
The Unholy is a heavy RPing guild.  For this reason, please do 
not pester anyone over any issues you have with them unless a
rule has been broken.
