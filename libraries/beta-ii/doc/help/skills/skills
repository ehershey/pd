 
   The Nightmare mudlib has a system of skills to compliment the system of
stats.  This system follows from the concept that their are certain 
unchanging facts about an individual that come from their racial heritage.
These are the stats so familiar to muds.  You may roll stats, but you still
face the same penalties on each roll based on the race you have chosen.
   Skills are studied and mastered.  Depending on the class you choose, you 
will spend your time studying individual skills to become as good at your 
class as one may become.  Unfortunately, no class is able to master all 
skills.  You master skills by gaining experience and studying the skills or
by using spells and abilities that help you to master the skills involved.
   Primal Darkness has expanded a bit on the Nightmare skill system.  
Skills help determine how good you are at a given thing.  The also play an
important role in spells and abilities determining your chance to hit, 
your chance to be hit, the amount of damage done, and the amount of damage
you take. Not all classes use skills exactly the same. Spells are heavily
skill based in their calculations, while physical abilities are more stat
based in their calculations.
