The martial artists of Primal Darkness, monks believe in the
unity of the body.  They worship their diety who in return
grants their prayers and teaches them of chi.  They strive
for knowledge and understanding of their bodies and the ways
of hand to hand combat.  Monks are known for their goodness 
and faith.
 
The monk hall is rumoured to be in a monastery.
