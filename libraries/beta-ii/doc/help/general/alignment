Your alignment determines how "good" or "evil" you are. Some
subclasses cannot use their spells if their alignment is not
right. Some spells do damage depending on the alignment of 
the target. Changing your alignment is accomplished by killing
something of an opposite alignment that you want to go (ie. 
kill good to become more evil).
 
The alignment ranges are as follows:
 
    Good Alignments                     Evil Alignments
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            Godly                         Mean
          Saintly                         Malevolent
        Righteous        Neutral          Bad
             Good                         Evil
       Benevolent                         Demonic
             Nice                         Satanic
