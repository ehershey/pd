Primal Darkness does not have public displays of level. Levels of players
are not shown to other players. There are other commands to take the place
of level to help determining other information. An example of this is 
partyrange. When you type partyrange it will show you anyone online who
you can party with.
 
Levels represent where you are in the growth of your character. Some spells
and abilities are level based, some quests are level based, etc. As you level
it would be wise to keep your stats and skills up to speed with your level as
some spells or abilities require you to have a set amount of a stat or skill
to be able to get them or use them.
