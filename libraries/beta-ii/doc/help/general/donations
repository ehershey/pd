 
Primal Darkness accepts player donations to help out with the cost 
of hosting. Donating does not give extra status to players and all 
donations are kept in a special account to be used only for hosting. 
If you would like to donate, please goto the mud's website at 
www.primaldarkness.com and click on the donations logo on the 
players page. 
 
Alternately, goto the gear section on the Primal Darkness website
and buy PD Gear. Primal darkness recieves $4 per item sold. PD Gear
consists of shirts, hats, bags, and other items we have put up for 
sale to help support the hosting costs. All items are sold through
a third party called CafePress and are distributed through them.
  
Thank you for interest in Primal Darkness.
