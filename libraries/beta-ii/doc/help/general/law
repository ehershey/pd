    The justice system of Primal Darkness is based off of the idea that
just because you have served your time, does not mean that all is forgiven.
Everyone has their own permanent record, to which you will be held accountable
to every time you are arrested for commiting a crime.  You will only be
arrested when you've recently committed a crime since last serving time.  The
guards in various towns will be searching for outlaws.  So if you've committed
a crime recently, be on your guard.
 
The only two crimes on Primal Darkness are killing another player and stealing
from another player.
