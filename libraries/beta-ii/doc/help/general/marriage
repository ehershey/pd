 
The institution of marriage exists here on Primal Darkness.
 
Marriages are performed by high mortal Clergy. There is a chapel
north of the monastary in Tirun.  The content of the ceremony depends
on the clergy who is performing it.  In order to get married, you
should find a high mortal clergy and ask that person what type of
ceremony he/she performs. Then you should decide on the high mortal
whom you prefer to perform your ceremony, and arrange a time and date.
Feel free to post on the main board the time and date of the marriage.
