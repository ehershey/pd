Coaching is a form of transportation found on the continent of
Bastuul. The coaches travel between the larger cities, and players
can pay for a ticket on any of their current routes. Note that not
all stations actually travel to all locations- some take only
specific routes.

To hop on a coach, simply use:

<coach to [place]>

The length and cost of the journey will depend to where you wish
to travel and the cost is partially dependant on your level.

Coaches can be found in Tirun, Lodos, Roston, and Tenebrae.
