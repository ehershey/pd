Being a newbie on a mud can be intimidating. So, we have come up with the newbie guide and the faq. The newbie guide you should have in your inventory already. You can look at it by typing 'look book' or 'look guide'.

To access the faq, just type 'faq'. If you have any other question that are not covered in these two guides, please use the newbie line and ask. Welcome to Primal Darkness and have fun.
