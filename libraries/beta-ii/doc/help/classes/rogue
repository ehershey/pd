Rogues live on the misery of others, whether it is directly through the
killing of people in a random sort of way, or through stealing and picking
pockets.  These people often become assassins and thieves, and they get
their experience in any way they see fit.  They are not the best of 
fighters nor do they have time to learn the magical arts, but they are
very adept at the arts of deception.  Races with high dexterity make the
best rogues.
