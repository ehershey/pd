The demon worshipers of primal darkness, kataans seek to
spread evil and chaos.  The demons of the underworld answer
their prayers and do their bidding. The kataans are known
for their bitterness and great hatred of all nonbelievers.
 
The kataan hall is rumoured to be in the resting place of
the dead.
