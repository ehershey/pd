            %^CYAN%^The %^YELLOW%^Golden %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Rule

%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^This rule pertains to the Staff of Primal 
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Darkness.  The Staff work very hard and 
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^spend many self-sacrificing hours of their 
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^time to provide and repair content for the
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^game.  One of the most serious offenses in
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^this game is to disrespect a Staff member.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Unless doing so would violate another rule,
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Players are obligated to obey the commands 
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^of Staff members.  If a Player chooses to 
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^disobey a Staff member, then that Player 
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^must disconnect from Primal Darkness until
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^such a time as they can contact one of the 
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Administrators and satisfactorily explain 
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^why they have done so.
