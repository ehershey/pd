This section is intended to provide rules regarding some of the key  issues of gameplay on Primal Darkness, including the proper use of the party system, the delivery system and this world’s policy on scripting and feeding.                                                                                                                                                                   
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.) %^RESET%^Scripting, or the use of a program to perform any sort of task that 
   does not involve input from a Player, is illegal in the context of 
   experience gathering sessions.  It is also illegal for a Character to be 
   active while its Player is away from the computer.  While a Player is 
   away from the computer, his or her Character should be idle.                                                                                                                                
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^b%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ The Delivery system: There are delivery jobs available around the 
   city of Tirun.  For more information, <help delivery>.  This system is 
   intended to be a non-violent method of work for gaining money and 
   experience.  The use of scripting, speed-walk programs, 'gate', 'fly', 
   or any other such form of expedited movement is prohibited.  The penalty
   for violation of this rule is total erasure of financial assets and 
   experience points.                                               
                                                                                               
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^c%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ The particulars of the Party system:                                              
      %^CYAN%^i.)%^RESET%^ 'Feeding' occurs when a member of a party is not making an 
      equitable contribution to the accumulation of experience points.  
      Feeding is illegal.                               
                                                                                                 
      %^CYAN%^ii.)%^RESET%^ When a Party is engaged in an experience gathering session, all 
      Party members must be active participants in the process.  If the 
      function of a particular character within the Party is to heal fellow 
      members rather than to damage opponents, this is acceptable.  However, 
      their physical presence is required.  This means that healers cannot 
      remotely 'm-heal' and must be in the same room or general area as the 
      rest of the party.                              
                                                                                                 
      %^CYAN%^iii.)%^RESET%^ In the formation of a Party, there are restrictions on the 
      addition of Party members.  Party members must all be within a 
      specified level range of the Party Master.  'Bridging' occurs when a 
      Player acts as a medium in the formation of a Party, allowing two Party 
      members who could not normally connect with one another to do so. 
      Bridging becomes illegal if the Party Master leaves the Party and it is 
      not disbanded, because it bypasses the physical restriction intended on 
      Party member connectivity.                                                                                                                           
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^d%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ 'Bugs' are defined here as unforeseen errors in an Immortal's code.  
   The exploitation of Bugs is illegal.  A Bug is usually easy to  identify 
   because it allows some ridiculous or obviously unintentional form of 
   gameplay.  Sometimes these errors are more subtle and it is difficult 
   to determine whether or not they constitute Bugs.  When in doubt, contact 
   a member of the Administration before continuing the activity.  Use the 
   <bug> command to report it.  The following are some examples of Bugs:                                                                                                                         
         -Gaining experience without equitable activity               
                                                                                              
         -Advancing skills, stats or levels without depleting experience points                                                                                                             
         -Fighting a creature that does not fight back                    
                                                                                            
         -Repeatedly using spells or abilities (or 'stacking'
         them, one after the other, without delay) when they 
         were not designed to be used in such a way                                    
         
         -Selling an item over and over for financial gain 
         when it does not leave the inventory                                                                                                                                                   
         -Buying an item at a shop and not being charged for it
