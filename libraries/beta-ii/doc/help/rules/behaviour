These rules have been designed to give an overview of what constitutes acceptable behaviour and what does not.                                                                                                                                       
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ 'Harassment' is defined as the persistent targeting of one          
   Player or group of Players in a negative way, despite the fact
   that the aggressor has been asked to stop.  This type of 
   behaviour is unacceptable on Primal Darkness and may result in 
   various punishments.
                                                                     
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^b%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ 'Spamming' is a specific variation of harassment.  Spamming      
   is defined as the excessive repetition of information over any          
   avenue of communication, i.e. 'say', 'tell', 'shout', boards 
   and lines.  Spamming has no conceivable function other than to 
   annoy the Player population and it is considered to be 
   unacceptable behaviour.                                                                                                                                                                         
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^c%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ The public display of profane language is not allowed.  
   Profane language is allowed in private communications like 'say',
   or 'tell', but only with a consenting audience.                                                 
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^d%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ The discussion of other Multi-User Dimensions is not wanted    
   on Primal Darkness and will be considered illegal.  This rule is 
   in place for the simple reason that Primal Darkness is meant to 
   be a unique, fantasy-oriented experience, and all too often the  
   discussion of other worlds leads to heated comparison and
   sometimes slander. Furthermore, Players are given a blank slate
   when they log on to Primal Darkness for the first time.  Any 
   player  found to be violating the 'blank slate' philosophy noted 
   above will be guilty of violating this rule.                                                                                                                                              
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ The specific behavioural expectations of the Auction line's use:  
                                                                                            
      %^CYAN%^i.)%^RESET%^ Items that have been put up for auction may only be bid on
      once by the Auctioneer in order to set a minimum price.  The 
      Auctioneer must not continually change this minimum price.

      %^CYAN%^ii.)%^RESET%^ Items that are easily identifiable as 'common' -meat, oil
      and stones, for example- are not allowed to be auctioned because 
      they unjustifiably clog up the system, making it more difficult 
      for genuinely rare items to surface.  Common items may only be 
      auctioned in bulk, in containers, so that they represent 
      valuable commodities.
                                                                 
      %^CYAN%^iii.)%^RESET%^ In the event that an Auctioneer fails to sell an item, 
      that item may only be auctioned again after a ten minute waiting
      period has elapsed.  This gives other players the opportunity to
      use the auction system, and prevents spam.                                              
                                                                                               
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^f%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ Respect for members of the Primal Darkness Staff must be shown
   above and beyond the expectations outlined in Rule 1.)a.) regarding
   harassment.  The Staff contribute many self-sacrificing hours of hard 
   work for the enjoyment of the player population and must not be 
   insulted in either explicit OR implicit ways.
