This section is intended to describe the various forms of Player Versus Player behaviour on Primal Darkness and their legal ramifications.                                                                                                                                                  
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ A Player may not kill another specific Player in an obvious series of 
   conflicts.  Such multiple kills are considered a form of harassment.                                                                                                                     
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^b%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ 'PK-Spree' refers to the execution of an unrestrained series of Player
   kills.  PK-Sprees are illegal.
   
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^c%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ A Player must be at least level 20 to participate in or be subjected 
   to combat-oriented Player Versus Player activity.             
                                                                                            
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^d%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ Player killing in a specified 'No Player Versus Player Combat' zone, 
   such as the city of Tirun, is illegal.                                           
   
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ The particulars of Guild Player Versus Player activity:  
                    
      %^CYAN%^i.)%^RESET%^ A Guild and all of its members are permitted to kill a specific 
      member of another Guild exactly one time, until a five day period of 
      wait has elapsed.  After this delay, conflict may legally be resumed.  
      Violation of this rule is considered harassment and is illegal.
      Consider the killed Character to be a Chess piece that has been 
      temporarily removed from the board.  However, if an Outlaw is killed
      in guild versus guild conflict, then that kill does not apply to this
      particular rule and will not be counted.            
                                                                                             
      %^CYAN%^ii.)%^RESET%^ Similarly to IV.)d.)i.), a Character who has been killed by 
      another Guild is barred from initiating combat with any member of that 
      Guild until the five day period of wait has passed.  Consider the 
      killed Character to be a Chess piece that has been temporarily removed 
      from the board.  However, if an Outlaw is killed in guild versus guild 
      conflict, then that kill does not apply to this particular rule and 
      will not be counted.                                                                      
                                                                                              
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^f%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ The particulars of kill ownership:                                            
      %^CYAN%^i.)%^RESET%^ In certain cases, a Player may be engaged in combat with a 
      creature, or resting one room away from its location.  In these cases, 
      except as indicated in special game-wide events, that creature is their 
      property to kill unless they explicitly relinquish their claim on it.
      Attacking a creature that has been claimed in said fashion is illegal 
      unless it is done by a Party member of the creature's owner.                                                                                                               
      %^CYAN%^ii.)%^RESET%^ If a creature is injured and there is no other character present 
      to claim the right to kill it, then a Player attacks it at their own 
      risk of being charged with stealing the kill.                                                                                                                                           
      %^CYAN%^iii.)%^RESET%^ The principles of ownership in Rules IV.)e.) and f.) apply to 
      the looting of corpses as well.
