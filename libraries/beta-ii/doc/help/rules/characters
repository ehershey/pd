These rules address several common issues with regard to character creation and customization, as well as the importance of character ownership.                                                                                                                                                
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.) %^RESET%^As Primal Darkness is a game with an emphasis on a fantasy-oriented
   gaming experience, new Characters are required to choose names that are 
   suitable for such an environment.  A fairly safe guideline for choosing
   a name is to exclude the use of actual words.  This rule is probably
   the most flexible of all, but can be arbitrarily enforced at the 
   discretion of the administration.  No justification is necessary.

   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^b%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ All information published by Players must be respectful and void of
   any offensive content.  Offensive content includes (but is not limited 
   to) references to illegal activities, racial remarks, discussion of lewd 
   behaviour, etc.                                                      
                                                                                   
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^c%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.)%^RESET%^ Enter and Exit messages are customizable by players after they have 
   reached level 20.  These messages are a special privilege and a luxury 
   intended to promote character creativity through customization.  Enter
   and Exit messages must include a perfectly clear indication of the 
   direction that their respective characters have followed.  If the 
   direction that a character has followed is hidden or confused in the 
   customized messages, they are said to be  guilty of 'Stealthing' their 
   entrances and exits.  Please note that 'Stealthing' and the ability 
   'stealth' are completely different.              
                                                                                            
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^d%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.) %^RESET%^The particulars of Character ownership:                                       
      %^CYAN%^i.)%^RESET%^ A Player may own any number of Characters but no Character may be 
      used or owned by more than one Player.  The sharing of Characters is 
      illegal.                    
                                                                                             
      %^CYAN%^ii.)%^RESET%^ A Player may only be logged on to the game with one Character at
      a time.  If a player is logged on with more than one Character 
      simultaneously, he or she is said to be guilty of 'Multi-Playing'.  
      None of a Player's Characters are permitted to interact with each 
      other or benefit from each other's activities.  That means that it is 
      illegal for a Character to directly or indirectly affect an alternate 
      Character belonging to the same Player.        
                                                                                            
   %^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.) %^RESET%^LANs: If you are connecting from a LAN-based  computer with  more than 
   one Player connected to the game, you will need to contact an Administrator
   and make a request for an allowance to do so.  Multiple Players from the 
   same IP must apply in this manner in order to clear up any confusing issues 
   with regard to Multi-Playing.  Failure to apply is illegal.                                                                                                                                                  
   Please note the following particulars:                                                
      %^CYAN%^i.)%^RESET%^ Players on the same LAN are not allowed to exchange money or items.  

      %^CYAN%^ii.)%^RESET%^ Players on the same LAN may party together with the same rules 
      described in III.)c.) in effect.                    
                                                                                             
      %^CYAN%^iii.)%^RESET%^ Player killing while on a LAN is forbidden.  The punishment for 
      violation of any LAN rule is an instant Character deletion and possible 
      banishment of the entire LAN's IP.
