Quests are mysterious journeys undertaken by Players in order to achieve some desired reward.  The most prestigious races are available only through the completion of Quests.  On Primal Darkness, the secrecy of the information needed to solve any given  Quest is incredibly valuable to the health of the Multi-User Dimension.  Rewards can only justifiably be made as valuable as they are rare.  In the future, it may be necessary for the Administration to devalue rewards based on their decreasing rarity  for the sake of Balance.  The following rules have been designed to  help ensure that Quest rewards will remain worthwhile:
