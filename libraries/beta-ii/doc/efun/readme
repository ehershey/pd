The documentation in this directory is simply the ascii man pages
for MudOS 0.9.19 efuns which ship with the driver.  They are
setup within the Nightmare mudlib 3.2 to be accessible through a
"man" command.  In addition, SimulEfun, lfun, and apply information
may be accessed through the man command.

Credits for the documentation of the efuns in this directory may be
found in the file /doc/etc/Credits.DriverDocs
