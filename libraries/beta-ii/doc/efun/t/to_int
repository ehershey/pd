to_int(3)              C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS              to_int(3)

NAME
     to_int - convert a float or buffer to an int

SYNOPSIS
     int to_int(float|buffer x);

DESCRIPTION
     If `x' is a float, the to_int() call returns the  number  of
     type  `int'  that  is  equivalent  to  `x' (with any decimal
     stripped off).  If `x' is a buffer,  the  call  returns  the
     integer  (in  network-byte-order)  that  is  embedded in the
     buffer.

SEE ALSO
     to_float(3), read_buffer(3)
