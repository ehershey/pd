NAME
     geteuid() - return the effective user id  of  an  object  or
     function

SYNOPSIS
     string geteuid(object|function);

DESCRIPTION
     If given an object argument, geteuid returns  the  effective
     user  id (euid) of the object.  If given an argument of type
     'function', it returns the euid of the object  that  created
     that 'function' variable.  If the object, at the time of the
     function variable's construction, had no euid, the  object's
     uid is stored instead.
