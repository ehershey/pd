catch(3)               C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS               catch(3)

NAME
     catch() - catch an evaluation error

SYNOPSIS
     mixed catch( mixed expr );

DESCRIPTION
     Evaluate <expr>. If there is no error,  0  is  returned.  If
     there  is  a  standard  error, a string (with a leading '*')
     will be returned.

     The function throw() can also be used to immediately  return
     any  value, except 0. catch() is not really a function call,
     but a directive to the compiler.

     The catch() is somewhat costly, and should not be used  just
     anywhere.   Rather,  use  it  at places where an error would
     destroy consistency.

SEE ALSO
     error(3), throw(3)
