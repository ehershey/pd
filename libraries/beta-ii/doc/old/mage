%^RESET%^Mages have devoted their lives to learning magic.  They have no powers of
%^RESET%^faith, and their time spent learning magic takes away from any time they
%^RESET%^might have spent learning fighting skills.  They are very capable of
%^RESET%^learning, however, offensive type spells and spells of a conjuring nature.     
%^RESET%^They are generally not tremendously pious nor are they terribly wicked.
%^RESET%^Mages must, however, be fairly intelligent and wise.

%^RESET%^             and suffering to their enemies.
