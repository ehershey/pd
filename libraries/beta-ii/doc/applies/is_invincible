int is_invincible() {

    ((( code goes here )))
    return #;
}

This func is automatically called whenever someone attacks the monster that contains it.

return 1;  << Runs the function and then ends combat.
               Your monster is un-attackable this way.

return 0;  << Runs the function and then lets combat commence.

%^RED%^%^BOLD%^NOTICE%^RESET%^ --- query_attackers() and query_current_attacker() are NOT defined until this function has run its course. However, this_player() points to the player that is attempting the attack while is_invincible() is running :)
