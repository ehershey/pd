This directory contains documentation on driver applies.
An apply is a function in an object which exists to be called
by the driver.  When reading about an apply, keep in mind that
not all applies are used for all objects.  In particular, keep
in mind that there is a special subset of applies called master applies
which are functions existing solely in the master object to be
called by the driver.  If the functions exist in other objects, they are
treated as normal functions.
In order to work with the "man" command, all applies are kept in 
sub-directories based on the first letter in their name.  Excepting, of
course, the apply __INIT().

See the credits documentation in /doc/etc for information on the authors
of these documents.
