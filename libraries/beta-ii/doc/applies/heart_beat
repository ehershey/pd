set_heart_beat( # ); 

int heart_beat() {

     (((( Code Goes here ))))

     return 1;
}


The set_heart_beat() controls wheather the func is turned on or off and normally is called in the create() section.

This func is called everytime the mud calls for heart_beat()... aka every 2 sec or so...

As a result, anything you code into this func() will happen over and over every few seconds until you set_heart_beat(0);
