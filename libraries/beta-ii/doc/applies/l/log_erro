NAME
     log_error - log errors intelligently

SYNOPSIS
     void log_error(string file, string message)

DESCRIPTION
     Whenever an error occurs during  compilation,  the  function
     log_error  in  the master object is called with the filename
     that the error occurred in and  the  error  message  itself.
     Then,  log_error  is free to do whatever it thinks it should
     do with that information.  Usually this is deciding based on
     the  filename  where the error message should be logged, and
     then writing it to that file.
