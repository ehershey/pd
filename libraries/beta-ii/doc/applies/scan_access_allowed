This is a programmable function that is checked with the
Simul_efun called security_screen(). If you program it into
your workroom.c, then only archwizards and the builders
listed may gather certain information about your objects.

EXAMPLE ==

string *access_allowed() {return ({"larry","moe","curley"}); }

%^YELLOW%^OR%^RESET%^

string *access_allowed() {
     string *guests=({});

      guests=({"larry","moe","curley"});
      return guests; }

In both cases, the function will lock access to all builders
except for "larry", "moe", "curley", and archwizards.

%^RED%^%^BOLD%^NOTICE%^RESET%^ -- Not having this function present in your workroom.c will allow all other builders access to your objects information using certain commands. The help files on those commands will tell you if this function is used for security or not.");
