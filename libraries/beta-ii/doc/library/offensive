This was written to define for the purposes of Primal Darkness,
what is a legally and illegally offensive act. As was once stated
by Descartes of Borg, "Please understand that we have no sympathy 
for the hypersensitive here. For instance, if I state beliefs about
God which might run contrary to your beliefs, you may be offended,
but (Primal Darkness) does not consider my statements offensive."

Making fun of another's physical traits is not allowed.
Examples (not comprehensive) of physical traits:
   gender, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental handicaps

Use of profanity is partially allowed, as long as nobody that would
be offended by it's use can see it. See the book on profanity in the
Tirunian library.

Punishment for being offensive is completely up to the administrators
at the moment.
