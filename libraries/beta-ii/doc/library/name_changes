These are legal, however they are very very very very
very very very very very annoying to do. We hate doing

Unless there's a really really good reason name change
requests probably won't be done. In order to have your
name changed, mail Inferno with your request and reason.
Please note: Changing your name by starting over is fine.

Questions to Inferno.
