Unlike most muds, Pd-2 does not require a player to reach a specific level in
order to obtain the right to create an area and still maintain your player
character.

To become immortal:
1) You mail the advocate asking for the privelidge to code Primal Darkness.
2) If the circumstances are right (we are not filled with newbie
immortals, you have not been in trouble with law, we feel that you will not
interfere with other creators, etc.) you will be given an immortal character
on our Pd-Builders port.
3) You code your area, and upon completion get it approved by an administrator.
Once approved, your area will be moved into Pd-2.
