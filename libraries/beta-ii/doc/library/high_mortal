High mortals have their own set of commands, which include such abilities
as limited teleport, setting their title, setting their login place, and
so on. But the concept of high mortal is meant to be something more than
being able to kill more monsters and have more commands to use. It is
about trying to create a goal in this game for people who are not in
the least bit interested in learning to code, or in coding itself, yet
what to make a more in depth contribution to this game other than
slaying the most powerful monsters. High mortal is a player rank, better
than both newbie and mortal, but not quite as high as elite or hero/heroine.
