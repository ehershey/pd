The highest levels of mud functioning aredivided into 4 positions.
On Primal Darkness, there are no levels for immortals as there are for
players. Instead, responsibilities are dictated by your position.
We have the following positions:

head arch
arch
creator

Each position carries the following responsibilities:
---------------------------------------------------------
Head Arch/Game Master:
  This is Seeker. At the end of everything, his decision is final.
  He simply isn't responsible ;)

Administrator/Arch:
  The highest attainable rank, below Head Arch, Archs are responsible
  for running and maintaining the game. They enforce rules of the realm.

Law:
  Law is here to make sure that none of the Creators are cheating and to
  keep them in line if something should happen when no arch is available.

Creator:
  A creator is an immortal either on Pd or on Pd-Builders, this person
  is responsible for adding an area to the game.
