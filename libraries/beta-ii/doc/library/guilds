Guilds are run by the players. Each guild is owned by a player through
purchase from an immortal. That player is in full control of the guild, adding
new players, removing them, and purchasing new guild powers. A player may use
any criteria for adding and removing guild members, although each guild does
have restrictions which define membership.

Guilds are meant to provide specialized callings to enhance the
general way you have chosen through your class membership. The class
always remains the player's primary source of power. The guild serves to
create a social environment with a few highly specialized powers. Guilds are
usually very close knit groups.

Guilds are formed by players on the PD-Builders port or the head Guild Master 
may code them.  The prices are as follows:
A new Guild:  300,000 Gold
Extra Guild hall:  150,000 Gold
Extra room:  50,000 Gold
Shop:  100,000 Gold
Lockers:  100,000 Gold
Praying Room:  75,000 Gold
Guards:  10,000 gold to put in.  5,000 gold per month.

If your guild has guards i will take out the dues each month.  Failure
to have the money to pay the dues will result in removal of your guards.

Every new guild comes with a hall, entrance, and plain room.  It is best if 
you decide what you want the name to be and where you would like to put the 
hall.  The first hall must be located inside Tirun.  After that any 
additional halls may be located anywhere on the continent.  Please see Whit
for more information or if you would like to buy a guild.
