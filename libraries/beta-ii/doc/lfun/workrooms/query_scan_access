SYNTAX :: query_scan_access(string target);

       that person is present in the room's scan level of access. A 0
       means either they are not or the array is empty.
    2) If no args are passed then an array of names is returned.
       A 0 is returned if the array was empty.

   if a person has a particular level of access or not.
