NAME :: set_blocked_dirs

SYNTAX :: set_blocked_dirs(string *targets);

This funtion allows you to lock out whole folders and or single files.
It is perfered that you type in the whole path to the file/dir you wish
blocked but is not required.

The way this works is the system will check the strings you give this
function to see if ANY of them are contained in the file_name+path of
the file the person is trying to look at. If ANY of them are anyplace
in the targeted path and/or path to file, all access will be negative.
You may also place filenames in this function.

EXAMPLES ::

     set_blocked_dirs( ({ "/wizards/ironman/atlantis" }) );

This would lockout all files contained in this folder to anyone I have
otherwise granted a level of access.

     set_blocked_dirs( ({ "level1" }) );

This would block out any and all files and/or directories called "level1"
contained in my directories.

     set_blocked_dirs( ({ "hamster.c" }) );

This would block out the files called "hamster.c"

Be careful with this function, If you pass it something stupid like "a"
then every file or directory with "a" contained in the directory or
filenames will be screened out too :P
