int security_screen(object);

This Simulefun takes in any object and checks to see if this_player()
is listed in the Author's workroom.c function called access_allowed().

A 1 is returned if the function is NOT in their workroom.c or they
are granted access by the Wizard who own's the file.

The archwizards and administrators can see the files regardless.
This Simulefun affects wizard to wizard files.
