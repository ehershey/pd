NAME :: security_screen_read

SYNTAX :: security_screen_read(mixed target,object guest);

This sfun tests to see if the "guest" object has access to the "target".
The "target" may be an object or the filename of an object. A 1 is returned
for yes. A 0 is returned for no.

This s-fun is used to test the arrays from the WORKROOM inherit.

----NOTE-----

Read access allows a builder to read the file but not write or overwrite it.

A person with read access will also test + for guest and scan access.
