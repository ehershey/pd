NAME :: security_screen_write

SYNTAX :: security_screen_write(mixed target,object guest);

This sfun tests to see if the "guest" object has access to the "target".
The "target" may be an object or the filename of an object. A 1 is returned
for yes. A 0 is returned for no.

This s-fun is used to test the arrays from the WORKROOM inherit.

----NOTE-----

Write access allows total access to the builders files......
Be VERY selective as to whom you entrust this power..........

If the person has write access, they will test + for read, scan and guest access.
