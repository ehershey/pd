SYNTAX :: test_array( mixed income, string* paths );

This sfun will take in a string or object. (If it is an object,
the file_name of that object is tested. ) It will then test to see
if the string is contained within any of the members of the array
passed in "paths". If any of the members of "paths" contains the
string in "income" (or the file_name for the object), a 1 will be
returned.

As of this point, this sfun is only on the builders port.
