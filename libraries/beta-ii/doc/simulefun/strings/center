string center( string , int );

This Simulefun will take in a string and return a string that has
been centered according to this_player()->getenv("SCREEN"). In the
event that the player has not defined the screenwidth, the default
value will be 80. The int is an optional value that you can pass 
center(). If you do, the width of the returned string will be set to
that value and not the player's getenv("SCREEN")
