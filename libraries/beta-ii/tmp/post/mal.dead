You tell Mal: you might want to hear an explanation of your new punishment
You tell Mal: if you leave the square, you will decay
You tell Mal: if you try to talk, you will decay
You tell Mal: you are free to do either of these things though
You tell Mal: after 5 days of playing time I will remove this curse from you
You tell Mal: that's playing time, as in being logged on
