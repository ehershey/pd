Checking the help guild_list notes that Unholy no longer has an owner...And i guess i should at least make an attempt to get the information across...

Ok...Furion is still technically the owner of Unholy now, since Leviathas leaving...However due to his inactive nature i have been made temporary owner, until the time of his return if he wants ownership back.  That has been the stipulation put on me at the time being at least.

Don't know if you were aware of this already or not, but thought it couldnt hurt just in case.
(And if this is completely out of the blue..I just rechecked the meeting board since i became active again)
