Havent been on for awhile, anyway i didnt give eios permission to take owner ship from me, he was just joking, the bastard.

Anyway, can i get it back? Even though i dont play anymore, its still my guild :P and eios can not be a higher rank then me!
Im fine with keeping him leader with Endbringer, but im the real owner, cheers :P
