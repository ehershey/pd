I hear you coded Psiblades? great idea dude but due it being bugged or something its been downgraded to the point where i use it for the pritty colours and not for helping me xp. It does a max of like 20 damage a round, Thats not balanced at all for my lvl/skills. I was wondering if you could make it usable again becuase its a cool spell. Get back to me if you could. Cheers               Ithilgore
