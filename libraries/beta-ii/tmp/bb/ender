Shockwave

The sorceror would focus their powers into a strong mental blast of psionic energy. The spell could either be used on a group of mobs, or a single one. Vs the single mob it would be more powerful (duh) and vs a room of mobs (ie: shockwave all) it would do about 3/4 the dmg as vs a single mob at 1.5x the cost.

The spell would use mostly psionics with some magic attack in it for dmg. And cost 30 mana or so.
