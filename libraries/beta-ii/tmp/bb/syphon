Joe: One more thing, while I'm gone work on toys and stuff in your home directory (mabye make a new sub-directory) and try not to make any more cave rooms until i'm back, I have to talk to you about those

Oh, and if you decide to make more rooms, when you copy one room1 to room2, **change the description of room2** I had to go through and make all the descriptions in your cave =P and try some mob variation - i added female and male spiders in addition to the guardian you had

Otherwise, grats on your first piece of work on the mud =)
When I get back on sunday I'll transfer them all over to /d/standard/ so they'll be permanantly in sindarii =)
