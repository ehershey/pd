One thing i noticed with this mud is the OVER use of colors, yea its nice to have a color on some items and such but what makes colors special when EVERYTHING is colored. The areas in this mud ESPECIALLy the newbies areas are intolerable, how is a newbie suposed to find the hall in this town thats ginormous

Tsk i blame the builders and admin.
