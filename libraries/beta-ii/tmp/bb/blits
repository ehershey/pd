Only a slight problem I thought I should post. I am very fond of the partying system in this game. The problem I am having is after the first time I rage I've killed my charging companions horse/deer that he was previously mounting, seriously hindring our further adventuring. Just wondering if anything will be done about this? or whether I hold back on raging (or he gets a lot more horses)
