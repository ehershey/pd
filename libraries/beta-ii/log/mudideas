/d/guilds/ethereal/hall: I think most of the players on PD are pretty confused on what order the whole protection of armour thing goes.. I mean how am I supposed to know hardly armoured is better than lightly protected? Lightly protected sounds better than hardly armoured, yet hardly armoured is it. I think a good idea would be a help file..or an addition to an existing help file (like help armour) that tells you which is better than what. A player shouldn't have to go around asking people on the mud to find out if the armour they're wearing is worth wearing over something else. Thanks :)
Idea reported by Kumi Tue Mar  2 10:01:23 2004
/d/guilds/ethereal/hall: I think a nice idea would be to have some stables somewhere on PD where players can purchase animals for themselves to ride. It shouldn't autoload, but if they take their animal back to the stable, they can "store" it there until after reboot. One animal only though, just as the locker system is set up. It would be cool if there were horses, unicorns, zebras..etc...Maybe even baby dragons or something silly like that. The animals shouldn't have a heartbeat or anything like that. I would love something like this, and maybe this can be financially good for something, like you could set it up to donate the money it makes to something..I dunno. Think about it, thanks :)

/d/freepk/rhondale/rooms/zforest/x8y31: Revise the party system to encourage cooperative play. A good system i've seen is, the amount of exp of a mob acquired after a kill is evaluated by a multiplier depending on the amount of members in a party. Currently that's probably what pd has. But the multipliers are a bit lower and needs adjusting to make more people party to exp.

/d/nopk/tirun/clergy_hall: rather than have ointments which take several rounds to use to heal after every single mob, why not modify our food and drink system to heal sp quickly if your hunger and quenched status are within the right range (about 3/4 full) and a bit slower sp heal the farther outside the range you are, this way you still have to take time to eat/drink but you won't be spending as much time healing as you did killing the mob - magic types just have to rub stone once in a while, this would be similar - and if this is implemented ointment sp heal could be nerfed down to a token amount like 15
