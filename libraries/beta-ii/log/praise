/d/sewers/rooms/2lv17: I just wanna praise this mud as a new player, love the idea of quest races it is something to achieve for. A lot needs to be fixed but I feel there are active immortals working a lot and seeing some new improvements over days all the time. This place is vital and hope it will be so. At a later stage it might be adviceable to try to actively recruit more coders so the development of the game will continue beautifully like a small creek turning into a stream which in turn turns into a lake. Love the mud thanks for the good work.
