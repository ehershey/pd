[Sep 7-06 10:0:27]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I would but there isnt anything appealing in the house.  I tried forcing myself to eat scrambled eggs a few hours ago.
[Sep 7-06 10:0:39]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ Thinking about chugging down some juice.
[Sep 7-06 10:0:50]Leeroy %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ hmm, nothing good canned or frozen?
[Sep 7-06 10:2:25]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ grilled cheese sandwitch is always a good call
[Sep 7-06 10:2:37]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ That's a good idea.
[Sep 7-06 10:2:43]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ Thanks.
[Sep 7-06 10:3:1]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ np ;)  It is the snack of champions
[Sep 7-06 10:3:25]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I wont mind using white bread because of all the butter >:)
[Sep 7-06 10:3:33]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ why I havent eaten a sandwich
[Sep 7-06 10:4:27]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ Thankfully I get paid today.
[Sep 7-06 10:5:47]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I actually get the texas toast bread for mine ;)
[Sep 7-06 10:6:25]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ gives it more of that wheaty beefiness without the odd wheat flavor that just doesnt go well with the cheese
[Sep 7-06 10:6:43]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I use sandwich wheat
[Sep 7-06 10:6:55]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ it tastes good with tons of butter
[Sep 7-06 10:7:29]Zub %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ texas toast used for french toast pwns
[Sep 7-06 10:7:53]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I like texas toast, I make garlic bread with it
[Sep 7-06 10:8:9]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ great for sopping pasta sauce
[Sep 7-06 10:12:17]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ yeah, wheat is usually preferable, but it doesnt work for grilled cheese, at least for me
[Sep 7-06 10:13:17]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ Use to I wouldnt eat it, but as I have gotten older white seems doey.
[Sep 7-06 10:14:1]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ My tastes on a few things have changed over the years.
[Sep 7-06 10:14:19]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ My parents always said they would, but Ive always had to learn things for myself.
[Sep 7-06 10:14:43]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ yeah, I changed to wheat about 2 years ago
[Sep 7-06 10:15:31]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I tried wheat pasta...it was alright, it I used alot of sauce.
[Sep 7-06 10:15:45]Leeroy %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I love wheat pasta
[Sep 7-06 10:15:53]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ wheat pasta is gross :P
[Sep 7-06 10:16:10]Leeroy %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ but I also love bean curd
[Sep 7-06 10:16:11]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ It's alright with alot fo sauce.  I think it maybe an acquired taste.
[Sep 7-06 10:16:17]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ wheat is more for the texture than the taste
[Sep 7-06 10:16:41]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ and I can get good fettuchini or linguini to make up for it
[Sep 7-06 10:18:11]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ Did you get bored with being a creator?
[Sep 7-06 10:20:45]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ not especially, I still create in my free time

[Sep 7-06 10:20:59]%^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ Hamoto nods.
[Sep 7-06 10:21:25]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I find myself still designing areas, but I don't have the patience to sit and write them out in code any more.
[Sep 7-06 10:21:53]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ I've kicked around the idea of re-writing a code generator I made a while back
[Sep 7-06 10:22:8]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ input descriptions and whatnot, and it creates the code
[Sep 7-06 10:22:15]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ A friend of mine made one.
[Sep 7-06 10:22:25]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ My areas are too complex for a generator though
[Sep 7-06 10:23:7]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ *nod* most custom stuff has to be hand done, but it's good for people that are creative but dont know how to code
[Sep 7-06 10:23:43]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ My friend is trying to create a newer version with drop down menus that will create more advanced functions.
[Sep 7-06 10:24:1]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ Descriptions and the concepts are easy
[Sep 7-06 10:24:21]Nightshade %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ *nods* I lost the source to my old one so if I do I'll have to start over >.<
[Sep 7-06 10:24:23]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ but some of the stuff I come up with are functions beyond my current skills
[Sep 7-06 11:4:10]Hamoto %^MAGENTA%^<gossip>%^RESET%^ Im gonna hate seeing this cool spell disappear.  It's been nice with these breezy 80 degree days.

[Mar 29-08 16:5:18]Skrymer <gossip> one touch of it, and it frags you
[Mar 29-08 16:5:34]Rommel <gossip> u should code it into a skrymer special move
[Mar 29-08 16:5:34]Skrymer <gossip> then you gotta get a disk defragmenter to fix yourself
[Mar 29-08 16:5:46]Skrymer <gossip> but your fragged! so you cant move

[Mar 29-08 16:14:30]Rommel <gossip> lol
[Mar 29-08 16:14:36]Rommel <gossip> who stun u
[Mar 29-08 16:14:52]Cyan <gossip> no one right now
[Mar 29-08 16:15:20]Cyan <gossip> just saying I think all of them are dumb
[Mar 29-08 16:15:45]Rommel <gossip> speak of the devil
[Mar 29-08 16:16:35]Cyan <gossip> is there a resistance to them Nul? like they last less rounds if the person being affected has higher wis or int than someone else?
[Mar 29-08 16:17:1]Cyan <gossip> or is it, if they get past resistance.. your stuck for 3-4 rounds
[Mar 29-08 16:17:13]Nulvect <gossip> every move is different
[Mar 29-08 16:17:34]Sparticus <gossip> the only one i see theres no way out of is the spell demonfire
[Mar 29-08 16:17:44]Sparticus <gossip> other than that all of them have their own way of getting out of it
[Mar 29-08 16:18:44]Cyan <gossip> haven't really seen many stuns on PD until recently too
[Mar 29-08 16:18:58]Cyan <gossip> if they had them, I didn't see them used much.. the first Ive seen used the most, was when druids were redone
[Mar 29-08 16:19:16]Nulvect <gossip> they were always around, just usually very bad
[Mar 29-08 16:20:2]Cyan <gossip> besides playing a video game, this is the first mud with immobilization moves that didn't become nill when you attacked them
[Mar 29-08 16:20:50]Monk <gossip> meaning?
[Mar 29-08 16:21:0]Nulvect <gossip> uh... you mean it wears off when you attack the person you just paralyzed??
[Mar 29-08 16:21:18]Cyan <gossip> yes.. but only for non abusive purposes
[Mar 29-08 16:21:22]Sparticus <gossip> k i lost cyan there he used big words
[Mar 29-08 16:21:26]Cyan <gossip> they had moves that could stun your for up to 12 ticks
[Mar 29-08 16:22:50]Cyan <gossip> and being able to constrict someone's moves with your mind, and being able to cast a different spell, or perform a different move at same time, IVe rarely seen
[Mar 29-08 16:23:20]Nulvect <gossip> I take it you're referring to the sorc spell
[Mar 29-08 16:23:30]Sparticus <gossip> cyan if your mad about tia :p she got like 200 wisdom man
[Mar 29-08 16:23:32]Cyan <gossip> and druid spell
[Mar 29-08 16:23:48]Cyan <gossip> I dont care about tia, it wasn't my first time fighting her, she beat me without the stun
[Mar 29-08 16:23:58]Sparticus <gossip> ahh k
[Mar 29-08 16:24:12]Nulvect <gossip> druid spell is not constricting someone with your mind, you make roots grow around them
[Mar 29-08 16:25:16]Cyan <gossip> ok, I'll give druids then.. since it's a moving, plant.. I suppose
[Mar 29-08 16:25:34]Sparticus <gossip> cyan you resent us magic users eh :(
[Mar 29-08 16:25:58]Cyan <gossip> I dont resent any class..
[Mar 29-08 16:26:0]Sparticus <gossip> considering im the only friggin one on :P
[Mar 29-08 16:26:12]Nulvect <gossip> there are only two completely basic paralyze moves, and both are for classes which are not meant to be major damage dealers
[Mar 29-08 16:26:20]Cyan <gossip> dude, my char was married to a necro :P
[Mar 29-08 16:26:38]Sparticus <gossip> hrm :P
[Mar 29-08 16:26:46]Sparticus <gossip> then it must have been cyber sex :P
[Mar 29-08 16:26:48]Cyan <gossip> a sorc is not a dmg dealer?
[Mar 29-08 16:26:58]Sparticus <gossip> lol a sorc is a support class :P
[Mar 29-08 16:27:6]Rommel <gossip> well according to the scroll ur techincally still married lol
[Mar 29-08 16:27:10]Nulvect <gossip> that spell is not a full paralyze
[Mar 29-08 16:27:24]Sparticus <gossip> you can still do jumping jacks while mindshocked
[Mar 29-08 16:27:30]Cyan <gossip> lol
[Mar 29-08 16:27:38]Cyan <gossip> melee *Dance*
[Mar 29-08 16:27:40]Sparticus <gossip> lol
[Mar 29-08 16:28:2]Rommel <gossip> i thought it was full paralyze lol
[Mar 29-08 16:28:10]Nulvect <gossip> nope
[Mar 29-08 16:28:12]Cyan <gossip> do assassins or thugs get immobolizing move?
[Mar 29-08 16:28:16]Rommel <gossip> i was para even after i lost lol
[Mar 29-08 16:28:22]Nulvect <gossip> sort of
[Mar 29-08 16:28:26]Cyan <gossip> you cant do anything but melee rommel, so he says that don't count
[Mar 29-08 16:28:44]Cyan <gossip> because you can atleast watch your auto do something
[Mar 29-08 16:28:48]Sparticus <gossip> lol im surprised a mage actually kicked someones butt =/
[Mar 29-08 16:28:58]Ki <gossip> thieves get a sweet immobilizer
[Mar 29-08 16:29:4]Sparticus <gossip> usually i get my hide handed to me in a separate bucket

[Mar 29-08 16:29:38]Ki <gossip> pin. :)
[Mar 29-08 16:29:38]Cyan <gossip> so you cant do anything?
[Mar 29-08 16:29:46]Cyan <gossip> because someone stabbed your foot?
[Mar 29-08 16:29:48]Sparticus <gossip> omg zub is on quick idle
[Mar 29-08 16:29:56]Ki <gossip> u can fight back, just cant runz
[Mar 29-08 16:29:58]Cyan <gossip> and amusingly.. thats the main class IW oudl think to have a stun
[Mar 29-08 16:30:16]Sparticus <gossip> a clean one :D
[Mar 29-08 16:30:24]Sparticus <gossip> unused = way to be
[Mar 29-08 16:30:26]Cyan <gossip> cherry flavored? lol
[Mar 29-08 16:30:34]Ki <gossip> I wish I had it. I'd stab someone in the foot, then go next room and shoot arrows!
[Mar 29-08 16:30:38]Rommel <gossip> i think cyan should get a para move
[Mar 29-08 16:30:44]Cyan <gossip> no way
[Mar 29-08 16:30:50]Cyan <gossip> it don't make sense, lol
[Mar 29-08 16:31:6]Cyan <gossip> this is WoW where a hammer will fall on them, and Iruin away bubbling
[Mar 29-08 16:31:24]Nulvect <gossip> I wouldn't be against a limited one, for say, really evil targets, or undead only or something
[Mar 29-08 16:31:30]Cyan <gossip> lol
[Mar 29-08 16:31:30]Sparticus <gossip> nah this is diablo II where you grab your shield and stun your opponent with it
[Mar 29-08 16:31:44]Rommel <gossip> it would read
[Mar 29-08 16:31:50]Cyan <gossip> I dont want a stun, I probably wouldn't use it unless to stop a pk
[Mar 29-08 16:31:50]Sparticus <gossip> surprisingly its called smite :P
[Mar 29-08 16:31:58]Ki <gossip> oooo. <angelheart> paralyzes a monster with the angel's beauty...menawhile 'Take My Breath Away' from Top Gun plays inna background

[Mar 29-08 16:33:0]Ki <gossip> *idea

[Mar 29-08 16:33:18]Nulvect <gossip> I try to keep paralyze moves pretty restricted
[Mar 29-08 16:33:24]Cyan <gossip> that why any tool can be a necromancer on WoW
[Mar 29-08 16:33:30]Ki <gossip> prolly, but it's non-para!
[Mar 29-08 16:33:42]Sparticus <gossip> necromancers, what a douche class
[Mar 29-08 16:33:44]Nulvect <gossip> it's so touchy though

[Mar 29-08 16:34:58]Ki <gossip> <channel> A berserker takes a round to focus his strength on the upcoming attack, making it more potent than it would have been otherwise! Chicka-pow! Sparklez! Sparklez!

[Mar 29-08 16:36:26]<gossip> Ki slashes for an extra 3 damage!!!
[Mar 29-08 16:36:40]Sparticus <gossip> my remote dont do that :(
[Mar 29-08 16:36:42]Nulvect <gossip> the idea is not bad, ki, but berserkers don't 'take a moment to focus'
[Mar 29-08 16:36:46]<gossip> Ki borders on teh awesome.
[Mar 29-08 16:37:0]Rommel <gossip> anti's take a moment to focus
[Mar 29-08 16:37:2]Ki <gossip> even a high level one that gets kinda smartified?
[Mar 29-08 16:37:2]Cyan <gossip> Im still trying to figure out the time to use my new abil
[Mar 29-08 16:37:10]Nulvect <gossip> berserkers 'go bat-uh..guano insane'
[Mar 29-08 16:37:12]Cyan <gossip> smartified, nice

[Mar 29-08 16:37:46]Ki <gossip> lol
[Mar 29-08 16:37:46]<gossip> Cyan cries, doesn't want to sparkle
[Mar 29-08 16:37:46]Nulvect <gossip> actually it sounds like a good move for monks
[Mar 29-08 16:37:56]Sparticus <gossip> NO!
[Mar 29-08 16:37:56]<gossip> Cyan would've made his char a fairy if he wanted sparkles
[Mar 29-08 16:37:56]Ki <gossip> yeah, they need it.
[Mar 29-08 16:38:6]Sparticus <gossip> monks need pimphand :(
[Mar 29-08 16:38:8]Rommel <gossip> boooooo monks got too many moves
[Mar 29-08 16:38:20]<gossip> Ki might oooooo.....Ki wants pimphand!!!

[Mar 29-08 16:38:24]Nulvect <gossip> monks will be totally redone when I get to them
[Mar 29-08 16:38:26]Cyan <gossip> aren't they the eagledive people?
[Mar 29-08 16:38:32]Sparticus <gossip> no eagledive is scouts
[Mar 29-08 16:38:34]Nulvect <gossip> right now they're boring
[Mar 29-08 16:38:40]Cyan <gossip> ah, ok

[Mar 29-08 16:38:44]Sparticus <gossip> monks are hexa fun thats why i log on mine once a month :(
[Mar 29-08 16:38:46]Rommel <gossip> monks are too good

[Mar 29-08 16:41:46]Nulvect <gossip> it's not meant for killing, it's meant for helping other people with alignment problems :P
[Mar 29-08 16:42:0]Cyan <gossip> like an archangel rogue?
[Mar 29-08 16:42:8]Cyan <gossip> thats the only one I can think of

[Apr 15-08 22:44:41]Kikiyo <gossip> A man and his ever-nagging wife went on a vaction to Jerusalem.  While they were there, the wife passed away.  The undertake told the husband," You can have her shipped home for $5000 or you can bury her here in the Holy Land for $150
[Apr 15-08 22:45:49]Kikiyo <gossip> The man thought about it and told him he would have her shipped home.  The undertaker ask " Why would you spend 5000 to ship your wife home. when it would be wonderful to be buried here and you would only spend $150?
[Apr 15-08 22:46:31]Kikiyo <gossip> the man replied" Long ago a man died here, was buried here, and 3 days later he rose from the dead.  I just cant take that chance....
[Apr 15-08 23:1:10]Nulvect <gossip> haha...
[Apr 15-08 23:1:56]<gossip> Amun fails to find the funny.
[May 5-08 22:58:35]Nulvect <gossip> I'm going to use this line to talk to my testers
[May 5-08 22:58:41]Damien <gossip> k
[May 5-08 22:58:47]Briar <gossip> nod
[May 5-08 22:59:1]Nulvect <gossip> one thing I just remembered, is that anything you do won't be saved right now
[May 5-08 22:59:19]Amun <gossip> just say no!
[May 5-08 22:59:21]Damien <gossip> eh, i didn't want this xp or money anyway ;)
[May 5-08 22:59:25]Nulvect <gossip> anything you do to your player that is... your bank accounts will still go down
[May 5-08 22:59:27]Briar <gossip> well there goes all my xp ive made :P
[May 5-08 22:59:41]Nulvect <gossip> or up
[May 5-08 22:59:41]Damien <gossip> there goes that 100k gold into food :P
[May 5-08 22:59:45]<gossip> Briar goes off to pk everyone...i mean test food
[May 5-08 22:59:51]Nulvect <gossip> any money you can make go ahead and deposit
[May 5-08 23:0:19]Damien <gossip> are these bottles hi5?
[May 5-08 23:0:33]Nulvect <gossip> on another note, I messed up on something and it will let you continue to eat/drink even when full, but it won't contribute to your healing rate
[May 5-08 23:0:59]Briar <gossip> my full and drunk and such seems to fall real fast
[May 5-08 23:1:1]Nulvect <gossip> so you can either log out and back in and that will be fixed, or simply don't eat/drink when you're full
[May 5-08 23:1:23]Briar <gossip> down to 19k
[May 5-08 23:1:31]Briar <gossip> gota go buy food again
[May 5-08 23:2:27]Briar <gossip> seems headaches make you loose hp
[May 5-08 23:2:41]Damien <gossip> 30 seconds of rest got me 616 mp and se
[May 5-08 23:3:9]Damien <gossip> 30 seconds of rest got me 616 mp and 367 hp
[May 5-08 23:3:39]Yun <gossip> hey Nul ill talk to you more about it when i get home, gotta finish up some paper work
[May 5-08 23:3:58]Nulvect <gossip> ok
[May 5-08 23:4:33]Nulvect <gossip> ok krykern, the goal is to exp and do everything you normally would, using only food and drinks for healing
[May 5-08 23:4:41]Nulvect <gossip> you can rest and sleep as well, those help a lot
[May 5-08 23:5:15]Krykern <gossip> hehe ok but i just lot all my eq. ill have to buy some.
[May 5-08 23:5:29]Damien <gossip> 15 seconds of rest got me 97 hp and 114 mp
[May 5-08 23:6:21]Nulvect <gossip> nod, I purposely made different combinations of things work better for different vitals (hp sp mp)
[May 5-08 23:7:19]Briar <gossip> maybe make it auto status every fet beats so when you sleep you can see when your hp sp mp get full
[May 5-08 23:8:13]Nulvect <gossip> you can use the hp command while asleep
[May 5-08 23:8:23]Damien <gossip> you sure?
[May 5-08 23:8:33]Nulvect <gossip> well... it works for me
[May 5-08 23:8:35]Briar <gossip> you can
[May 5-08 23:8:43]Damien <gossip> oh, it must be the aliases i have set
[May 5-08 23:8:45]Briar <gossip> just sucks to have to sit and hit it over and over
[May 5-08 23:9:7]Briar <gossip> sleeping was always a good time to grab a soda or ##@@ or something
[May 5-08 23:9:35]Nulvect <gossip> well you can still do that
[May 5-08 23:9:45]Nulvect <gossip> but you'll be healing up while grabbing a soda
[May 5-08 23:10:15]Damien <gossip> one minute of sleep got me 1044 mp and 705 hp
[May 5-08 23:10:35]Ziggy <gossip> how long does 1044 mp last you
[May 5-08 23:10:41]Damien <gossip> about 2 rounds
[May 5-08 23:11:5]Ziggy <gossip> how many rounds did you spend eating
[May 5-08 23:11:13]Damien <gossip> i forgot to count?
[May 5-08 23:11:25]Damien <gossip> i spent 100k on food and it's almost all gone?
[May 5-08 23:11:39]Briar <gossip> ive spent 5k lots of sleeping though
[May 5-08 23:11:53]Damien <gossip> the higher the level the more to fill up?
[May 5-08 23:11:59]Damien <gossip> or higher the stats?
[May 5-08 23:12:35]Ziggy <gossip> it was originally con and charisma and weirdness
[May 5-08 23:13:3]Damien <gossip> eighty-three empty bottles...
[May 5-08 23:13:17]Briar <gossip> 20 bottles
[May 5-08 23:13:23]Briar <gossip> lots of chicken and crab
[May 5-08 23:14:5]Damien <gossip> k nul, i have to run, take me out of the group fun?
[May 5-08 23:14:39]Briar <gossip> only way i see it helping alot is eat alot of food while xping and get to full, have full status last idk 10 mins or so and have it as a regen for everything idk
[May 5-08 23:15:35]Krykern <gossip> the food doesnt give enough sp to xp well without ointment.
[May 5-08 23:15:39]Damien <gossip> we need more filling food/drink and have it last longer and up the regen rates, that's my take
[May 5-08 23:16:25]Briar <gossip> basicaly
[May 5-08 23:16:44]Damien <gossip> right now i get an average of 200-250hp every 3 rounds with paws, and heads pretty much keep me full of mp all the time
[May 5-08 23:17:0]Damien <gossip> but it's time to head home, later kids
[May 5-08 23:17:11]Briar <gossip> slash costs me what 20 sp?
[May 5-08 23:17:21]Briar <gossip> can drop a mob in roughly 7 slashes
[May 5-08 23:17:34]Briar <gossip> thats just a quick apply ointment after each mob to be at full
[May 5-08 23:17:56]Briar <gossip> oils i can throw on right before a fight and start fighting no waiting for anything
[May 5-08 23:19:32]Nulvect <gossip> hmmm ok
[May 5-08 23:20:4]Krykern <gossip> the food/drink doesnt seem strong enough to replenish sp to xp.
[May 5-08 23:20:17]Briar <gossip> nod
[May 5-08 23:20:22]Nulvect <gossip> what are you all using??
[May 5-08 23:20:42]Briar <gossip> firebreathethers chicken and crabs
[May 5-08 23:20:52]Briar <gossip> the food available in the area
[May 5-08 23:21:12]Krykern <gossip> firebreathers/cakes
[May 5-08 23:21:24]Nulvect <gossip> ok
[May 5-08 23:21:38]Briar <gossip> ive spen 5k and i just sold what i had for about 1k
[May 5-08 23:37:18]Briar <gossip> nul whatelse you want me to play around with on the food

[May 18-08 4:13:24]Nulvect <gossip> "The laughing man is seldom a threat," / "But those who chuckle soon forget," / "The disarray he can beget!"
[May 18-08 4:14:33]Nulvect <gossip> sucky?? workable?? :P
[May 18-08 4:15:1]Nulvect <gossip> amun and I just spent a long time trying to get some lyrics for this, and I just realized we were rhyming with the same words another song uses, heh

[May 18-08 4:18:25]Nulvect <gossip> sure
[May 18-08 4:18:35]Algren <gossip> 2 and 3 line?
[May 18-08 4:19:29]Nulvect <gossip> well I have all the song concepts done, this is the only new attack song and it's definitely 3 lines
[May 18-08 4:19:49]Algren <gossip> hmmm
[May 18-08 4:19:59]Nulvect <gossip> jesters are almost completely mapped out
[May 18-08 4:20:5]Nulvect <gossip> now I just need to make everything
[May 18-08 4:22:21]Algren <gossip> awesome
[May 18-08 4:24:28]Nulvect <gossip> hmm I think those lyrics will work for that song
[May 18-08 4:24:44]Nulvect <gossip> but there are still 3 bard songs needing lyrics on bard board
[May 18-08 4:24:53]Alexander <gossip> you mean jester?

[Sep 8-08 0:30:42]Geddoe <gossip> and he was like, "GIMME!"
[Sep 8-08 0:30:50]Yang <gossip> he said we were ugly and cant read good
[Sep 8-08 0:30:54]Geddoe <gossip> and i already know what happens when you make these dragons mad
[Sep 8-08 0:31:2]Geddoe <gossip> they spear you with tails and dragonfury you :P
[Sep 8-08 0:31:8]Geddoe <gossip> and put you deep into negatives
[Sep 8-08 0:31:44]Yang <gossip> wow didnt know he was wearing pants
[Sep 8-08 0:32:0]Nulvect <gossip> someone must have given him some pants
[Sep 8-08 0:32:0]Yang <gossip> looks at all the clothes on the floor
[Sep 8-08 0:32:30]Geddoe <gossip> now to pointlessly look for more gems!
[Sep 8-08 0:32:44]Yang <gossip> hey exactly what i was going to say
[Sep 8-08 0:32:46]Geddoe <gossip> we are gonna have to sail back to the caves now though arent we
[Sep 8-08 0:36:20]Geddoe <gossip> are we gonna have to get everything again after reboot?
[Sep 8-08 0:36:26]Geddoe <gossip> the driftwood/dagger/gems/etc
[Sep 8-08 0:36:36]Geddoe <gossip> since none of it autos
[Sep 8-08 0:36:56]Pyro <gossip> king is dead, cave of courage is completed, ogre caves will stay open
[Sep 8-08 0:37:4]Pyro <gossip> you will indeed have to find the gems again

[Sep 8-08 0:37:20]Geddoe <gossip> and i know where it is
[Sep 8-08 0:37:28]Geddoe <gossip> so i assuem the wand is useless now then
[Sep 8-08 1:24:50]Geddoe <gossip> i dont suppose the newer ogre cave has an "element"?
[Sep 8-08 1:25:4]Geddoe <gossip> cause there is 4 columns and i only have 3 gems :P
[Sep 8-08 1:25:42]Geddoe <gossip> cause ive got a color for each dragon cept black
[Sep 8-08 1:25:46]Geddoe <gossip> but this new cave is huge :P
[Sep 8-08 1:29:38]Geddoe <gossip> i doubt the elder will stay true to his offer?
[Sep 8-08 1:31:36]Geddoe <gossip> i guess thats a no?
[Sep 8-08 1:31:50]Geddoe <gossip> to the  "Please ask us if you need anything."

[Nov 15-10 7:23:8]Amfortas <gossip> Greetings.
[Nov 17-10 21:30:51]Hakir <gossip> how many ppl are usually on
[Nov 17-10 21:31:13]Leeroy <gossip> depends north the day and such
[Nov 17-10 21:31:27]Leeroy <gossip> on* the day
[Nov 17-10 21:31:49]Leeroy <gossip> this is a little high, almost typical of some days
[Nov 17-10 21:31:53]Stormbringer <gossip> it varies anymore
[Nov 17-10 21:32:3]Hakir <gossip> just quit merentha so im wondering
[Nov 17-10 21:32:5]Leeroy <gossip> Stormy knows best
[Nov 17-10 21:32:13]Leeroy <gossip> this is a fun place
[Nov 17-10 21:32:31]<gossip> Leeroy used to play SM til it died and this place has been a great home
[Nov 17-10 21:32:59]Stormbringer <gossip> we aren't stagnate or idle though, even if we only had a couple of players we would still be working on the mud I think
[Nov 17-10 21:33:21]Leeroy <gossip> imms are approachable and awesome
[Nov 17-10 21:33:29]Leeroy <gossip> case in point. :)
[Nov 17-10 21:33:35]Stormbringer <gossip> lol
[Nov 17-10 21:33:49]Leeroy <gossip> they work on bugs nearly immediately
[Nov 17-10 21:34:23]Leeroy <gossip> they are constantly re-working, have added lots of new areas and systems
[Nov 17-10 21:35:1]Stormbringer <gossip> just some updates ;)
[Nov 17-10 21:39:9]Hakir <gossip> anyone play black ops?
[Nov 17-10 21:39:33]<gossip> Leeroy does!
[Nov 17-10 21:39:45]Leeroy <gossip> ps3. u?
[Nov 17-10 21:39:47]Hakir <gossip> i hate multiplayer its all the same
[Nov 17-10 21:40:3]Hakir <gossip> xbox
[Nov 17-10 21:40:15]Leeroy <gossip> not as awesome as mw2 but it has its little touches
[Nov 17-10 21:40:21]Leeroy <gossip> i like that flamethrower
[Nov 17-10 21:40:23]Hakir <gossip> i just play zombies
[Nov 17-10 21:42:41]Leeroy <gossip> zombies gets intense fast
[Nov 17-10 21:42:59]Hakir <gossip> oh ya... ive only made it to lvl 15
[Nov 17-10 21:43:41]<gossip> Leeroy played thru 7 waves.
[Nov 17-10 21:44:9]Hakir <gossip> whats the weapon that shoots like a shockwave
[Nov 17-10 21:44:27]Leeroy <gossip> no clue, I'm still pretty noob in that game
[Nov 17-10 21:44:45]Leeroy <gossip> i'd check gamefaqs.com
[Nov 17-10 21:44:57]Hakir <gossip> well it kills all zombies in its path with 1 shot. but after a while it takes two
[Nov 17-10 21:45:17]Leeroy <gossip> ahhh, sounds like a pulse cannon of some sort
[Nov 17-10 21:45:39]Hakir <gossip> ya its ridiculous
[Nov 17-10 21:46:9]Hakir <gossip> i hear ppl saying they got to lvl 26 and thats a load of crap... cuz ppl have found a glitch already
[Nov 19-10 8:51:14]<gossip> Amfortas greets the gathered adventurers.

[Nov 19-10 13:22:5]<gossip> Amfortas wabes.
[Nov 19-10 13:22:31]<gossip> Amfortas misses the 'v' by one key.
[Nov 19-10 13:25:21]Nulvect <gossip> way before or way behind??
[Nov 20-10 5:2:57]Amfortas <gossip> Everyone is so quiet.

[Nov 26-10 1:19:2]Riu <gossip> hmm
[Dec 6-10 16:37:18]Stormbringer <gossip> %^BOLD%^Future:
[Dec 29-10 14:31:27]Nulvect <gossip> since we never use this line, I'm going to use it for something that probably won't go well cause it never does :P
[Dec 29-10 14:31:43]Mez <gossip> like what?
[Dec 29-10 14:31:45]Frisky <gossip> ??
[Dec 29-10 14:31:53]Benihime <gossip> do tell!
[Dec 29-10 14:32:13]Nulvect <gossip> I cannot for the life of me come up with a good name for this ability
[Dec 29-10 14:32:29]<gossip> Frisky chuckles
[Dec 29-10 14:32:39]Mez <gossip> describe it and we'll help!
[Dec 29-10 14:32:41]Nulvect <gossip> so I'm recruiting you guys :P
[Dec 29-10 14:33:13]Frisky <gossip> Class-specific ability?
[Dec 29-10 14:33:17]Nulvect <gossip> it's an ability for dual wielding two different weapon types to do different attacks together
[Dec 29-10 14:33:37]Nulvect <gossip> any two weapon types, so words like slash, stab, etc won't work
[Dec 29-10 14:34:11]Yang <gossip> ambidex
[Dec 29-10 14:34:11]Frisky <gossip> So generic for any 2 weapon types?
[Dec 29-10 14:34:15]Vian <gossip> grasp?  grip?
[Dec 29-10 14:34:21]Vian <gossip> are you looking for the alternate to <wield>?
[Dec 29-10 14:34:41]<gossip> Frisky slaps Vian
[Dec 29-10 14:34:43]Nulvect <gossip> no, it's basically going to be <abilname slash stab monster>
[Dec 29-10 14:34:47]Frisky <gossip> Name of an ability
[Dec 29-10 14:35:10]Nulvect <gossip> so a verbal phrase involving some kind of 'combining' feel would be best
[Dec 29-10 14:35:21]Nulvect <gossip> but a noun could work too
[Dec 29-10 14:35:27]Vian <gossip> doublefu
[Dec 29-10 14:35:27]Vian <gossip> ermm
[Dec 29-10 14:35:47]Frisky <gossip> Why not just 'combo'
[Dec 29-10 14:36:17]Nulvect <gossip> sounds kind of generic... it's also the term I've used for monk ability chains
[Dec 29-10 14:36:41]Frisky <gossip> Well that is true.
[Dec 29-10 14:36:43]Yang <gossip> poly-wield!
[Dec 29-10 14:36:48]Frisky <gossip> Slice and dice?
[Dec 29-10 14:36:49]Nulvect <gossip> haha
[Dec 29-10 14:37:4]Nulvect <gossip> staffs and whips don't slice
[Dec 29-10 14:37:48]Nulvect <gossip> I've considered things like crossweave, entwine, dualstrike, twinblitz...
[Dec 29-10 14:39:0]Nulvect <gossip> other 'two', 'together', or 'attack' words include twofold, twin, bi-, di-, conjoin, merge, converge, meld, assault, onslaught, force, wield, swing...
[Dec 29-10 14:39:10]Frisky <gossip> 1v1 ability?
[Dec 29-10 14:39:26]Wally <gossip> ambistrike!
[Dec 29-10 14:39:28]Nulvect <gossip> I -could- just reclaim the 'combine' command since we're not actually using it yet, but it doesn't sound all that cool to me
[Dec 29-10 14:39:30]Vian <gossip> um
[Dec 29-10 14:39:36]Nulvect <gossip> yeah frisky
[Dec 29-10 14:39:46]Vian <gossip> are you going to have to do "blah slash and stab" or wil it figure it out if youre wielding a knief and sword that you can just "blah monster"
[Dec 29-10 14:40:10]Nulvect <gossip> perhaps slash stab is different from stab slash, vian
[Dec 29-10 14:40:12]Frisky <gossip> generic Vian
[Dec 29-10 14:40:34]Frisky <gossip> one name to cover all weapons
[Dec 29-10 14:40:54]Nulvect <gossip> I am not really feeling the 'ambi-' prefix
[Dec 29-10 14:40:58]Vian <gossip> ah nul okay
[Dec 29-10 14:41:32]Frisky <gossip> Silly peeps
[Dec 29-10 14:41:36]Nulvect <gossip> maybe we could do a little creative repurposing and use omni-
[Dec 29-10 14:41:50]Nulvect <gossip> it's an ability zair, and over on gossip line :P
[Dec 29-10 14:43:42]Frisky <gossip> one word? or multiple?
[Dec 29-10 14:44:18]Nulvect <gossip> our ability and spell names do not allow spaces, so multiple words would have to be crammed together, like 'mindstab'
[Dec 29-10 14:45:52]Nulvect <gossip> words involving mastery or skill could also be good, heh
[Dec 29-10 14:48:40]Frisky <gossip> What sub gets it?
[Dec 29-10 14:48:50]Frisky <gossip> or who gets it rather
[Dec 29-10 14:49:24]A shadow <gossip> i think its an easy guess ;p
[Dec 29-10 14:50:10]Frisky <gossip> I never guess/assume
[Dec 29-10 14:51:22]Frisky <gossip> Multiswing?
[Dec 29-10 14:52:26]Frisky <gossip> If it got better with more skill.. say 3 hits or 4
[Dec 29-10 14:52:40]Nulvect <gossip> that is not currently the plan
[Dec 29-10 14:52:56]<gossip> Frisky wonders
[Dec 29-10 14:53:16]Frisky <gossip> Not many good words for 'attack'
[Dec 29-10 14:53:20]Nulvect <gossip> dualstrike is one of the more generic terms though... I hate using "strike"... it's like saying "I can't think of a real name"
[Dec 29-10 14:53:32]Frisky <gossip> Me too
[Dec 29-10 14:53:34]Frisky <gossip> lol
[Dec 29-10 14:53:46]Nulvect <gossip> crossweave is what I'm leaning towards at the moment
[Dec 29-10 14:53:50]Micky <gossip> multi swing multi weapon abil named Frenzy
[Dec 29-10 14:54:0]Vian <gossip> where does natalie portman find the time to make SO MANY MOVIES
[Dec 29-10 14:54:10]Nulvect <gossip> on another line, probably
[Dec 29-10 14:54:19]Nulvect <gossip> :P
[Dec 29-10 14:54:26]Vian <gossip> i'd say thats more gossip than talk about mudding ;P
[Dec 29-10 14:54:52]Frisky <gossip> If you seen Nuls first message... youd know why we were on gossip
[Dec 29-10 14:55:10]Vian <gossip> yeah yeah
[Dec 29-10 14:55:14]<gossip> Vian goes to the vampire line.
[Dec 29-10 14:55:40]Frisky <gossip> Gotta be dual/multi
[Dec 29-10 14:55:55]Frisky <gossip> just getting the second part is blah
[Dec 29-10 14:56:6]Frisky <gossip> i like twin too
[Dec 29-10 14:57:31]Nulvect <gossip> all on here please, I have people sending me tells and talking on class lines now :P
[Dec 29-10 14:58:6]Nulvect <gossip> I think things like "frenzy" or "whirlwind" don't fit the style of the attack
[Dec 29-10 14:58:29]Frisky <gossip> I thought about those. That is why i asked who got it
[Dec 29-10 14:58:38]Nulvect <gossip> warriors
[Dec 29-10 14:58:42]Frisky <gossip> and it seems 1vAll
[Dec 29-10 14:59:2]Nulvect <gossip> it's a controlled, use both weapons at once on one attacker, type of ability
[Dec 29-10 14:59:10]Yang <gossip> oops
[Dec 29-10 14:59:17]Vian <gossip> what if you could stab one and slash one at the same time
[Dec 29-10 14:59:26]Vian <gossip> whirlwind stab monster 1 slash monster 2
[Dec 29-10 14:59:28]Vian <gossip> lolz
[Dec 29-10 14:59:44]Frisky <gossip> Blunts dont stab/slash
[Dec 29-10 14:59:50]Nulvect <gossip> we have that, it's called whirl
[Dec 29-10 15:0:39]Vian <gossip> oh
[Dec 29-10 15:1:11]Nulvect <gossip> I am not against the possibility of certain weapon combinations somehow hitting multiple attackers at higher levels (though I do not see at this moment how that would work), but that is neither here nor there as it doesn't really affect the name much
[Dec 29-10 15:2:3]Frisky <gossip> Zeal?
[Dec 29-10 15:3:4]Nulvect <gossip> sounds like a paladin buff
[Dec 29-10 15:4:16]Vian <gossip> i kinda like how twinstrike sounds
[Dec 29-10 15:4:18]Micky <gossip> i say just toss a prefix on it and call it good
[Dec 29-10 15:4:20]Vian <gossip> i know you dont like strike but
[Dec 29-10 15:4:40]Micky <gossip> is it more like a beat?
[Dec 29-10 15:4:48]Micky <gossip> beat slash stab
[Dec 29-10 15:4:54]Nulvect <gossip> beat??
[Dec 29-10 15:4:58]Vian <gossip> truestrike is one of my favorite sayings
[Dec 29-10 15:5:8]Baine <gossip> nice d2 reference frisky haha
[Dec 29-10 15:5:27]Frisky <gossip> ikr
[Dec 29-10 15:5:37]Nulvect <gossip> that actually sounds kind of cool vian, sounds more like a paladin attack though
[Dec 29-10 15:5:49]Baine <gossip> why not just call it greatcleave or something haha
[Dec 29-10 15:6:1]Micky <gossip> cleave would almost fit
[Dec 29-10 15:6:9]Baine <gossip> well cleave is single target
[Dec 29-10 15:6:19]Baine <gossip> great cleave however, allows you to cleave the next target if you kill the first
[Dec 29-10 15:6:19]Micky <gossip> and for after death right?
[Dec 29-10 15:6:23]Baine <gossip> and it chains together
[Dec 29-10 15:6:27]Nulvect <gossip> cleave has a bladey-slashy feel, doesn't work
[Dec 29-10 15:6:45]Nulvect <gossip> I don't know what you mean by that last line micky
[Dec 29-10 15:7:1]Baine <gossip> what weapon type are you discussing
[Dec 29-10 15:7:3]Micky <gossip> was saying cleave only effects u if u kill soemthing
[Dec 29-10 15:7:5]Baine <gossip> sorry i joined a little late
[Dec 29-10 15:7:9]Frisky <gossip> all types
[Dec 29-10 15:7:23]Nulvect <gossip> still dunno what you mean
[Dec 29-10 15:7:27]Vian <gossip> could use feat
[Dec 29-10 15:7:29]Frisky <gossip> an ability using any 2 weapons... that uses both weapons like a combo
[Dec 29-10 15:7:31]Vian <gossip> doublefeat
[Dec 29-10 15:7:35]Baine <gossip> he was refering to cleave in d&d nul
[Dec 29-10 15:7:37]Vian <gossip> twinfeat
[Dec 29-10 15:7:47]Micky <gossip> omnifeint
[Dec 29-10 15:7:51]Baine <gossip> if you kill an opponant with great clave, you cleave the next closest victim
[Dec 29-10 15:8:25]Nulvect <gossip> dualstroke??
[Dec 29-10 15:8:29]Nulvect <gossip> hmmm
[Dec 29-10 15:8:35]Frisky <gossip> LOL
[Dec 29-10 15:8:35]Baine <gossip> that sounds nasty
[Dec 29-10 15:8:41]Cotaindre <gossip> sounds sexual
[Dec 29-10 15:8:51]Baine <gossip> frisky has a mad dualstroke
[Dec 29-10 15:8:57]Nulvect <gossip> sigh
[Dec 29-10 15:9:33]Frisky <gossip> strike is just blah
[Dec 29-10 15:10:3]Micky <gossip> why not just straight up double whatever
[Dec 29-10 15:10:13]Micky <gossip> doublestrike stab slice
[Dec 29-10 15:10:23]Baine <gossip> or multislice
[Dec 29-10 15:10:23]Nulvect <gossip> you're not doing the same thing twice, you're doing two different things...
[Dec 29-10 15:10:29]Micky <gossip> move the strike for stab or slice
[Dec 29-10 15:10:31]Nulvect <gossip> hmm
[Dec 29-10 15:10:39]Micky <gossip> oh i see now
[Dec 29-10 15:10:45]Baine <gossip> multi is more general, not specific
[Dec 29-10 15:10:55]<gossip> Frisky agrees
[Dec 29-10 15:13:5]Micky <gossip> i'm thinking like when a samurai attack with two weapons is it called anything?
[Dec 29-10 15:13:51]Micky <gossip> you could call it a stance... like blankstance stab smash
[Dec 29-10 15:14:17]Micky <gossip> but that kinda sounds like it's passive
[Dec 29-10 15:14:49]Frisky <gossip> Vigorousblow?
[Dec 29-10 15:15:25]Nulvect <gossip> hmmm
[Dec 29-10 15:16:29]Nulvect <gossip> I'm still leaning to crossweave or crosswield
[Dec 29-10 15:17:1]Frisky <gossip> hmmm
[Dec 29-10 15:18:5]Frisky <gossip> crosswield doesnt seem like an ability name.
[Dec 29-10 15:19:7]Micky <gossip> i like frenzy
[Dec 29-10 15:19:10]Baine <gossip> sounds like how you wield drum sticks
[Dec 29-10 15:19:20]Baine <gossip> crosswield sticks to hit that crazy cymbol
[Dec 29-10 15:19:28]Micky <gossip> lol
[Dec 29-10 15:20:38]Nulvect <gossip> crossflow?? hmm sounds like a spell
[Dec 29-10 15:21:4]Frisky <gossip> Kinda
[Dec 29-10 15:21:24]Baine <gossip> what would be cool is an archer type class lol
[Dec 29-10 15:21:32]Baine <gossip> they could have volley and all that cool stuff
[Dec 29-10 15:26:16]Nulvect <gossip> chain, interchain, chainweave, splice, graft...
[Dec 29-10 15:26:38]Yang <gossip> mmmm splice
[Dec 29-10 15:27:6]Yang <gossip> polymerge
[Dec 29-10 15:27:14]Baine <gossip> lol splice
[Dec 29-10 15:27:22]Yang <gossip> it sounded better in my head... nm
[Dec 29-10 15:27:28]Nulvect <gossip> hehe yeah that happens
[Dec 29-10 15:27:28]<gossip> Baine rides in on his rat-horse.
[Dec 29-10 15:29:58]Yang <gossip> Sb is good with words and thinking and stuff.... lets ask him
[Dec 29-10 15:31:38]Nulvect <gossip> haha
[Dec 29-10 15:31:58]Stormbringer <gossip> gooseneck stomp!
[Dec 29-10 15:32:10]Stormbringer <gossip> guess not ;)
[Dec 29-10 15:32:30]Yang <gossip> close... close but we need your answer in a question form... thanks for Playing SB
[Dec 29-10 15:33:16]Stormbringer <gossip> How do you get the gander to stop honking?
[Dec 29-10 15:33:24]Stormbringer <gossip> ;)
[Dec 29-10 15:35:35]Nulvect <gossip> this tab stacking in opera just came in handy... had too many thesaurus.com tabs to read the titles :P
[Dec 29-10 15:46:42]Nulvect <gossip> ok, I'm just going to go with crossweave on this :P
