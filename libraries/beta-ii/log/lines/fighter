[Mar 27-06 22:49:13]Arthryn %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ anything different other than the colors?
[Mar 27-06 22:49:23]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it was a complete rewrite

[Mar 28-06 10:58:9]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ how goes the new slash?
[Mar 28-06 11:40:27]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I see we have switched to gore
[Mar 28-06 11:40:39]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yes. until i get ferocity better
[Mar 28-06 11:40:50]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nod nod
[Mar 28-06 11:41:0]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ my slash is significantly weaker than gore (and a few others) and i take more damagte while using it
[Mar 28-06 11:41:8]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i'm with holding judgement till i max ferocity
[Mar 28-06 11:41:12]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i love the new look though
[Mar 28-06 11:41:54]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ are there other skills besides ferocity that i am missing?
[Mar 28-06 11:43:8]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ drow general's slash used to do about 680. now it does about 500 to me. thats all i know for sure so far
[Mar 28-06 12:48:29]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Ramen wonders if he will need to train Valor when Dab starts working on paladins
[Mar 28-06 12:48:39]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yes you will
[Mar 28-06 12:48:55]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ some figher abilities will now use it and similar skills
[Mar 28-06 12:49:13]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Vyce is training ferocity up right now... glad it finally has a use
[Mar 28-06 12:49:29]Ramen %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Yes I'm happy bout it too :D
[Mar 28-06 12:49:45]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i'm hopeful for more useful abilities than just slash like we had before. should be cool
[Mar 28-06 13:57:3]Ramen %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is charge still blade only? Its beena  while since I been a fighter
[Mar 28-06 14:4:57]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so what is good to use now?
[Mar 28-06 14:5:17]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so far i use gore and hack until i can get ferocity maxxed
[Mar 28-06 14:5:35]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ gore doesnt count as i dont have it lol
[Mar 28-06 14:5:41]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not sure how much my slash is doing currently but its at least a round slower on drow
[Mar 28-06 14:6:1]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you can check stuff on me in arena if you wish
[Mar 28-06 14:6:19]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if charging effects rush still that might be the best now
[Mar 28-06 14:6:55]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you wont report for me, i need a reporter
[Mar 28-06 14:7:5]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i'll get myst

[Mar 28-06 14:28:47]Vyce %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ chaoswave from a lvl 40 does about 400 to me
[Mar 28-06 14:28:55]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I don't care about chaoswave
[Mar 28-06 14:29:11]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ don't ever compare about old abilities to my new one
[Mar 28-06 14:29:21]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they are incompatible
[Mar 28-06 14:29:53]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and comparing two players with vastly different stats also is useless
[Mar 28-06 14:30:57]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ to you dabs

[May 5-06 14:23:43]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Makenshi still doesn't know what subclass to pick. Was thinking anti for the strength booster at 20
[May 5-06 14:24:13]Firoaetodisreti %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i just picked anti cause it sounded fun, ton of skills though
[May 5-06 14:25:9]Makenshi %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Well, you have magic attack and magic defense. I wouldn't max those, they seem pointless for an anti. Outside of that you have healing, another no, faith, yes, for bloodlust. Hmmmm....attack, defense, perception, ferocity, blade (or whatever weapon) What else?
[May 5-06 14:25:25]Makenshi %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ charging

[May 5-06 14:26:19]Firoaetodisreti %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i will do attack, charging, defense, double wielding, faith, healing for boost, ferocity, perception, stealth, blade, and maybe ma and md
[May 5-06 14:26:55]Makenshi %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ why stealth?
[May 5-06 14:27:1]Firoaetodisreti %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cause i might get something cool :D

[Jul 17-06 3:47:6]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, my idea was to give them a bunch of abilities that use different weapon types
[Jul 17-06 3:47:12]Inuyasha %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cool
[Jul 17-06 3:47:14]Inuyasha %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but
[Jul 17-06 3:47:22]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ such as a whip and knife move where you tangle them, pull them in, and stab them
[Jul 17-06 3:47:32]Inuyasha %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ flail/ranged/blunt/projectile weapons arent very strong

[Jul 17-06 3:48:32]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I think the main thing keeping people from using different weapons is the lack of abilities
[Jul 17-06 3:48:34]Inuyasha %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what does parity mean
[Jul 17-06 3:48:50]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's a synonym for balance, the only one that was 6 or less chars and sounded good
[Jul 17-06 3:48:56]Inuyasha %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah

[Jul 17-06 23:1:29]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what if it was more of a balanced, more = than jumpin all around
[Jul 17-06 23:1:31]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, often they are portrayed as being wise, yes
[Jul 17-06 23:2:58]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm, I'll make a note of it, but probably won't be changing stats much for a while
[Jul 17-06 23:3:10]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ have a little more str/con than the rest, but have more balanced nods-
[Jul 17-06 23:3:16]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok, thank you for listening
[Jul 17-06 23:3:22]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ :D
[Jul 17-06 23:3:22]%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Jul 17-06 23:4:36]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ also, idk if it is still on log or file or whatever the word is
[Jul 17-06 23:4:52]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but awhile ago i put in an idea about a new race
[Jul 17-06 23:5:14]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what should i do to get that looked at again?
[Jul 17-06 23:5:48]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's probably still logged
[Jul 17-06 23:6:2]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Jul 18-06 23:5:47]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hey nul
[Jul 18-06 23:6:5]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i have another idea, not a life changing one, but one nonetheless
[Jul 18-06 23:6:47]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ shoot
[Jul 18-06 23:7:19]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ with the whole "drunk" thing on here, what if while you were intoxicated..instead of having forcing us to emote, we have it to where it forces us to stumble about and go different directions.  like i want to go east 5 times, i start heading that way and then BAM it takes me south b/c i am stumbling drunk
[Jul 18-06 23:7:41]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what you think?
[Jul 18-06 23:8:27]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ or you just all of a sudden fall down
[Jul 18-06 23:8:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm, decent idea, but it wouldn't be anything but entertainment until there's a reason for people to drink
[Jul 18-06 23:8:53]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, it would hinder XPin to an extent
[Jul 18-06 23:9:3]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and it could be problematic for pyros
[Jul 18-06 23:9:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ pyros never needed to actually drink.. and nobody I know of uses drinks for exp right now
[Jul 18-06 23:9:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ even with an elite bard that can make himself undrunk, it was just much slower than oils/ointments
[Jul 18-06 23:9:59]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ by hindering XPin i meant, get drunk try to go one way end up back in the room and possibly die
[Jul 18-06 23:10:11]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but i have never played a pyro, i assumed they drank the alky
[Jul 18-06 23:10:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, it would be something to implement, but after I make food and drinks something people want to use
[Jul 18-06 23:10:45]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect notes it
[Jul 18-06 23:10:55]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods- thanks
[Jul 18-06 23:10:57]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh btw
[Jul 18-06 23:11:15]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if the code for food and drinks change, let me know please, as i have food and drinks in my next area
[Jul 18-06 23:11:55]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well bah, since we're talkin i have a ?
[Jul 18-06 23:12:1]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh, no, it would be a change in the underlying code
[Jul 18-06 23:12:11]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just you me and stormy on this line so may i ask here?
[Jul 18-06 23:12:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sure
[Jul 18-06 23:12:49]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods- as you know, nesoo was workin on the elite ointment code
[Jul 18-06 23:13:17]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, everytime someone would try to get it workin on builders it would mess up, so i made my "oinment" from scratch so to speak
[Jul 18-06 23:13:27]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ will that be acceptible if it is in balance?
[Jul 18-06 23:13:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmmm, dunno
[Jul 18-06 23:13:57]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ should i ask stormy that one?
[Jul 18-06 23:16:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ probably better if it uses the code nesoo was working on... or something similar
[Jul 18-06 23:17:5]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but if it's balanced ok, it can easily be changed over later
[Jul 18-06 23:17:27]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-  did you want to come check it out? so i know if i need to change it
[Jul 18-06 23:17:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ in a bit
[Jul 18-06 23:17:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ in the middle of a spell
[Jul 18-06 23:18:19]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods- might have to be another time, it's almost 11:30 here and i am fadin lol
[Jul 18-06 23:19:31]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ btw thank you
[Jul 18-06 23:19:49]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's nice being able to actually give ideas and not be yelled at
[Jul 18-06 23:20:21]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ even if they are crappy lol
[Jul 18-06 23:20:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ np
[Jul 20-06 23:31:9]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ grats
[Jul 21-06 1:14:22]Lorelai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ news
[Jul 21-06 1:14:26]Lorelai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oops
[Jul 22-06 0:58:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they can use 1 less hand to wield multiple-handed weapons once they get enough skill
[Jul 22-06 0:59:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's not on your abil list or anything
[Jul 22-06 4:9:41]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ bug with slash
[Jul 22-06 4:9:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what's that
[Jul 22-06 4:10:11]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if im not wielding a sword and i type "slash monster" the monster attacks me
[Jul 22-06 4:10:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah
[Jul 22-06 4:10:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, don't do that for now... slash will be replaced soon
[Jul 22-06 4:10:33]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ same with hack
[Jul 22-06 4:10:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ same response
[Jul 22-06 4:10:47]Cyan %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ will be replaced? with what?
[Jul 22-06 4:10:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ with a new slash and other abilities
[Jul 22-06 4:11:7]Cyan %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cool
[Jul 22-06 4:11:9]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ less or more dmg?
[Jul 22-06 4:11:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I've coded up 2 abilities for each weapon type that anyone can use
[Jul 22-06 4:11:35]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, except ranged and melee, haven't done those yet
[Jul 22-06 4:11:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the damage of the new slash will be comparable to lash, which is a new flail move
[Jul 22-06 4:12:29]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the slash before the present one was really cool
[Jul 22-06 4:12:45]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you mean the one where you got one hit per weapon wielded??
[Jul 22-06 4:13:5]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ noo where the hits increase as your skill and level increases
[Jul 22-06 4:13:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the current one does that, the new one not so much
[Jul 22-06 4:13:37]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the current one does not give more dmg with the increased hits
[Jul 22-06 4:14:55]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and the dmg of charge lessens as you level which really seems lame
[Jul 22-06 4:15:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'll look at charge later
[Jul 22-06 4:15:27]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nod
[Jul 22-06 4:15:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's an opening move, which have different rules
[Jul 22-06 4:16:15]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and please trim the colours from the present moves, the new chop is cool
[Jul 22-06 4:16:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thanks
[Jul 22-06 4:16:45]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the earlier abilities had way too much colours
[Jul 22-06 4:16:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's weaker than hack at newbie levels, but a level 5 fighter doesn't need to be killing level 15 mobs in 4-5 rounds anyway...
[Jul 22-06 4:16:59]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nod
[Jul 22-06 4:17:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I agree, and most people have said all the colors suck, so I toned it way down
[Jul 22-06 4:18:1]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ umm chop shows up in my [Other] abilities
[Jul 22-06 4:18:1]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I picked one color for each weapon type and applied it to appropriate words only, heh
[Jul 22-06 4:18:7]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Jul 22-06 4:18:11]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nod that is kewl
[Jul 22-06 4:18:31]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ abilities with lots of colours seem kinda fake...
[Jul 22-06 4:18:35]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ don't worry if they show up under other right now, I'll fix it when they're all in
[Jul 22-06 4:21:39]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lash is mid ability?
[Jul 22-06 4:21:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hm
[Jul 22-06 4:22:27]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah
[Jul 22-06 4:22:51]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i have max flail for a mid but i dont have it :(
[Jul 22-06 4:23:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, if you level, I won't tell anyone :P
[Jul 22-06 4:24:3]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ :D naw
[Jul 22-06 4:28:49]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ same problem with gore as with slash and hack
[Jul 22-06 4:29:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok, that one I'll fix
[Jul 22-06 4:29:13]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kewl
[Jul 22-06 4:30:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok, gore shouldn't put you in combat if you're too low on sp now
[Jul 22-06 4:30:39]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kewl thnx a lot!
[Jul 22-06 4:31:23]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect man you just rock
[Jul 22-06 4:31:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ heh, that was just a simple bug
[Jul 22-06 4:31:51]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ive been telling the other guys about it for like a year and you fix it in a minute
[Jul 22-06 4:32:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just checking things in the wrong order
[Jul 22-06 4:34:43]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ gore going to be worked upon or it stays the way it is?
[Jul 22-06 4:35:10]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ neat bloodlust went into faith spells
[Jul 22-06 4:35:38]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah I edited it to be a spell, since it used mp
[Jul 22-06 4:35:58]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nod it IS a spell
[Jul 22-06 4:36:16]Knuckle %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ seemed lame in other abilities
[Jul 22-06 16:43:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ will you guys get pissed at me if I replace slash with my new slash before I make some higher level moves?? :P
[Jul 22-06 16:44:10]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i dont even use slash
[Jul 22-06 16:44:12]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no hack is hella better than slash
[Jul 22-06 16:44:14]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so go for it
[Jul 22-06 16:44:22]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you like the new hack??
[Jul 22-06 16:44:24]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hack sucks too :\
[Jul 22-06 16:44:28]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ya

[Jul 22-06 16:44:58]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no downgrade

[Jul 22-06 16:45:24]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, it might be a bit too strong, it does about 6x more body damage than anything else
[Jul 22-06 16:45:32]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thats okay
[Jul 22-06 16:45:44]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect watches
[Jul 22-06 16:45:46]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i need someone to let me hack them please
[Jul 22-06 16:46:16]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well in sewers i was chopin all the demons and angels up
[Jul 22-06 16:46:32]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ may i hack you and see the damage please?
[Jul 22-06 16:46:42]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well i am in lodos *grins*
[Jul 22-06 16:46:44]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok
[Jul 22-06 16:56:48]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if hack gets downgraded can we get a new abil cause i have hack for the last 20 lvs
[Jul 22-06 16:57:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ spart, this is a new hack that I just put in today
[Jul 22-06 16:57:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the only thing I'll be changing is how much body damage it does
[Jul 22-06 16:57:16]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i thought u were gonna down it?
[Jul 22-06 16:57:20]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ o
[Jul 22-06 16:57:22]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kk
[Jul 22-06 16:57:36]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ each tier 2 ability does something special
[Jul 22-06 16:57:44]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hack does 5-6 times normal body damage right now
[Jul 22-06 16:58:4]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i think it did it mostly to the one hackin lol
[Jul 22-06 17:3:59]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it did less than 300 damage
[Jul 22-06 17:4:3]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i was slashing
[Jul 22-06 17:4:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ your slash did less than 300 to sparticus??
[Jul 22-06 17:4:17]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yes
[Jul 22-06 17:4:21]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ under
[Jul 22-06 17:4:31]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ aw..

[Jul 22-06 17:4:47]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ k
[Jul 22-06 17:5:11]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that was like 100hp better
[Jul 22-06 17:5:19]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but still
[Jul 22-06 17:5:39]Sparticus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that one did about 315
[Jul 22-06 17:5:43]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ aye
[Jul 22-06 17:7:57]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ odd, copying your level and stats and with slightly higher skills, I'm seeing it should do about twice what it's doing
[Jul 22-06 17:9:5]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that is odd
[Jul 22-06 17:11:7]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ahhhhh I see
[Jul 22-06 17:11:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ forgot all player vs player damage is halved
[Jul 22-06 17:12:22]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ dun dun dun
[Jul 22-06 17:12:34]Sparticus %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ carina what lv r u?

[Jul 22-06 17:13:0]Sparticus %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ couldve double charged
[Jul 22-06 17:13:6]Sparticus %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if ur in me range
[Jul 22-06 17:13:16]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ aye
[Jul 22-06 17:14:32]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, slash should be fine for exping, it's not meant to scale into elite levels but it's still usable up there
[Jul 22-06 17:14:44]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i use headbutt -shrugs-
[Jul 22-06 17:15:18]Sparticus %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i've always thought headbutt is wimpy
[Jul 22-06 17:15:36]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not mine
[Jul 22-06 17:15:46]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it is my best secondary move
[Jul 22-06 17:16:12]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ charge is obviously 1st, but i have had the same charge since lvl 36...with mains stats of 72
[Jul 22-06 17:16:22]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i am over double that in stats now and lvl 55
[Jul 22-06 17:16:32]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ needless to say charge is overpowered when your lil
[Jul 22-06 17:16:38]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and crappy when you get bigger
[Jul 22-06 17:17:22]Sparticus %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ do u even use parry?
[Jul 22-06 17:17:32]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not once
[Jul 22-06 17:17:46]Sparticus %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is there even any point of it
[Jul 22-06 17:17:58]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nope
[Jul 22-06 17:18:16]Sparticus %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what bout whirl?
[Jul 22-06 17:18:26]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ good to stop initiating attacks
[Jul 22-06 17:18:42]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and good in lodos and tene b/c i can kill the manymobed rooms quickly
[Jul 22-06 17:18:58]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but hey, im going to go watch a movie
[Jul 22-06 17:19:0]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ill bbl
[Jul 22-06 17:30:56]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok, tuned hack body damage back up a little bit
[Jul 23-06 22:59:26]Zekial %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so is it worth training other weapons yet or?
[Jul 23-06 23:0:0]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not that i know
[Jul 23-06 23:21:7]Zekial %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sweet... new commands...
[Jul 24-06 2:10:3]Zekial %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Anyone know if we can charge with a blunt or projectile yet?

[Jul 29-06 4:45:35]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ there are two abilities for each weapon type now that anyone can get
[Jul 29-06 4:45:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they are all under the weapon category
[Jul 29-06 4:45:51]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ 1 is warblade?
[Jul 29-06 4:45:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no, that's just fighters
[Jul 29-06 4:46:53]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ warblade work on rage?
[Jul 29-06 4:47:7]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not yet
[Jul 29-06 4:50:45]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is there any message in maul, if you daze the opponent?
[Jul 29-06 4:55:7]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ warblade supposed to be 1 of the best abils that fighters get?
[Jul 29-06 4:55:47]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the help file would lead me to believe that
[Jul 29-06 4:56:15]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i compared it to few other abils, and it does even less than maul :D
[Jul 29-06 4:58:25]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ warblade does about same as rush
[Jul 29-06 4:59:49]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you gonna work more on fighter abils?
[Jul 29-06 5:6:29]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm, i can whirl without weapons :/

[Aug 3-06 3:49:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok, bug fixes to rage, it should hit mobs with mis-coded names (ie with color in them), also being disarmed is no longer a major issue
[Aug 3-06 3:49:47]Bahamut %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cooL...GOOD WORK NUL
[Aug 5-06 0:33:30]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i also think that rangers should have some sort of cloaking device.  Like an item that we can make that can make us camo and unseen.
[Aug 5-06 0:33:40]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ as that is something real life rangers can do
[Aug 5-06 0:33:48]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just a thought -shrugs-
[Aug 5-06 0:33:52]Armzza %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ scouts should have bows!
[Aug 5-06 0:34:10]Armzza %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like bows that work
[Aug 5-06 0:34:32]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they should have lil books and pens and all to record how much better and good we all are...b/c a scout only scouts for talent
[Aug 5-06 0:35:38]Armzza %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ?
[Aug 5-06 0:35:48]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nothing...nvmd
[Aug 5-06 12:51:30]Brem %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ It seems parry didn't get any better.
[Aug 6-06 0:15:6]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ changing forage right now, just a heads up
[Aug 6-06 4:7:9]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ did you take an ideas i had for rangers at all?
[Aug 6-06 4:7:47]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I haven't started making new stuff yet, minor changes to forage already and a bit with build here in a minute
[Aug 6-06 4:7:57]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Aug 6-06 4:8:25]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ seems like im losing less sp with forage
[Aug 6-06 4:8:55]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and its just "wood" rather than twig or stick etc etc
[Aug 6-06 4:9:25]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and i get a lot more when i do it!
[Aug 6-06 4:10:9]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ 5 mudballs each time, 6 herbs and a lot of wood
[Aug 6-06 4:10:13]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nice
[Aug 6-06 4:10:39]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ shouldn't be getting 6 herbs at a time...
[Aug 6-06 4:10:49]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i meant 3 sorry
[Aug 6-06 4:10:57]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah, k
[Aug 6-06 4:11:3]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ forgot i did it twice, then i just did it to double check and i have 9 now
[Aug 6-06 4:11:51]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ after I get build working right, I can apply the same code style to make, make is much larger...
[Aug 6-06 4:12:15]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods- are you going to make it to where campfires heal more with a certain skill?
[Aug 6-06 4:12:43]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you can check that out in a min
[Aug 6-06 4:12:51]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-

[Aug 6-06 4:38:48]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i didnt realize it was this good then...i dont know if it's my lvl or if it just works really well
[Aug 6-06 4:39:22]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ may be something you want to look into...i have nothing on and my armour went from lightly armoured to well armoured with 1 lil mudarmor
[Aug 6-06 4:39:42]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that's not _that_ big a difference
[Aug 6-06 4:39:56]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i know, but it is if you're lower lvl
[Aug 6-06 4:40:12]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ b/c it's the same for everyone..requarless of lvl

[Aug 6-06 4:51:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ k, turned that down

[Aug 12-06 2:41:29]Jardes %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ discern whip Whip is of type projectile.

[Aug 12-06 2:47:35]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I didn't, but it probably will get a bit of an update
[Aug 12-06 3:6:57]Jardes %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is there alot of flail abilities because its one of the palys main skills?
[Aug 12-06 3:7:17]Jardes %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ or do most stick to just blades.
[Aug 12-06 22:56:59]Slade %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Don't have shoot, but I will the others
[Aug 12-06 22:59:21]Slade %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ make seems to work fine, along with forage.
[Aug 12-06 23:0:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'm especially interested in how well rangers can exp with bows now that you can make your own bows, quivers, and arrows and with the changes to forage
[Aug 13-06 1:46:8]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is there anything i should refrain from messin with nul?
[Aug 13-06 1:46:20]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nope

[Aug 13-06 1:46:40]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'd really like to know how ranged combat works compared to swords
[Aug 13-06 1:47:30]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, my expierience with my "shoot" was, you had to be in a different room than the target and when it hit..it did 0 damage
[Aug 13-06 1:47:42]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ since I put in the new shoot??
[Aug 13-06 1:48:2]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ didnt know there was a new shoot, there was nothing on the ranger board about it
[Aug 13-06 1:48:14]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I try to put all my updates in updatenews
[Aug 13-06 1:48:24]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ which i think only imms know about
[Aug 13-06 1:52:18]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, shoot, forage, make, track, build, and gut were changed, and barrage is a new ability
[Aug 13-06 1:53:44]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ shoot works now, that's cool
[Aug 13-06 2:9:16]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ make and track were changed? so i assume the made items are no longer bugged
[Aug 13-06 2:9:22]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what's different with track?
[Aug 13-06 2:9:58]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ track wasn't changed
[Aug 13-06 2:10:8]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i thought you just said they were
[Aug 13-06 2:10:28]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if you do last fighter you'll see what i mean
[Aug 13-06 2:10:30]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sorry, trap
[Aug 13-06 2:10:36]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is it usable now?
[Aug 13-06 2:10:46]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I think so
[Aug 13-06 2:10:50]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ wow
[Aug 13-06 2:13:40]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i blame you nulvect!

[Aug 13-06 2:14:4]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im sorta XPin right now..and it's your fault!
[Aug 13-06 2:14:12]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i want to see my new abil :(
[Aug 13-06 2:14:32]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i have a ? though
[Aug 13-06 2:14:36]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sure
[Aug 13-06 2:14:58]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if im in a different room, and i shoot someone and it's a law area...how does that work? or if it is in a []
[Aug 13-06 2:15:22]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ranged attacks cannot kill a person while they are in a different room
[Aug 13-06 2:15:34]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but can start combat..
[Aug 13-06 2:15:46]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not if anyone's in a peace room
[Aug 13-06 2:15:50]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Aug 13-06 2:16:4]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and say you leave the room before you kill someone...and then shoot
[Aug 13-06 2:16:10]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ would that be buggy?
[Aug 13-06 2:16:25]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ give it a try, I think I accounted for all possibilities
[Aug 13-06 2:16:30]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ or would it give you the kill and make you outlaw?
[Aug 13-06 2:16:36]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if anything works oddly, let me know
[Aug 13-06 2:16:40]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im not trying! im not going outlaw lol
[Aug 13-06 2:16:54]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you can't kill somebody while you're in another room, the arrow will miss
[Aug 13-06 2:17:8]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i saw that, on the guard in tenebrae
[Aug 13-06 2:17:16]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it missed when he was "dying"
[Aug 13-06 2:47:56]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i like it!
[Aug 13-06 2:50:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ good good

[Aug 13-06 3:4:27]Rocky %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hrm
[Aug 13-06 3:6:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah, but it's also used in the sense of ravaging a person
[Aug 13-06 3:6:19]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yes,  it can have a sexual meaning to it
[Aug 13-06 3:6:31]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ obviously...but so does finger
[Aug 13-06 3:6:31]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Rocky ravages too then.
[Aug 13-06 3:7:3]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and fondle, grope, stroke, and many other things
[Aug 13-06 3:7:9]Daos %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, but finger is known by all to not have any sexual connotation to it on pd
[Aug 13-06 3:7:23]Daos %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ravage is not, and it was not clear what your meaning of the word was
[Aug 13-06 3:7:27]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yes, and ravage i take as a very animalistic term
[Aug 13-06 3:7:41]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it only is Daos b/c that's what it is on here....and you dont take it sexually
[Aug 13-06 3:7:45]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ a LOT of others do
[Aug 13-06 3:8:27]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ when i said ravage i meant like to kill savagely until the end
[Aug 13-06 3:8:49]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not devouring a man in a sexual manner
[Aug 13-06 3:8:59]Daos %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yes, that is understood now but at the time it wasn't
[Aug 13-06 3:9:1]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not my fault ya'll cant think of anything but sex
[Aug 13-06 3:9:7]Daos %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you have used words sexually before
[Aug 13-06 3:9:29]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no kidding
[Aug 13-06 3:9:35]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that was never under ?
[Aug 13-06 3:9:57]Daos %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what makes you think we have only sex on our mind? that is pretty judgemental
[Aug 13-06 3:10:15]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, I think I'm going with thrust
[Aug 13-06 3:10:43]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and now you're assuming daos...im not talking to you about this anymore b/c im not caring to fight, which is what you're trying to do
[Aug 13-06 3:10:49]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thrust is overly used
[Aug 13-06 3:10:55]%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Carina sighs
[Aug 13-06 3:11:29]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's a boring name, but I can't find anything that sounds better
[Aug 13-06 3:12:29]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ tear?
[Aug 13-06 3:13:51]Daos %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'm not caring to fight at all carina, just was stating a fact that the context you used the word "ravage" in was not clear, that is all I have to say
[Aug 13-06 3:15:59]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ maybe I'll use spear instead, that makes me think of hunting more
[Aug 13-06 3:16:31]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ blitz, lunge, embed
[Aug 13-06 3:17:35]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ onslaught is a good one
[Aug 13-06 3:18:19]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Aug 13-06 3:36:15]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i love you nulvect!
[Aug 13-06 3:36:15]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i need to start makin stuff!
[Aug 13-06 3:36:27]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and did you like any names i gave you?
[Aug 13-06 3:37:11]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well I want to use slaughter for a berserker ability, so onslaught is a little too close for that.. lunge is already in use... blitz is so-so.. not decided on a name yet really
[Aug 13-06 3:37:37]Carina %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Aug 13-06 3:41:19]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ are items made by a ranger ever going to be autoloadable?
[Aug 13-06 3:41:25]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ or no?
[Aug 13-06 3:42:9]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nah
[Aug 13-06 3:42:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ probably not
[Aug 13-06 3:42:25]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not even arrows or quivers?
[Aug 13-06 3:42:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ arrows are tricky, they don't actually exist as an item anywhere
[Aug 13-06 3:43:1]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ aye
[Aug 13-06 3:43:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and you can just make a bow and a quiver when you first log on and use them til reboot, no big deal on that
[Aug 13-06 3:44:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ though, quivers will be getting a max arrow capacity when I get around to it
[Aug 13-06 3:44:49]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, if i have a quiver already, will the arrows i put into it al with it?
[Aug 13-06 3:44:57]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like my hunters quiver
[Aug 13-06 3:44:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not set up that way right now
[Aug 13-06 3:45:3]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Aug 13-06 3:45:29]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ do you only need wood for arrows?
[Aug 13-06 3:45:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ try it out
[Aug 13-06 3:46:34]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that would be a yes, i just made 15 arrows..is that right?
[Aug 13-06 3:47:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ with a single make??
[Aug 13-06 3:47:10]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yes
[Aug 13-06 3:47:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm, that might be a bit high
[Aug 13-06 3:47:34]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i agree
[Aug 13-06 3:47:40]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ which is why i brought it up
[Aug 13-06 3:47:46]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kind of a lot to get out of one stick of wood
[Aug 13-06 3:47:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ heh
[Aug 13-06 3:47:56]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well maybe
[Aug 13-06 3:48:0]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if it's a large one maybe
[Aug 13-06 3:48:14]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but yeah, agreed
[Aug 13-06 3:48:42]Rocky %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ any new weapons in the game yet?
[Aug 13-06 3:48:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ there, that should be a little more sane on the arrows
[Aug 13-06 3:49:10]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if you have not been on inferi island yes
[Aug 13-06 3:49:28]Rocky %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hrm darnit

[Aug 28-06 13:38:59]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hey bahamut, do you use rage much??
[Aug 28-06 13:39:7]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cant since your change
[Aug 28-06 13:39:15]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I dont kill players
[Aug 28-06 13:39:21]Hepualahaole %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I know aximili does
[Aug 28-06 13:39:29]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol so dont dare to use rage...besides it is not as effective
[Aug 28-06 13:39:37]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ how so??
[Aug 28-06 13:39:43]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I counted out exp rates
[Aug 28-06 13:39:55]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so rage u get sp to 20 after fight
[Aug 28-06 13:40:21]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no hewing within rage for my level, u have to do rub ointment e.t.c time wise it is pathetically uneffective
[Aug 28-06 13:40:41]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, the sp parts haven't changed
[Aug 28-06 13:40:51]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Pkilling wise it is unsmart so have not found use of it...aha...k will try then
[Aug 28-06 13:41:17]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mainly I just added in all (most??) abilities
[Aug 28-06 13:41:27]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ uh had 600 sp now I have 10 sp
[Aug 28-06 13:41:39]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ tried one mob...so sp thing have not changed for me I think
[Aug 28-06 13:41:57]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ rage puts you at the same sp it always has
[Aug 28-06 13:42:13]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ didn't change that part
[Aug 28-06 13:42:29]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ though, I may rework how it chooses abilities
[Aug 28-06 13:43:7]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Yeah either hew is overpowered or rage is underpowered in either case it is real ineffective have been toggling and working and experimenting with rage a lot never found any use of it except that I had pickpick meeting with Death from time to time thanks to it lol
[Aug 28-06 13:43:57]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ So me think it should be looked into again maybe...it takes just too much time to use rage and the benefits from it is not that great ( at lower levels)
[Aug 28-06 13:43:59]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ pickpick??
[Aug 28-06 13:44:7]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ picknick meeting sorry
[Aug 28-06 13:44:11]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh picnic
[Aug 28-06 13:44:23]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ aha sorry swedish here hehe...my english sucks sometimes..
[Aug 28-06 13:44:27]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ k, well that's on my list for when I get to berserkers
[Aug 28-06 13:45:23]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I am willing to report of any experience I have if u like....but my main suggestion would be the sp thing to make rage more efficient.
[Aug 28-06 14:2:1]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ regardind rage..the part with sp dropping down to 10 after a fight makes rage exp wise useless in longer terms.
[Aug 28-06 14:2:19]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I disagree
[Aug 28-06 14:2:39]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hehe...do you want me to show how to outexp you? on equal terms?
[Aug 28-06 14:3:37]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it may be so at higher levels but in lower level as my level it is not like that
[Aug 28-06 14:4:19]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I can see possibly the want for higher level abilities in rage at your level, but the sp part is not an issue
[Aug 28-06 14:4:33]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I raged my berserker from 10 to 31 and sp was never a problem
[Aug 28-06 14:5:37]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well the thing is as a player one look for the most efficient abilities and if u found that rage was the best ability for you to exp with then I am impressed.
[Aug 28-06 14:6:31]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ or I am the one being stupid who have not found it efficient enough.
[Aug 28-06 14:7:7]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ think about it this way, you can not use rage, and rub 2-3 ointments at the end of the fight, or you can use rage and rub 1 ointment
[Aug 28-06 14:7:41]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ as for damage during the fight, well, I'll look into that when the time comes
[Aug 28-06 14:7:59]Aldhissla %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sacrifice some corpses, you'll get about 10 sp per corpse?
[Aug 28-06 14:8:9]Bahamut %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ k k
[Aug 28-06 14:8:59]Aldhissla %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i dont know, but im xping faster without rage :)
[Aug 28-06 14:9:27]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not a lot of good melee abils in yet, that's why
[Aug 28-06 14:9:41]Aldhissla %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Gore going to be added?
[Aug 28-06 14:9:47]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not sure
[Aug 28-06 14:10:3]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the way it's set up, it would be hard to add
[Aug 28-06 15:19:10]Ketron %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm what to be what to be... zerker? anti?

[Aug 28-06 15:21:8]Ketron %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ dunnno if they are charisma str dex or in/wis based
[Aug 28-06 15:21:32]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ shrug, just advocating them because I'm working on them right now :P
[Aug 28-06 15:22:2]Ketron %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, what Nully wants, Nully gets...

[Aug 30-06 21:5:24]%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Daos that shouldn't be an emote

[Sep 4-06 14:47:42]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it'll be even better once I get specific warrior abils in
[Sep 4-06 14:47:46]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ helps cuz i can charge wif a 2handed blunt
[Sep 4-06 14:48:0]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and you cant really charge wif blunts so the starscream in my hand helps
[Sep 4-06 14:48:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ warriors will have a bunch of moves that use two different kinds of weapons together
[Sep 4-06 14:49:2]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oo
[Sep 4-06 14:49:8]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so I figured a little help on wielding two weapons would be good
[Sep 4-06 14:49:28]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ idk which one of you imms does this, but we need some more blunts in the game :/
[Sep 4-06 14:49:36]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and flails
[Sep 4-06 14:50:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that's really area coders
[Sep 4-06 14:50:14]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ahh
[Sep 4-06 14:50:26]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ who implements the areas
[Sep 4-06 14:53:46]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, whit and stormy are the ones who approve areas and put them into the game, but daos is in charge of builder's and doing initial walkthroughs
[Sep 4-06 14:54:4]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah
[Sep 4-06 14:54:28]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol explains why ironmans area never will go in
[Sep 4-06 14:54:32]Hepualahaole %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ which btw, he will be busy for the next couple of weeks working
[Sep 4-06 14:54:44]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oo
[Sep 4-06 14:54:52]Ichago %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ parry strike blocks the next attack and hits the enemy with the other sword
[Sep 4-06 14:55:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sorry, that's called riposte
[Sep 4-06 14:55:6]Hepualahaole %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ironman's area... you need to know the whole story
[Sep 4-06 14:55:10]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah ichago
[Sep 4-06 14:55:18]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol too many bugs in it?
[Sep 4-06 14:55:22]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'll make parry useful though
[Sep 4-06 14:55:34]Ichago %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah

[Sep 4-06 18:7:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so do you like it when people talk like this and don't have any breaks between what they say andy ou have to read a whole screenful and it's really annoying because it's hard to tell where one idea ends and the next begins because they didnt bother to use periods or commas or even apostrophes and probably cant even spell apostrophe and it makes my eyes hurt trying to decipher it is why I dont like it
[Sep 4-06 18:7:42]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hrm
[Sep 4-06 18:7:48]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i should remake zabuza and fix that post then :p

[Sep 4-06 18:9:52]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sorry about the punctuations and stuff but i got lazy too much to type :P
[Sep 4-06 18:10:20]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ guess I never did post what direction I wanted to take fighters in
[Sep 4-06 18:10:26]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ noep

[Sep 4-06 18:13:57]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Rohl did 2k to me
[Sep 4-06 18:14:37]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well rohl does have more stats than you
[Sep 4-06 18:15:7]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ its just that i noticed it became slightly more harder to snap mobs but easier on ppl :p
[Sep 4-06 18:15:41]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ its a nuisance i dont see why my hack can chop off heads then to isnta ppl :p
[Sep 4-06 18:15:47]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Swiss was just kidding about that.
[Sep 4-06 18:24:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok, summary posted
[Sep 4-06 18:26:1]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you're the man nul
[Sep 4-06 18:26:29]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ funny i found a couple of old mails between you and i with me sayin dude you need to become a f'in imm :P
[Sep 4-06 18:30:16]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ heh
[Sep 4-06 18:36:22]Ichago %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what skill is a whip under
[Sep 4-06 18:36:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ flail
[Sep 4-06 18:36:40]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ discern it
[Sep 4-06 18:37:20]Ichago %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so I need to train flail to get that new abil?
[Sep 5-06 17:54:10]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ On the fighter side....does anyone know when the black swords/whatever sword that's better than Starscream auto's?
[Sep 6-06 0:25:32]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i would really like a response to that post doesnt have to be now but just letting ya know cuz im a bit worried
[Sep 6-06 0:26:24]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I mean for warriors to use a weapon in each hand, so while they can wield 2-handed weapons, that's not really what they'll be doing
[Sep 6-06 0:26:46]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so it would be two one handed weapons ='ing two? :p
[Sep 6-06 0:26:58]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i dont quite get what your saying :/
[Sep 6-06 0:27:6]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ give me an example
[Sep 6-06 0:27:14]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ warrior.. sword in one hand.. axe in the other
[Sep 6-06 0:27:18]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ahhh
[Sep 6-06 0:27:28]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but the problem is
[Sep 6-06 0:27:30]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ replace sword and axe with any kind of weapons
[Sep 6-06 0:27:36]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not many good axes to use at higher lvls
[Sep 6-06 0:27:46]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Kazuma nods.
[Sep 6-06 0:27:50]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im comparing starscream to every axe/cleaver i get and there aint none
[Sep 6-06 0:27:52]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Kazuma agrees with Swiss.
[Sep 6-06 0:27:54]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thats better
[Sep 6-06 0:28:6]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ weapons are up the area builders
[Sep 6-06 0:28:8]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ unless and until there are better weapons in the game that system would be tight
[Sep 6-06 0:28:8]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the==to
[Sep 6-06 0:28:36]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thats the problem we need a board for those builders and we should get info on what they are working on currently so we can post our ideas and they can implement them
[Sep 6-06 0:28:50]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and they can use those ideas and put it in their area
[Sep 6-06 0:28:54]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Well...as is I'm tired of the not-so-many xp areas for lower levels. I gotta fight off Jagermister and a lot of toher people for xp
[Sep 6-06 0:29:6]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like atm it would be retarded to fight with any other weapon than a axe or a sword cuz i cant charge
[Sep 6-06 0:29:12]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if i wield a flail i cant charge
[Sep 6-06 0:29:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you are not "lower level", kazuma
[Sep 6-06 0:29:22]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Well...mid lvls then :)
[Sep 6-06 0:29:28]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ haven't gotten to charge yet, swiss
[Sep 6-06 0:29:40]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ SOrry for giving you such a hard time Nul :(
[Sep 6-06 0:29:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but you still won't be able to charge with a whip, that's just dumb
[Sep 6-06 0:30:3]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but you should charge with a pike
[Sep 6-06 0:30:7]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yep
[Sep 6-06 0:30:37]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and theres another problem once you fix up warriors and there is no guild two handed stuff, how would i xp?
[Sep 6-06 0:30:43]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not guild minus that
[Sep 6-06 0:30:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what do you mean no two-handed stuff??
[Sep 6-06 0:31:3]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like wielding a axe in one hand and a sword in another
[Sep 6-06 0:31:13]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ id rather just wield two starscreams
[Sep 6-06 0:31:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not if you have an ability that does more damage if you're using an axe
[Sep 6-06 0:32:15]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ alright i get it so it aint the weapon necessarily just the abil itself
[Sep 6-06 0:32:19]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ It'd be cool if you made weapon combo moves. Like if a warrior is wielding a whip and an axe the warrior can whip at the monster/whatever, pull them in and then hack them in one turn.
[Sep 6-06 0:32:31]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mind the spelling*
[Sep 6-06 0:32:51]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i think thats what nulvect's idea is
[Sep 6-06 0:32:57]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Oh.
[Sep 6-06 0:32:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that's exactly what my idea is for warriors
[Sep 6-06 0:33:1]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol
[Sep 6-06 0:33:5]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Well. That's just pimp :)
[Sep 6-06 0:33:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that's why they have their special wield ability even
[Sep 6-06 0:33:37]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ okay that makes all sense now :p
[Sep 6-06 0:33:43]Swiss %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it hit me like a light
[Sep 6-06 0:33:47]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ That rocks hardcore
[Sep 6-06 18:39:29]Endy %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is valor in use?

[Sep 6-06 18:41:3]Endy %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ compared to what im use to :P
[Sep 6-06 18:41:29]Endy %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i still think its funny im exping with cripple
[Sep 6-06 18:41:29]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ attack, faith, healing, blade, (valor)
[Sep 6-06 18:41:53]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cripple was ok but I didn't get any int/wis

[Sep 7-06 0:14:0]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ then there's already been a vote on what to do after gypsy. So after that Palidins may have a chance.
[Sep 7-06 0:14:44]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I am still taking votes, but read my post before you try voting

[Sep 12-06 23:45:26]Jorgan %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i wonder if it adds rounds

[Sep 13-06 13:7:19]Jorgan %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ heya nul
[Sep 13-06 13:7:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hey
[Sep 13-06 13:7:51]Jorgan %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i did some more thinking :P
[Sep 13-06 13:8:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ any of it directed at gypsies??
[Sep 13-06 13:8:49]Jorgan %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ got a few ideas for gypsies
[Sep 13-06 13:9:21]Jorgan %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ a dance with a sword :P
[Sep 13-06 13:9:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ we used to have one, then it got changed into a knife dance, then I changed it into the twining of nine tails
[Sep 15-06 12:56:46]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hey nul, what you think of dahlia's post?
[Sep 15-06 12:59:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ don't remember what it was
[Sep 15-06 12:59:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh, herbs
[Sep 15-06 12:59:38]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I fully plan to make more kinds of herbs and make them useful
[Sep 15-06 12:59:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ applying them to arrows... that part is difficult
[Sep 15-06 13:0:10]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i remember you saying that, but I was more asking about the last part
[Sep 15-06 13:0:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ making a talisman seems more of a magical thing to me
[Sep 15-06 13:0:50]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but it deals with nature, which is why i thought I would ask, b/c I thought it was kinda creative and would work
[Sep 15-06 13:1:50]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ rangers don't use magic, but I think it's a fine idea for a magical class
[Sep 15-06 13:2:40]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i understand that we don't use magic, but I also see where it could fit rangers, b/c it deals with the magics of nature, which we do have
[Sep 15-06 13:2:48]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that is why i asked what you thought
[Sep 15-06 13:2:52]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thanks
[Sep 15-06 13:3:42]Nulvect %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ a ranger's nature skill isn't magic-related, it's knowledge-related
[Sep 15-06 13:4:22]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods- but if you look at it in a old native american way... the knowledge of nature is the fuel for the fire when it comes to some magics
[Sep 15-06 13:4:42]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they lived they're lives around their "totum"
[Sep 15-06 13:5:14]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm, that would be cool
[Sep 15-06 13:5:38]Nulvect %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I've had some ideas for a shaman subclass and I think the talisman thing would fit perfectly in there
[Sep 15-06 13:6:0]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ rather then have a talisman..have a totum, which you can chose or do some sort of quest to decide what your totum should be.
[Sep 15-06 13:6:6]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that could be cool
[Sep 15-06 13:6:14]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok sorry, i know you were busy
[Sep 15-06 13:6:22]Nulvect %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm, decent ideas
[Sep 15-06 13:7:12]Nulvect %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you should post or mudmail that so I can stea..uh, use it.. later on
[Sep 15-06 13:7:22]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ then with the totum you are more inclinded to be good in a specific stat or something..where it's like a little or something
[Sep 15-06 13:7:24]Carina %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kk
[Sep 15-06 13:14:10]Nulvect %^GREEN%^BOLD%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thanks

[Sep 30-06 16:11:25]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ the problem with grappling moves is that they would be hard to actually use vs anyone with a weapon
[Sep 30-06 16:11:53]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ plus armour would really make them ineffective
[Sep 30-06 16:12:13]Uri %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ooo oke
[Sep 30-06 16:12:33]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'll still listen to the ideas, though

[Oct 8-06 3:56:49]Kilrog %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ whats the go with all the new abils? I was told they were a new one every 100 skills points in that weapon type?
[Oct 8-06 22:54:18]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hey nul, i have 2 questions
[Oct 8-06 22:54:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I may have 1.84 answers
[Oct 8-06 22:55:12]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ 1 - Have you looked at that spell i did yet? and 2 - is "sneak" able to be used for abilities? or only movements?
[Oct 8-06 22:56:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ 1, I scanned it really quickly; 2, it is possible that it affects abilities but each ability it affects has to be specially made to look for it so.. not many at the moment
[Oct 8-06 22:59:15]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods- was just checkin on both.  wanted to see if sneak worked on abils and saw it didnt tis why i asked
[Oct 8-06 22:59:37]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cuz sneak is stupid
[Oct 9-06 3:29:47]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh my now the hard one warrior or ranger
[Oct 9-06 14:26:17]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ are rangers good wif spears?
[Oct 9-06 14:28:57]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ best with swords
[Oct 9-06 14:28:57]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but we have a spear abil
[Oct 9-06 14:29:29]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is there another fighter type thats better in spears?
[Oct 9-06 14:29:35]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i love using spears
[Oct 9-06 14:31:17]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nope, I'm not sure what all nulvect is planning for rangers though, it would make most sense for them to be best at spears, so i would ask him about it
[Oct 9-06 14:33:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ look at your skill maxes, that should tell you what I have planned
[Oct 9-06 14:33:51]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ go ranged
[Oct 9-06 14:34:17]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ imma have to MAX that once i'm done gettin what im doing
[Oct 9-06 14:34:25]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ maybe then my barrage and shoot would be better eh? ;)
[Oct 9-06 14:36:23]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ranged sounds fun
[Oct 9-06 14:36:41]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ill work on that projectile and blade then
[Oct 9-06 14:39:43]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ question: how are the wc of swords vs spears here?
[Oct 9-06 14:40:11]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ about the same?
[Oct 9-06 14:40:39]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they range
[Oct 9-06 14:40:45]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so as you get bigger you use something better
[Oct 9-06 14:41:5]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ most fighters get "compare" so you can see what weapon has a better wc
[Oct 9-06 15:11:32]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so is there a fighter guild here?
[Oct 9-06 15:11:50]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no, we dont go by what we are, we go by what type of char we are
[Oct 9-06 15:11:54]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ good or bad
[Oct 9-06 15:11:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ guilds are like clubs
[Oct 9-06 15:11:56]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ darksouls sound like a rogue guild
[Oct 9-06 15:12:22]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ darksouls is not a rogue guild, it's an evil guild, that has many races/classes in it
[Oct 9-06 15:12:30]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ any good ones?
[Oct 9-06 15:12:34]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ first thing you need to do is help guild list
[Oct 9-06 15:12:46]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ then look at each guild and see which you think best suits you
[Oct 9-06 15:12:48]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh your a leader
[Oct 9-06 15:12:54]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ then talk to the leader of that guild, yes I am
[Oct 9-06 15:13:32]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lemme read all of this Last Saints sound cool, do you guys war alot? i just like havin fun thats why
[Oct 9-06 15:13:54]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i dont war to well
[Oct 9-06 15:13:58]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no, we don't war a lot
[Oct 9-06 15:14:4]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Carina doesnt like war.
[Oct 9-06 15:14:18]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but we do PK on occasions
[Oct 9-06 15:16:36]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ player killing?
[Oct 9-06 15:16:42]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Oct 9-06 15:16:42]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is that required of guilds?
[Oct 9-06 15:16:48]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ some of them
[Oct 9-06 15:25:41]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ do last saints require playerkilling?
[Oct 9-06 16:20:43]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ My skills say ..... Nature            27  (5%)  55 You do not have magic skills.
[Oct 9-06 16:21:17]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ If I have nature dont I have a magic skill
[Oct 9-06 16:22:37]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ are druids magic based?
[Oct 9-06 16:22:49]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they sound like fun too
[Oct 9-06 16:22:49]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yes
[Oct 9-06 16:28:55]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ type abilities and spells and see if any look like they use nature
[Oct 9-06 16:32:29]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no spells
[Oct 9-06 16:32:45]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I think there is something that armors with mud
[Oct 9-06 16:32:47]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but its on my skills list
[Oct 9-06 16:33:1]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mudarmor
[Oct 9-06 16:33:19]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ probably other things that use it but I don't know what you get
[Oct 9-06 16:34:5]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ never mind my skills list is buged
[Oct 9-06 16:39:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no it's not, ranger nature is knowledge of nature lore
[Oct 9-06 16:40:16]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ druid nature is nature magic
[Oct 9-06 16:41:2]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but why is it on the side with magic?
[Oct 9-06 16:41:36]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no other place to put it???
[Oct 9-06 16:42:20]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well i guess cause that section is actually just for subclass focused abilitiies, not so much magic itslef
[Oct 9-06 16:42:56]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok hey do rangers get any really cool moves
[Oct 9-06 16:43:32]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no idea friend, this is my first char
[Oct 9-06 16:43:48]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so far i have pierce shoot and cut for weapon abils
[Oct 9-06 16:44:24]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ weapon abils are for all class
[Oct 9-06 16:44:42]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ okay
[Oct 9-06 16:44:48]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sorry im a newbie
[Oct 9-06 16:44:52]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just saying
[Oct 9-06 16:45:34]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mudarmor saids good but where do I get mud
[Oct 9-06 16:45:56]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ think you have to forge it
[Oct 9-06 16:46:18]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok
[Oct 9-06 16:46:46]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ are centaurs better than humans?
[Oct 9-06 16:46:54]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i should have been a centaur huh
[Oct 9-06 16:46:58]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ seems like alot of them
[Oct 9-06 16:47:42]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ centaur takes a round less to charge and is much more annoying to armour
[Oct 9-06 16:48:2]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh
[Oct 9-06 16:49:6]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I like humans more but everyones all says centaurs this and that because of charge
[Oct 9-06 16:49:34]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well I don't like centaurs but I'm not big on humans either
[Oct 9-06 16:49:56]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well hopefully i made the right choice :)
[Oct 9-06 16:50:2]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ by going human
[Oct 9-06 16:51:0]Crazylegs %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ most people don't like humans because they have balanced stats where as your class uses certain stats more than others
[Oct 9-06 17:48:34]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I tamed a chipmunk now what?
[Oct 9-06 17:48:58]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ command chipmunk to attack victor
[Oct 9-06 17:49:0]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ can you have it attack something
[Oct 9-06 17:50:4]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Can I make it follow me aroud
[Oct 9-06 17:55:25]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I kill it *cry*
[Oct 9-06 17:55:35]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ NNNOOOOO
[Oct 9-06 17:56:9]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ One headbutt and its brains were everywhere
[Oct 9-06 18:1:24]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ fun
[Oct 9-06 21:28:26]Siksika %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ we cannot charge with spears?
[Oct 9-06 21:38:32]Siksika %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so sword abilities are better than spear?
[Oct 9-06 21:38:56]Crazylegs %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ throw seems to be the best ability and is independent of weapon abilities
[Oct 9-06 21:39:12]Siksika %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i havent tried throw just yet
[Oct 9-06 22:54:23]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Ruci bows
[Oct 9-06 22:54:27]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Carina bows back.
[Oct 10-06 3:51:1]Oderus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ welcome

[Oct 10-06 3:51:33]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ your not new here are you Hannibal
[Oct 10-06 3:51:41]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i think i remember this name along time ago
[Oct 10-06 3:51:57]Hannibal %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ actually, i am
[Oct 10-06 3:51:57]Oderus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i remember the movie
[Oct 10-06 3:54:22]Hannibal %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i just joined about 10 minutes ago as scipio and went about finding the class halls
[Oct 10-06 3:54:48]Hannibal %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ finally decided on fighter but scipio, being an elf wasn't very fitting to be a fighter
[Oct 10-06 3:54:58]Oderus %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ elves are pretty good
[Oct 10-06 17:28:6]Siksika %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ since we are unable to charge without swords (non spear/projectile weapons ) do we get joust or something like that?
[Oct 12-06 21:31:31]Rylde %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is there any other raknid armour around here other than the hardned caccoon?
[Oct 14-06 2:28:37]Rylde %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ anyone know some armour raknids can use?
[Oct 14-06 2:28:47]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ raknid armour
[Oct 14-06 2:29:17]Rylde %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ any specific names?
[Oct 14-06 2:29:55]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ask on newbie, get a better answer
[Oct 14-06 23:33:48]Rylde %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i have 4 dark cutlasses, i can wield the first one but when i type wield cutlass 2-4 it says You do not have the talent to use that weapon
[Oct 14-06 23:34:20]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ could be sharpened
[Oct 14-06 23:34:32]Rylde %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Oct 14-06 23:34:44]Rylde %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yea thats it.
[Oct 17-06 21:56:22]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so warriors can sharen, pallies can bless, what can antis do?

[Oct 20-06 12:53:11]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods
[Oct 20-06 12:53:45]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ right now slash is better than warblade by like 50 damage
[Oct 20-06 12:53:59]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ headbutt is probably even better than that
[Oct 20-06 12:54:13]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mine does 0
[Oct 20-06 12:54:37]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh you're a warrior
[Oct 20-06 12:54:43]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods
[Oct 21-06 16:14:57]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hrmm i can wield once cutlass but not another?
[Oct 21-06 16:15:5]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ is the other sharpened?
[Oct 21-06 16:15:11]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nope
[Oct 21-06 16:15:13]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Kazuma ponders.
[Oct 21-06 16:15:27]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no idea, i remember as the old fighter it would do that to me sometimes as well.
[Oct 21-06 16:15:27]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ tries to think but farts instead
[Oct 21-06 17:28:33]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ heya cari, i know what you said about not giving out your character info, but are your bow moves good?
[Oct 21-06 17:37:19]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hrm...so angel ranger wasn't a great idea.
[Oct 21-06 17:39:21]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ emote scratches that idea off
[Oct 21-06 17:39:31]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ bah
[Oct 21-06 17:39:49]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Yang kicks his aliases
[Oct 21-06 17:39:51]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what kinda fighter would angel be good at? also thinking about staying lvl 19 to stat.

[Nov 2-06 1:31:14]Ying %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i wonder if Stun should be only for zerkerz and upgraded since its a melee hit, just my 2 cents
[Nov 2-06 1:32:2]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah stun is something I'm planning to mess with, not sure exactly how yet
[Nov 2-06 1:32:12]Ying %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kool
[Nov 4-06 17:25:41]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ fixed, sabado, can't skin or gut those anymore
[Nov 4-06 17:25:49]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if you have any skin of sinew left from them, just bury it
[Nov 4-06 17:25:55]Sabado %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ awesome, thanks Nul
[Nov 4-06 17:26:19]Sabado %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ done
[Nov 4-06 17:37:51]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ meow
[Nov 7-06 12:34:37]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ has mysticblade been changed at all?
[Nov 7-06 12:34:43]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not sure
[Nov 7-06 12:35:3]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ *bash head
[Nov 7-06 12:35:19]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I can't believe I still don't get the max rank mysticblade
[Nov 7-06 12:35:43]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ when they realized lvl 90 paladins could mysticblade something better than a dragonslayer, they changed it
[Nov 7-06 12:35:51]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ umm
[Nov 7-06 12:36:13]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and a level 100?
[Nov 7-06 12:36:21]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I can kill the drow general solo no problem
[Nov 7-06 12:36:29]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and dragon slayers autload at a very low level
[Nov 7-06 12:36:37]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Nov 7-06 12:36:59]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hte dslayer is a level 50 weapon
[Nov 7-06 12:37:11]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yhea, they don't want lvl 90+ pally's running with that kind of power? *shrug*
[Nov 7-06 12:37:13]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hell, this mysticblade doesn't even have the weapon class of a starscream
[Nov 7-06 12:37:43]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's still dumb, that a class ability at level 100 is worse than the swords you can get at level50
[Nov 7-06 12:37:45]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ which autoloads at what...35
[Nov 7-06 12:37:57]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh, at level35 you can buy them
[Nov 7-06 12:38:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mysticblade is a pre-hm spell, you believe that being a high level should mean you can make the best swords in the game??
[Nov 7-06 12:39:5]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but he spell scales with your skill
[Nov 7-06 12:39:21]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ a hm paladincan't make a great weapon
[Nov 7-06 12:39:35]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ even if there weren't a limit on it
[Nov 7-06 12:39:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ different things scale at different rates and some have caps
[Nov 7-06 12:39:47]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ by lvl 100, you've been using dragon slayers since level 35
[Nov 7-06 12:40:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'll look into it, but I guarantee that weapons people can get with zero effort at any time will never be the strongest around
[Nov 7-06 12:40:53]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ zero effort?
[Nov 7-06 12:40:57]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ getting to level 100?
[Nov 7-06 12:41:7]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ typing "mysticblade" and waiting a few seconds
[Nov 7-06 12:42:1]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's no more hassle than getting a dragonslayer *once*
[Nov 7-06 12:42:9]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ at which point it autoloads forever
[Nov 7-06 12:42:17]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ perhaps at your level
[Nov 7-06 12:42:33]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it isn't like it's bound to you, people can always buy them at lvl35
[Nov 7-06 12:42:45]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ or ask a big friend to get it for them
[Nov 7-06 12:42:51]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and if they get it once, they've got it forever
[Nov 7-06 12:42:53]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ anyway
[Nov 7-06 12:43:1]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ my original point was that you can get an avenger
[Nov 7-06 12:43:9]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and you can get an avenger (glowing)
[Nov 7-06 12:43:31]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ maybe a higher ranking version of mysticblade?
[Nov 7-06 12:43:33]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ at lvl100, I still have a good chance of getting a standard avenger. It seems... silly
[Nov 7-06 12:43:37]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like an elite only version?
[Nov 7-06 12:44:7]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ possibly only wielded by the maker?
[Nov 7-06 12:45:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Nov 7-06 12:46:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'll put this stuff on my list, not sure when I'll get to it though.. maybe tomorrow, maybe after necros
[Nov 7-06 12:46:37]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's not urgent, it's just a silly design thing
[Nov 7-06 12:46:55]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ why is it that an ability doesn't cap out by lvl100?
[Nov 7-06 12:47:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ don't ask me, I didn't write it
[Nov 7-06 12:48:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ some people like to keep an element of randomness in so that even at high levels you get a bit of change... though that can also be frustrating
[Nov 7-06 12:48:33]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ annoying with mysticblade, because if you miss out on your top rank, you just gotta bury it and try again
[Nov 7-06 12:48:39]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just makes it tedious
[Nov 7-06 12:48:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I know I didn't like it when summon would fail at random 30 levels after it stopped being usefull
[Nov 7-06 12:49:1]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah, things like that are a bit much
[Nov 7-06 12:49:15]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they could add wisdom and int to the code to enhance your abilities to get an elite avenger also
[Nov 7-06 12:49:31]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ how many paladins have high int wis...most have what, 100 top?
[Nov 7-06 12:49:43]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ 101 :P
[Nov 7-06 12:56:11]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ headbutt is one of my strongest moves
[Nov 7-06 12:56:31]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I find mine is pretty cost efficient.
[Nov 7-06 12:56:37]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sp wise
[Nov 7-06 12:57:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah headbutt needs to be looked at, it really should be more on par with slash
[Nov 7-06 12:57:53]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ heh, maul got nurfed
[Nov 7-06 12:57:59]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ err, nerfed
[Nov 7-06 12:59:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nothing under "weapons" got nerfed, those are all new abilities
[Nov 7-06 12:59:39]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well when it got redone it wasn't made as good as it was before then
[Nov 7-06 12:59:59]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol@maul
[Nov 7-06 13:0:5]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I can tell you guys a story about maul
[Nov 7-06 13:0:47]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ before maul had a stipulation in the code that added the users attack skill to the weapon code
[Nov 7-06 13:1:14]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so everytime you mauled something, the WC of a weapon would increase by your attack skill
[Nov 7-06 13:1:24]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ crazy
[Nov 7-06 13:1:26]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yhea, I crashed the mud a few times
[Nov 7-06 13:1:44]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I just liked it when I could keep stunning creatures 40 levels below me
[Nov 7-06 13:1:54]Mondo %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol
[Nov 7-06 13:2:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ paladins will have better blunt moves, once I get to them
[Nov 7-06 13:3:20]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ can I smite people when their health is below 2/3 of my smite damage?
[Nov 7-06 13:3:36]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that depends on how you define your "smite damage"
[Nov 7-06 13:3:54]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what did it hit you for sabado?
[Nov 7-06 13:4:12]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you didnt hit me til I was below 1/3 my hp...round 400hp
[Nov 7-06 13:4:26]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and it took you to... ?
[Nov 7-06 13:4:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ smite and coupe and snap and anything meant to kill on that hit purposely do 2 or 3 times more damage than they figure to make sure the target dies
[Nov 7-06 13:4:40]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ -1900 or so?
[Nov 7-06 13:4:48]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ dont remember specifically
[Nov 7-06 13:5:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ smite and coupe will definitely be looked at, but probably not in that order
[Nov 7-06 13:6:26]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it was just silly, I couldn't use it until my opponent was under 400 hp somewhere
[Nov 7-06 13:6:34]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I nearly killed him with idle attacks
[Nov 7-06 13:6:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ shrug
[Nov 7-06 13:6:50]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ does alignment determine damage on that one?
[Nov 7-06 13:7:16]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ my problem there is that on creatures, I might be able to use it when they are on say... 1k hp, but then my warblade does that much damage anyway
[Nov 7-06 13:7:18]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you know it was made the way it is because of pk concerns
[Nov 7-06 13:7:46]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh, well if it does it just for pk that's ok, but it'd be nice if it could be used on any creature during it's last 30%, or whatever dying is
[Nov 7-06 13:7:58]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ regardless of whether it would kill or not
[Nov 7-06 13:8:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I remember many fighters could attack someone and coupe and boom, dead
[Nov 7-06 13:8:6]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hehe
[Nov 7-06 13:8:28]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ only if they had under 1700 hp, and even then you had to be very, very high level
[Nov 7-06 13:8:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ 1700 hp is pretty high for most, especially non-fighters
[Nov 7-06 13:9:18]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well people have less hjp now
[Nov 7-06 13:9:42]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Sabado also thinks xp cuts influence many to stay smaller.
[Nov 7-06 13:10:8]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah, 35 to 37 was a sweet spot
[Nov 7-06 13:10:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ anyway, berserkers are coming up soonish, so coupe will probably get a look while I do them, and I can probably mess with smite at the same time
[Nov 7-06 13:10:24]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I held on at lvl65 for a while
[Nov 7-06 13:10:32]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ to get full exp from the dragons cave
[Nov 7-06 13:10:46]Aziraphale %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ then I saved up 1.4 billion exp, and levelled all the way to 100 ^_^
[Nov 7-06 13:10:56]Sabado %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ wow

[Nov 18-06 13:58:9]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, someone came up with an ability that gives you a temporary hp/max hp boost, and I thought that would be interesting and useful
[Nov 18-06 13:58:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and I have a plan for a multi-hitting melee ability
[Nov 18-06 13:58:21]Quin %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that sounds sweet
[Nov 18-06 13:58:27]Skrymer %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh, that sounds awesome

[Dec 9-06 20:30:37]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lifetap isn't around anymore
[Dec 9-06 20:30:43]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im just saying
[Dec 9-06 20:30:51]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it doesnt have to be exactly that
[Dec 9-06 20:31:3]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just a spell that steals hp basically
[Dec 9-06 20:31:7]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so, absorb
[Dec 9-06 20:31:9]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no
[Dec 9-06 20:31:11]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Dec 9-06 20:32:3]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmmm, maybe
[Dec 9-06 20:32:19]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i posted up a lil more info bout it on antipali board
[Dec 9-06 20:33:35]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmmmmm... what about an ability involving an actual whip that lets you steal hp??
[Dec 9-06 20:33:59]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like sort of like mysticblade a whip that does that?
[Dec 9-06 20:34:9]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that sounds awesome actually
[Dec 9-06 20:34:21]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no, an ability that can be used with a whip
[Dec 9-06 20:34:29]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oo that sounds even better
[Dec 9-06 20:34:51]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ infusing whips with a spell = very cool to me
[Dec 9-06 20:35:11]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ idea idea
[Dec 9-06 20:35:25]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ how about antipaladins could infuse their weapons with a spell and a power to steal life \
[Dec 9-06 20:35:35]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ with an added weapon special
[Dec 9-06 20:35:37]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that is much harder, actually
[Dec 9-06 20:35:43]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nod probably
[Dec 9-06 20:35:45]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ :P
[Dec 9-06 20:35:49]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol
[Dec 9-06 20:36:1]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ paladins should get one that gives life, the exact opposite :p
[Dec 9-06 20:36:23]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it would give life
[Dec 9-06 20:36:33]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it would 'steal' it, making it yours :P
[Dec 9-06 20:36:43]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i dint wanna use the word "steal" to make it sound all holy like :P
[Dec 9-06 20:37:1]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but then realized what i was saying was the same for antipaladins lol :p
[Dec 9-06 20:37:25]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ actually.. hmm let me look into it...
[Dec 9-06 20:37:33]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im glad i maxed my ferocity lol :P
[Dec 9-06 20:37:45]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ might be able to change weapon specials...
[Dec 9-06 20:37:51]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oo
[Dec 9-06 20:38:3]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ maybe *coughs* make bolas autoload at *coughs lvl 34 :P

[Dec 9-06 20:39:53]Eliytres %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cuz bolas auto'ing at lvl 45 is soo not cool :P
[Dec 10-06 18:30:3]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ tame was taken away!
[Dec 10-06 18:30:11]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ :(
[Dec 10-06 18:30:27]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thats kind of gay
[Dec 10-06 18:30:43]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ eh, i was plannin on coding a new tame
[Dec 10-06 18:30:47]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ when i hit 20, rush took 6 rounds to kill something that used to take 4
[Dec 10-06 18:30:49]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ we'll see if nul likes it
[Dec 10-06 18:31:17]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ since nulvect fixed how slash did that, he'll probably fix rush's too, right?
[Dec 10-06 18:31:27]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ idk, you'd have to ask him
[Dec 10-06 18:31:49]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ive been waiting for hi all afternoon :(
[Dec 10-06 21:40:32]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you know how daboura fked slash up and made it get weaker at level 20
[Dec 10-06 21:40:34]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ rush does the same thing
[Dec 10-06 21:40:52]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and i likeed rush before it started sucking at level 20
[Dec 10-06 21:41:8]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ vian
[Dec 10-06 21:41:16]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ya carcar
[Dec 10-06 21:41:16]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ stop complaining
[Dec 10-06 21:41:22]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im just asking him if he can fix it
[Dec 10-06 21:41:40]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ because abilities arent supposed to get weaker just cause you go from 19 to 20.  it should be the opposite if anything
[Dec 10-06 21:41:44]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ b/c you know...he doesnt have a million other things on his list
[Dec 10-06 21:41:48]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ wait your turn
[Dec 10-06 21:41:52]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well its easy to take the little bit of code out of rush
[Dec 10-06 21:41:58]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ to make it stay the same at 20
[Dec 10-06 21:42:10]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im not asking him to totally recode anything
[Dec 10-06 21:43:22]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i know, but still..he's one person, if you want something i know that I would prefer it to be in a nice way rahter than in a whinning do it b/c it sucks way...if i were him
[Dec 10-06 21:43:26]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ tis all im saying
[Dec 10-06 21:43:36]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ *nods*
[Dec 10-06 21:44:22]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ know what i mean though?
[Dec 10-06 21:44:34]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ wouldnt you prefer someone doing it in a more nice way?
[Dec 10-06 21:44:40]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well whiny isnt mean
[Dec 10-06 21:44:48]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nah i think guards are 25
[Dec 10-06 21:44:50]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mis
[Dec 10-06 21:44:56]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no but it's annoying and makes people want to tune it out
[Dec 10-06 21:45:2]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ k
[Dec 10-06 21:47:42]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'll look into rush, but I was planning on changing rush anyway
[Dec 10-06 21:47:46]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ahh ok sweet
[Dec 10-06 21:47:48]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thanks :)
[Dec 10-06 21:47:58]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ paladins probably won't have it :P
[Dec 10-06 21:48:4]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what :O
[Dec 10-06 21:48:20]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it makes sense for a centaur one to though :/
[Dec 10-06 21:48:34]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, maybe they will
[Dec 10-06 21:48:42]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ now that I look at their melee max
[Dec 10-06 21:48:58]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but I'm not sure
[Dec 10-06 21:49:0]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ haha i have 6/120 melee
[Dec 10-06 21:49:6]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i thought rush was just charging and attack
[Dec 10-06 21:49:16]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ rush is a melee ability
[Dec 10-06 21:49:22]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ grats to me
[Dec 10-06 21:49:38]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ vian let me charge my rush vs warblade on you?
[Dec 10-06 21:49:48]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im in a party atm
[Dec 10-06 21:49:50]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not charge my rush...try
[Dec 10-06 21:49:52]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol
[Dec 10-06 21:50:6]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if it's with chron, it's not important
[Dec 10-06 21:50:6]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ chronicus and arcanis, dont want to go in arena and have em get mad at me
[Dec 10-06 21:50:14]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ he idles during parties anyway
[Dec 10-06 21:51:44]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ by the way carina, your time would probably be better spent on something besides tame, since I'm writing a bunch of new code to support commanded mobs
[Dec 10-06 22:21:5]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i think paladins should get gate
[Dec 10-06 22:21:13]Carina %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ LOL
[Dec 10-06 22:21:17]Vian %^BOLD%^%^RED%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ <3 hehe

[Dec 15-06 12:16:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ didn't see anything about it
[Dec 15-06 12:17:10]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh, ok my thought was sharpen should take a round even during combat, b/c i can sharpen my sword....while im warblading? it's just not logical you know?
[Dec 15-06 12:17:24]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah.. easily fixed
[Dec 15-06 12:17:32]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ do you agree with me?

[Jan 26-07 22:14:25]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ having players testing things is difficult for a few reasons
[Jan 26-07 22:15:9]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah

[Jan 31-07 20:40:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you could be a faerie antipaladin
[Jan 31-07 20:40:17]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ never seen one of those
[Jan 31-07 20:40:17]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hahahaha

[Jan 31-07 20:41:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sigh, maybe I should just work on my area, we really need some more, badly...

[Jan 31-07 20:42:7]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah we need more places, gets kinda crowded here
[Jan 31-07 20:42:43]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hrmm i might as well stick with blade for now cause of charge though
[Jan 31-07 20:43:5]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you can of course see what weapons you'll be good with
[Jan 31-07 20:43:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sort of regret knife though, should have done projectile
[Jan 31-07 20:44:45]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm, I doubt many antis have trained knife, maybe I'll change it
[Jan 31-07 20:44:57]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ooooo
[Jan 31-07 20:45:19]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i know you did flail a while back already
[Jan 31-07 20:45:37]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ blade never needed changed cause blade is over used
[Jan 31-07 20:45:43]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ maybe ill do knife...
[Jan 31-07 20:45:57]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ even if you dont change it :)
[Jan 31-07 20:46:35]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, blade is for all fighters
[Jan 31-07 20:46:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ then I tried to make each fighter sub good with specific weapon types instead of all fighters being good with all weapons
[Jan 31-07 20:46:57]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah ... i know like how knives are for most rogues
[Jan 31-07 20:47:9]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nod totally works well
[Jan 31-07 20:47:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ projectile is only used by a few though.. knife is used by a lot of subs
[Jan 31-07 20:51:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ one thing you may want to keep in mind though... is that there's nothing keeping you from using a sword in one hand and a whip in the other
[Jan 31-07 20:53:27]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ true...
[Jan 31-07 21:5:27]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ btw Nul, zerkers rock dude... awesome job
[Jan 31-07 21:5:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ err, thanks, but they're not anywhere near done

[Jan 31-07 21:6:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ some of the things I want them to be able to do aren't quite possible yet though
[Jan 31-07 21:6:23]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ emote is excited to see what you have in store for them
[Jan 31-07 21:6:41]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hehe dont worry i aint goin anywhere
[Jan 31-07 21:7:1]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ill be glad to tell ya how good it is when it comes through
[Jan 31-07 21:8:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if you think of anything that's not an attack ability, I'm especially interested to hear it
[Jan 31-07 21:8:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ too many things are made just to hit something and that's it
[Jan 31-07 21:9:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I eventually plan to change balance up so that defenses come into play much more than they do now
[Jan 31-07 21:14:48]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ wow
[Jan 31-07 21:15:2]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ see man you think outside the box
[Jan 31-07 21:15:26]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im still in the box thats in the box under a blanket thats about to get flushed down the toilet
[Jan 31-07 21:16:26]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect shrugs

[Jan 31-07 21:17:14]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they have like, one unique ability
[Jan 31-07 21:17:50]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i was thinking cause they were the balance of the fighter class they would just have more skills then all of them
[Jan 31-07 21:18:30]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ maybe my post wasn't too clear, I plan to make them use combinations of weapons for their abils
[Jan 31-07 21:18:50]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like an abil that requires both a flail and a knife
[Jan 31-07 21:18:58]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ooo dang my bad gotta go read that again
[Jan 31-07 21:19:4]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ wow

[Jan 31-07 21:19:52]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ woot like sword and whip you entangle the whip around their neck while draging them close to stab them
[Jan 31-07 21:20:2]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ dude i just got smarter... kinda
[Jan 31-07 21:21:6]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah that's the archetypal ability for them

[Feb 3-07 0:4:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it might be more noticeable if you fought something that wasn't half your level

[Feb 21-07 1:4:5]Warrick %^BOLD%^B_RED%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well somehow i charged one mob and i kept typing charge monster and it killed the other w/out me actually charging the second
[Feb 21-07 1:4:13]Warrick %^BOLD%^B_RED%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so i killed two mobs for the price of one
[Feb 21-07 1:4:23]Warrick %^BOLD%^B_RED%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and to think i never trained riding :P

[Feb 21-07 1:5:23]Carina %^BOLD%^B_RED%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ idk if it's abuse or not, but with the extra round thing that added after you're out of combat, you can leave the room and start right back up with charge

[Feb 22-07 11:21:30]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well hopefully this abil i have with more stats actually does damage and isnt 100percent skills based :P
[Feb 22-07 11:21:40]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cuz i hate abils that are skills based
[Feb 22-07 11:22:10]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you suck warrick!
[Feb 22-07 11:22:16]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you're so small!

[Feb 22-07 11:22:32]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ even a DRUID killed faster than my charge/slash
[Feb 22-07 11:22:34]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ressurect into a centaur?
[Feb 22-07 11:22:38]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh yeah, that extra charge round
[Feb 22-07 11:22:42]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nulvect moved resurrect to elite
[Feb 22-07 11:22:52]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so now i cant get rez from my lvl 40 cleric :(
[Feb 22-07 11:22:58]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ he got mad too :P
[Feb 22-07 11:23:6]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I don't think anyone has actually gotten resurrect yet
[Feb 22-07 11:23:8]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what about that extra charge round?
[Feb 22-07 11:23:20]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what about it
[Feb 22-07 11:23:28]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh then make it 4 rounds for charge :P
[Feb 22-07 11:23:50]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ only if you're riding
[Feb 22-07 11:23:52]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Warrick felt so weak when a lvl 31 druid with like no stats killed faster than me
[Feb 22-07 11:24:36]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah, so I see
[Feb 22-07 11:24:38]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ why did you move res to such a high lvl? :P
[Feb 22-07 11:24:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you think just any random healer should be able to bring people back from the dead??
[Feb 22-07 11:25:12]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well level 40 sounds fair that aint random
[Feb 22-07 11:25:22]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect shrugs
[Feb 22-07 11:25:48]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i know i aint convincing but already with what clerics gotta deal with its kinda hard ya know for em
[Feb 22-07 11:26:10]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and with being level 40 sounds fair since they gotta deal with cuts and their align problems
[Feb 22-07 11:27:42]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's really not that hard
[Feb 22-07 11:28:24]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well they already are a support class so kinda hard to make that xp and no one really xp's at elite anywho and theres only like a select few that do
[Feb 22-07 11:28:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ not really much I can do about an idling playerbase
[Feb 22-07 11:29:8]Warrick %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah
[Feb 23-07 15:20:49]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just a lil idea that came to mind, i think it would be cool if there were like a berserker only axe or something, maybe like a quest for the berserkers axe or something
[Feb 23-07 16:28:10]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nevermind about the zerker axe, i just heard theres already something like it :P
[Feb 23-07 16:28:16]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ heh
[Feb 23-07 16:28:26]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ areas and items are not things I do very well
[Feb 23-07 16:28:32]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ otherwise I would already be doing them
[Feb 23-07 16:28:54]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i understand
[Feb 23-07 16:29:6]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well you do superb on the ability coding thus far
[Feb 23-07 16:29:18]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hollar to that
[Feb 23-07 16:29:20]%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect shrugs
[Feb 23-07 16:29:24]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ could do better
[Feb 23-07 16:29:36]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ even looking at the things I first made and the ones I do now, there's a huge difference
[Feb 23-07 16:29:36]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ carina, make me an axe mrs item/area :P
[Feb 23-07 16:30:0]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i have
[Feb 23-07 16:30:6]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ gash is pretty cool
[Feb 23-07 16:30:56]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ useful??
[Feb 23-07 16:31:6]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yea i used it as my main abil as warrior
[Feb 23-07 16:31:16]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ before kilik came and smoked me on merk :P
[Feb 23-07 16:31:28]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^Gash is still weaker than slash and/or warblade
[Feb 23-07 16:31:32]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's getting harder to come up with good ability names
[Feb 23-07 16:31:36]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ really?
[Feb 23-07 16:31:40]%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Alexander nods.
[Feb 23-07 16:31:48]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ as demon warrior i was doin better with it, i think
[Feb 23-07 16:31:54]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ unless i was falsely mistaken :P
[Feb 23-07 16:32:2]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ -falsely
[Feb 23-07 16:32:48]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if you have a description of an ability, i'd be happy to brainstorm names :P
[Feb 23-07 16:33:2]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'll look into that, alexander, could you post it on warrior board for me??
[Feb 23-07 16:33:2]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^I have a list of names and ideals in my head, just not worried about posting them.
[Feb 23-07 16:33:12]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^Sure, when I get back to Tirun
[Feb 23-07 16:33:14]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it should be similar to slash but probably not as good as warblade
[Feb 23-07 16:33:14]%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Carina has given ideas
[Feb 23-07 16:34:0]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^Hell, I was thinking of an idea just for 2-legged fighters. footcharge, description is the name itself.
[Feb 23-07 16:34:20]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Feb 23-07 16:34:38]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that just gave me an idea...
[Feb 23-07 16:34:42]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^I also have ideas for other classes as well.
[Feb 23-07 16:34:46]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^Well, I'm glad I could help.
[Feb 23-07 16:34:56]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what if rush... could use any weapon type??
[Feb 23-07 16:35:2]%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect rubs his hands together
[Feb 23-07 16:35:6]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^Then it'd be like a charge.
[Feb 23-07 16:35:10]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that would be cool
[Feb 23-07 16:35:16]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ rushing a creature would be like charging them
[Feb 23-07 16:35:26]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^So it'd be something for the poor 2-legged people
[Feb 23-07 16:35:32]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it would be like a smaller charge
[Feb 23-07 16:35:40]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Feb 23-07 16:35:50]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ would it be used to initiate combat only?
[Feb 23-07 16:35:58]Alexander %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ %^BOLD%^BLACK%^I'd hope so.
[Feb 23-07 16:36:22]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ my idea for rage, was if you rage in melee, there should be no cleave, something replacing it
[Feb 23-07 16:36:56]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ why?? the cleave, though it sounds odd, works just fine with melee
[Feb 23-07 16:37:22]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ shrug my idea of it may be wrong, but i always think of cleave as something with a weapon
[Feb 23-07 16:45:54]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ when i wimpy out of rage, am i supposed to keep raging in the room i wimpy into?
[Feb 23-07 16:46:16]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you are not supposed to be able to wimpy out when raging
[Feb 23-07 16:46:30]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i feared you wouild say that :P
[Feb 23-07 16:46:40]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ defeats the whole purpose :P
[Feb 23-07 16:46:46]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ haha
[Feb 23-07 16:46:48]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol
[Feb 23-07 16:48:59]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ when i would wimpy out of rage
[Feb 23-07 16:49:7]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i would wimpy into a room with alot of mobs
[Feb 23-07 16:49:11]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and keep raging
[Feb 23-07 16:49:15]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it was scary :P
[Feb 23-07 16:49:47]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ no fear, I'll disable wimpying during rage
[Feb 23-07 16:49:53]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ aight :P
[Feb 23-07 16:51:3]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ isnt he so nice? lol
[Feb 23-07 16:51:15]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i've nothing wrong with it
[Feb 23-07 16:51:21]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i'd rather be playin the right way :P
[Feb 23-07 17:1:53]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ok, that should be fixed
[Feb 23-07 17:2:5]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol
[Feb 23-07 17:2:11]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i was raged when you said that
[Feb 23-07 17:2:17]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and i stopped attacking, then i ran out of the room
[Feb 23-07 17:2:27]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and it said "you finally calm down, breathless."
[Feb 23-07 17:2:35]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah, try it again
[Feb 23-07 17:4:53]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ alrighty, so this is what happened.
[Feb 23-07 17:5:1]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i was raged, and couldn't leave this time
[Feb 23-07 17:5:9]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ but, i didn't attack at all
[Feb 23-07 17:5:15]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so i watched myself die :P
[Feb 23-07 17:5:55]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sorry about that... something apparently didn't work the way I thought it did
[Feb 23-07 17:6:3]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sall right
[Feb 23-07 17:6:51]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ let me know before you rage next and I will watch and make sure it works right
[Feb 23-07 17:6:59]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ alrighty
[Feb 23-07 17:7:27]Perel %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ alright, ill test it in a sec, gotta get me stuff :P
[Feb 23-07 17:7:37]%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect sighs

[Feb 24-07 22:17:45]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ rangers are just a bit more subtle than that

[Feb 28-07 23:12:31]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you watching one of us nul? ;)
[Mar 1-07 0:47:37]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nulvect, so far the berserker buffs seem pretty cool. like i feel like my power could be unlimited, if i go all out on stats
[Mar 1-07 0:47:51]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ berserkers power should have no limit, only the person who plays them :P
[Mar 1-07 0:47:53]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Carina wants something new for rangers
[Mar 1-07 0:47:55]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Carina pouts
[Mar 1-07 0:48:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ brawn might be a little too strong, but I think they're going well
[Mar 1-07 0:48:23]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i agree with brawn
[Mar 1-07 0:48:29]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well you saw what i said i believe
[Mar 1-07 0:48:35]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ since you were watchin ;)

[Mar 1-07 0:48:49]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ pft perel

[Mar 1-07 0:49:45]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ woot
[Mar 1-07 0:49:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ specifically another ranged ability and some def stuff
[Mar 1-07 0:50:13]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ barrage did crap to cowl
[Mar 1-07 0:50:21]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like 300 max :P
[Mar 1-07 0:50:23]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ MAXed range too
[Mar 1-07 0:50:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ yeah there's a limit on how much damage you can do from another room
[Mar 1-07 0:50:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ once I fix combat though, that might be lifted
[Mar 1-07 0:51:21]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ gives me some spell ideas :P'
[Mar 1-07 0:51:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ right now if you could kill someone with barrage you wouldn't be held accountable for it by justice or anything
[Mar 1-07 0:51:31]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ casting a spell and it expands in all rooms around you
[Mar 1-07 0:51:45]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well you cant kill someone with it
[Mar 1-07 0:51:49]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it wont let you
[Mar 1-07 0:51:57]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I know, I just explained why
[Mar 1-07 0:51:59]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Mar 1-07 0:52:7]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i need someone bigger to try it on then
[Mar 1-07 0:52:13]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ see how much damage it does
[Mar 1-07 0:52:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmmmmm perel... that could be interesting
[Mar 1-07 0:52:45]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it would be.......magnificant
[Mar 1-07 0:52:49]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ :P
[Mar 1-07 0:52:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ maybe even magnificent
[Mar 1-07 0:53:9]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ haha yea :P
[Mar 1-07 0:53:13]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i should go back to schooL :(
[Mar 1-07 0:53:15]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol
[Mar 1-07 0:54:45]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ see if i drop a mob :P
[Mar 1-07 0:57:27]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you got me all excited for this new abil :P
[Mar 1-07 0:57:31]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ pft
[Mar 1-07 0:57:35]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ never been so happy to poop myself :(
[Mar 1-07 0:57:43]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ lol
[Mar 1-07 1:9:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ might have to make some sensitive changes to make it work though, so it might not be in til tomorrow
[Mar 1-07 1:10:7]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Perel nods
[Mar 2-07 19:6:13]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ removing idle rounds?
[Mar 2-07 19:6:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just something I've been thinking about
[Mar 2-07 19:6:25]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Perel nods
[Mar 2-07 19:9:3]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ imma throw in my 2 cents, you dont have to take them seriously but if idle rounds are removed, it would take somethin pretty nice to keep my spirits up
[Mar 2-07 19:9:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ more likely would be only getting idle rounds when you don't do anything that round
[Mar 2-07 19:9:35]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ah nod
[Mar 2-07 19:9:47]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that would make sense :)
[Mar 2-07 19:9:57]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ why would you dislike losing them completely though??
[Mar 2-07 19:10:17]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ because they can be helpful, and its insentive to get my attack up there to get more idle hits
[Mar 2-07 19:10:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Mar 2-07 19:10:39]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ suprisingly they can do quite a bit :P
[Mar 2-07 19:10:41]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ with alot of sp
[Mar 2-07 19:12:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well, if I change idle hits at all, I would definitely tweak physical ability damage upwards
[Mar 2-07 19:13:39]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods
[Mar 2-07 21:58:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ psst new whirl go try it
[Mar 2-07 21:59:5]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ you said our new abil replaced whirl and sort of coupe, does that mean we dont get whirl?
[Mar 2-07 21:59:29]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Mar 2-07 21:59:39]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ alrighty
[Mar 2-07 21:59:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ your new one is better anyway :P
[Mar 2-07 21:59:57]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ im excited man, and honestly its tempting me to flush my stat goals :P
[Mar 2-07 22:0:23]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ at about 75 for all my mains now i want to go to 50 :(
[Mar 2-07 22:3:21]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i just gotta keep thinkin how much better ill be when i get there :P
[Mar 2-07 22:12:3]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ cant initiate with whirl now...
[Mar 2-07 22:12:19]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ o0o
[Mar 2-07 22:13:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ turned out to be a major pain to allow shooting arrows alongside regular weapons
[Mar 2-07 22:14:3]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what?
[Mar 2-07 22:14:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I just said, "you can use bows/arrows in whirl"
[Mar 2-07 22:14:29]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it's not so useless now
[Mar 2-07 22:14:39]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ speaking of ranged, just curious. will there ever be some sort of throwing weapons? like throwing stars or throwing knives for rogues
[Mar 2-07 22:14:41]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sorry i didnt see that
[Mar 2-07 22:15:9]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i know your not the item/equipment man
[Mar 2-07 22:15:17]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ there won't be weapons that you can't wield normally, but rogues and maybe jesters will get some other throwing abilities
[Mar 2-07 22:15:47]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i think that would be a good addition for assassins
[Mar 2-07 22:15:59]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ since they do what they can to kill without a sound :P

[Mar 5-07 6:30:21]Hercule %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ err i mean real fighting skill not initiate

[Mar 7-07 21:19:21]Ying %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hehe
[Mar 7-07 21:19:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I'll be back later, but I'd like to hear opinions: would it be good to put multiple-round abilities into rage??
[Mar 7-07 21:19:35]Ying %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i aint to far from ya
[Mar 7-07 21:19:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like rush
[Mar 7-07 21:19:49]Ying %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hrmmm
[Mar 7-07 21:19:57]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that would be neat
[Mar 7-07 21:20:17]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ k
[Mar 7-07 21:20:23]Ying %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ as long as we only do it once
[Mar 7-07 21:20:31]Ying %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ because of the cool down time
[Mar 7-07 21:20:49]Perel %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ because if your fighting multiple mobs, rush would likely knock off one of the opponents giving you a head start in the beginning, or saving yoru bum in the end :P
[Mar 7-07 21:20:53]Ying %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and if we rush then rage would it already know that we rushed and it wasnt time to again? or would we lose a round
[Mar 7-07 21:24:9]Ying %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what lvl are ya Perel?
[Mar 7-07 21:24:15]Ying %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i think i stat too much

[Mar 7-07 22:0:15]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ pallies get mysticblade , antipallies should get mystic hammer?
[Mar 7-07 22:0:19]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just a thought
[Mar 7-07 22:0:49]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ or mystic flail
[Mar 7-07 22:1:13]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mystic dirk?

[Mar 9-07 13:35:2]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ did ya get to see my suggestions the other day Nul?
[Mar 9-07 13:35:24]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ I probably did, but remind me
[Mar 9-07 13:36:12]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thinking that since pallies have mysticblade, anti's should have satanic whip or mystic hammer or something to that effect
[Mar 9-07 13:36:30]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ also suggesting mystic hammer for pallies
[Mar 9-07 13:36:46]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh, already have an idea in mind for antis like that
[Mar 9-07 13:36:54]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oh okie

[Mar 9-07 15:2:18]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ rush... hahahaha
[Mar 9-07 15:3:10]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ when you rush in the word savagely, "Vag" sticks out......
[Mar 9-07 15:3:24]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hehe im in the medical field.. you draw your own conclusions

[Mar 9-07 20:56:30]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ at most times i have 55 dex due to godspeed but i still miss my charge to knights in lodos and other 25 ks, is that right?
[Mar 9-07 20:56:34]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hehe
[Mar 9-07 20:56:40]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if it is ill just shut up right now
[Mar 9-07 20:56:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like I said, there are more factors than just that
[Mar 9-07 20:57:4]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ okie
[Mar 9-07 20:57:54]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ still need to get slash though
[Mar 10-07 15:4:50]Toshio %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ arent warriors supposed to be able to single wield double handed weapons?
[Mar 10-07 15:5:8]Toshio %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ maybe its a skill thing
[Mar 10-07 15:6:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ it doesn't come for free
[Mar 10-07 15:8:10]%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Toshio sits on a corner dirtyies up and begs... "skills for the poor"

[Mar 14-07 21:49:10]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ Nul how bout this one, like how aurasink or even flamewall works, pallies might have a blessed hammer that circles around them protecting them like an guardian angel
[Mar 14-07 21:49:28]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ or does that sound too cleric like
[Mar 14-07 21:49:42]Tai %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hehe tell me if im sayin too much Nul

[Mar 22-07 20:40:14]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ this is just me of course

[Mar 22-07 20:40:38]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i actually need to raise char/int/wis up 3 points each
[Mar 22-07 20:40:44]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ they're not at a 0 ot 5

[Mar 22-07 20:41:18]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ dex and con are your friend
[Mar 22-07 20:42:22]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ (if ur campin for diamond or some shiz) can ya grab another snakeband while your at it? i think those have better ac then tha saph rings
[Mar 22-07 20:43:32]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well both snakeband rings and sapphire rings do things
[Mar 22-07 20:43:42]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so it's good to have at least one of each
[Mar 22-07 20:43:56]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ ahhh
[Mar 22-07 20:44:0]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ well then!

[Mar 22-07 20:45:12]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sapphire rings pruify your blood if you're posioned
[Mar 22-07 20:45:22]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and snakeband rings give you sp
[Mar 22-07 20:45:30]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oooooo, can you grab 1 each if ur rollin thru merk city then?

[Mar 23-07 13:28:52]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ o0o0o idea
[Mar 23-07 13:29:26]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ in real life horses have to have their shoes sharpened....is that something they could do here?
[Mar 23-07 13:29:46]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what purpose would that serve??
[Mar 23-07 13:29:48]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ like you can hit harder b/c you can move faster if they're sharpened
[Mar 23-07 13:30:8]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and you get less damage on the opponent if they're not
[Mar 23-07 13:30:28]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ sounds like giving more benefits to a race that is already pretty good
[Mar 23-07 13:30:48]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i dont mean hit harder than you do now
[Mar 23-07 13:31:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ so more like a penalty if they aren't
[Mar 23-07 13:31:32]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Mar 23-07 13:33:1]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ doesn't really sound worth the trouble
[Mar 23-07 13:33:23]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ all good, not all my ideas are worthwhile lol
[Mar 26-07 0:15:30]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ oo carina, quick question: what makes mudthrow/mudarmor better besides skills
[Mar 26-07 0:16:12]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mudarmour nothing
[Mar 26-07 0:16:20]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ darn :(
[Mar 26-07 0:16:26]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ mudthrow i would assume dex/str, but i dont know since i dont use it
[Mar 26-07 0:16:34]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kk
[Mar 26-07 0:21:26]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ i'll tell ya what

[Mar 26-07 0:21:56]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ thats what im trying :P
[Mar 26-07 0:22:4]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ we'll see how it goes, then raise your lvl to find out what affects it most
[Mar 26-07 0:22:6]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ that work?

[Mar 26-07 0:22:38]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ then make a double
[Mar 26-07 0:22:46]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and raise the lvl to my lvl
[Mar 26-07 0:22:52]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ and raise the stats to find out
[Mar 26-07 0:23:0]Carina %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just to be sure which it is
[Mar 26-07 0:23:6]Jutalathau %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kk

[Mar 27-07 21:50:3]Carina %^BOLD%^B_RED%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ if not, we can later
[Mar 27-07 21:50:13]Carina %^BOLD%^B_RED%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ just a thought if you werent busy
[Mar 27-07 21:52:5]Nulvect %^BOLD%^B_RED%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ in a few
[Mar 27-07 21:53:23]Carina %^BOLD%^B_RED%^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ kk just holler when you're up for it
[Mar 28-07 15:46:1]Yang %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ me dont even know what me saving xp for
[Mar 30-07 20:56:37]Kahre %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ what level is slash?
[Apr 4-07 22:46:8]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ hehe why do i make a better warrior then an antipaladin
[Apr 5-07 0:35:6]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ when do i get warblade?
[Apr 5-07 0:38:14]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ next month
[Apr 5-07 0:38:22]Yang %^MAGENTA%^<fighter>%^RESET%^ woot
[Apr 10-07 3:8:13]Yang <fighter> hehe didnt know weimics could charge like centaurs
[Apr 10-07 3:8:25]<fighter> Nulvect nods
[Apr 10-07 3:8:45]Yang <fighter> and they have better dex then centaurs
[Apr 16-07 15:40:50]Yang <fighter> did we already talk about the whole charging thingy?
[Apr 18-07 23:13:9]Edge <fighter> so am i still losing pound? or is it just getting revamped?
[Apr 18-07 23:14:39]Nulvect <fighter> I'll probably be taking pound out
[Apr 18-07 23:15:1]Nulvect <fighter> it kind of feels like there are too many redundant abilities flying around
[Apr 18-07 23:15:15]Edge <fighter> i guess thats true
[Apr 18-07 23:21:13]Edge <fighter> just throwing this out in the wind..but any chance of making 'fear' a multihitting para? as of now its the one attack in rage i hate :P
[Apr 18-07 23:21:29]Edge <fighter> i saw someone posted it
[Apr 18-07 23:21:33]Edge <fighter> seemed like a good idea
[Apr 18-07 23:23:51]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm, perhaps
[Apr 18-07 23:24:41]Edge <fighter> nice nice
[Apr 19-07 22:47:30]Carina <fighter> do other classes have massive sp problems? or is it just me?
[Apr 19-07 22:47:50]Rendan <fighter> wellll
[Apr 19-07 22:48:6]Rendan <fighter> other than being completely out of sp after every rage,not rlly
[Apr 19-07 22:48:14]Rendan <fighter> charge seems to take quite a bit though
[Apr 19-07 22:48:18]Carina <fighter> i meant us, not me
[Apr 19-07 22:50:38]Carina <fighter> it wouldnt be so bad if there was something better for clerics, b/c boosters are needed
[Apr 19-07 22:51:8]Nulvect <fighter> I'll look into fixing up their healing spells to keep them more good and maybe give a bit of exp
[Apr 19-07 22:51:10]Nulvect <fighter> but not right now
[Apr 19-07 22:51:18]Carina <fighter> nods-
[Apr 19-07 22:51:26]Carina <fighter> what you doing now?
[Apr 19-07 22:52:0]Carina <fighter> anything for rangers?
[Apr 20-07 2:33:15]Nulvect <fighter> hey, slash still works decently for you guys, right??
[Apr 20-07 2:33:25]Yang <fighter> yups
[Apr 20-07 2:33:29]Nulvect <fighter> good good
[Apr 20-07 2:33:31]Yang <fighter> i use gash more though now
[Apr 20-07 2:33:33]Yang <fighter> just because
[Apr 20-07 2:35:35]Yang <fighter> was slash changed?
[Apr 20-07 2:36:39]Yang <fighter> gash is supposed to be stronger then slash right?
[Apr 20-07 2:38:53]Yang <fighter> hrmm about the same
[Apr 20-07 2:48:55]Nulvect <fighter> slash should be about the same.. I merged cut into it
[Apr 20-07 2:50:21]Yang <fighter> let me be the first to say, well since ive heard, that these moves are awesome Nul
[Apr 20-07 2:50:29]Yang <fighter> like really out side of the box stuff man
[Apr 20-07 2:51:43]Nulvect <fighter> uh... what, gash??
[Apr 20-07 2:52:3]Yang <fighter> and all the other ideas with combining moves
[Apr 20-07 2:52:13]Nulvect <fighter> oh
[Apr 20-07 2:52:27]Nulvect <fighter> I'm just trying to cut back on the number of abilities that do the same thing
[Apr 20-07 2:52:41]Yang <fighter> awesome
[Apr 20-07 2:53:33]Nulvect <fighter> I actually forget about gash most of the time :P
[Apr 20-07 2:54:5]Yang <fighter> hehe like the combo considering you can wield 2 diff weapons
[Apr 20-07 2:55:31]Yang <fighter> hehe i dont think you have to mess wif warriors anymore man
[Apr 20-07 2:55:41]Nulvect <fighter> they're pretty boring
[Apr 20-07 2:55:49]Yang <fighter> not with the combo stuff
[Apr 20-07 2:56:5]Yang <fighter> with all their skills and stuff raknids warrior would rock
[Apr 20-07 2:56:23]Yang <fighter> considering they have higher skills per lvl they do rock
[Apr 20-07 2:56:43]Yang <fighter> but you the boss man
[Apr 20-07 2:57:17]Nulvect <fighter> shrug, I just want them to be interesting
[Apr 20-07 2:57:37]Yang <fighter> i know that anything you do wif them will rock
[Apr 20-07 3:13:43]Yang <fighter> hehe cant sharpen whip
[Apr 20-07 3:13:59]Rendan <fighter> heh
[Apr 22-07 23:35:20]Endosia <fighter> well no fun, other than coupe...i have all im gonna get at lvl 19
[Apr 22-07 23:35:24]Endosia <fighter> and whirl
[Apr 22-07 23:35:50]Daboura <fighter> sucks to be you?
[Apr 23-07 22:52:59]Ancient <fighter> pound is gone im guessing? :P - ahh well
[Apr 23-07 22:53:41]Nulvect <fighter> yeah, it was stupid anyway
[Apr 23-07 22:54:41]Nulvect <fighter> bash should be more useful for the people meant to use it, than it used to be
[Apr 23-07 22:55:5]Ancient <fighter> Nice, i will check it out then.
[Apr 24-07 20:48:45]Yang <fighter> Nul no more pound?
[Apr 24-07 20:49:19]Nulvect <fighter> no, it was lame
[Apr 24-07 20:49:57]Nulvect <fighter> bash should be better for you now than maul was
[Apr 24-07 20:50:9]Ancient <fighter> iv been using bash its nice
[Apr 24-07 20:50:17]Nulvect <fighter> basically I made the generic weapon abilities into one per weapon, and they are better for the people meant to use tem
[Apr 24-07 20:50:19]Ancient <fighter> about 1 in 10 chance of para i say
[Apr 24-07 20:50:57]Yang <fighter> koo koo
[Apr 24-07 20:50:59]Yang <fighter> there ya go
[Apr 24-07 21:0:57]Ancient <fighter> i take that back..more like 1/30 chance of para, still nice.
[Apr 25-07 0:36:15]Yang <fighter> hrmm almost tempted to try anti for a bit
[Apr 25-07 0:36:25]Warcanis <fighter> haha
[Apr 25-07 0:36:43]Warcanis <fighter> if u dont got a decent charge weimic centaur or raknid g'luck it sux otherwise
[Apr 25-07 0:37:21]Nulvect <fighter> yeah, and the whole being able to boost yourself part is just there to lull you into a false sense of security
[Apr 25-07 0:37:33]Warcanis <fighter> i dont boost myself
[Apr 25-07 0:37:39]Warcanis <fighter> my opinion, remove it
[Apr 25-07 0:37:47]Nulvect <fighter> I would love to remove your opinion
[Apr 25-07 0:37:55]Carina <fighter> ha
[Apr 25-07 0:37:55]Warcanis <fighter> note i had a comma :P
[Apr 25-07 0:38:15]Ancient <fighter> lol
[Apr 25-07 0:38:23]Warcanis <fighter> only time boost was good with antis was when we had old gore
[Apr 25-07 0:38:51]<fighter> Warcanis remembers the good ole days.
[Apr 25-07 0:38:53]Nulvect <fighter> sure thing
[Apr 25-07 0:39:1]Warcanis <fighter> cuz old gore raped!
[Apr 25-07 0:39:19]Warcanis <fighter> not that new gore aint bad but just its not the thing to insta ppl wif anymore
[Apr 25-07 0:39:49]Nulvect <fighter> instakilling players should be difficult
[Apr 25-07 0:39:57]Warcanis <fighter> not players, mobs i meant
[Apr 25-07 0:40:5]Warcanis <fighter> players should not be insta'd so easily
[Apr 25-07 0:40:27]Warcanis <fighter> unless their is a stat/lvl difference
[Apr 25-07 0:40:45]Nulvect <fighter> instakilling a mob that gives uncut exp shouldn't be easy, either
[Apr 25-07 0:41:47]Warcanis <fighter> well it shouldnt be easy but it shouldnt be at a point where you need to take xp cuts in order to do it
[Apr 25-07 0:43:5]Warcanis <fighter> now im wondering why the fighter population has increased  :/
[Apr 25-07 0:59:3]Carina <fighter> i dont insta any mobs that give me full XP
[Apr 25-07 0:59:9]Carina <fighter> that's just a side note
[Apr 25-07 0:59:17]Warcanis <fighter> but you did lvl past L51 :P
[Apr 25-07 0:59:29]Carina <fighter> well over a year ago
[Apr 25-07 11:42:29]Carina <fighter> and although ancient maybe a couple months older than me, he wasn't always a fighter, so I was technically the first fighter that's on right now, so I should be telling you what to do lol
[Apr 25-07 11:42:37]Carina <fighter> ;)
[Apr 25-07 11:42:41]<fighter> Warcanis jumps Carina.
[Apr 25-07 11:42:53]Warcanis <fighter> always getting so technical :P
[Apr 25-07 11:42:59]Carina <fighter> ;) you know me
[Apr 25-07 11:43:9]<fighter> Warcanis shoots himself
[Apr 25-07 11:43:13]Carina <fighter> technicalities are awesome
[Apr 25-07 11:43:25]Carina <fighter> so what are you getting me for my birthday?!?!?!
[Apr 25-07 11:43:25]<fighter> Warcanis thinks shooting yourself is awesome do it ...do it!

[May 9-07 2:55:38]Yang <fighter> hehe i think ill lvl after Nul is done wif warriors
[May 10-07 0:31:16]Yang <fighter> hey Nul did i ask you about restart?
[May 10-07 0:31:46]Yang <fighter> about restarting a char like remort, bringing them back down to 1
[May 10-07 0:35:34]A shadow <fighter> yes, I have that on my list of stuff to do, along with a more detailed listing with remort list
[May 10-07 0:35:46]Yang <fighter> okie
[May 10-07 0:35:46]A shadow <fighter> and I didn't make an alias for this line apparently
[May 10-07 0:36:4]Yang <fighter> since i gotcha for a sec can i ask you what you thought about my blackjack idea?
[May 10-07 0:36:28]Yang <fighter> i know its pretty generic
[May 10-07 0:37:4]Yang <fighter> k its on rogue board
[May 10-07 0:38:44]Yang <fighter> kinda but hard enough it would bring them to the ground
[May 12-07 1:40:15]Scoff <fighter> hey nul
[May 12-07 1:40:37]Scoff <fighter> that Valor skill, is that still a non working kinda skill?
[May 12-07 1:41:47]Scoff <fighter> ah ok.
[May 12-07 1:42:21]Scoff <fighter> right o, i was just checken it out. Thinking about training it up is all :P
[May 15-07 21:58:31]Yang <fighter> note to self shoot drow, drow get mad, drow come after you, run...
[May 15-07 22:5:33]Carina <fighter> that's a good note
[May 15-07 22:7:13]Yang <fighter> hiya Rina
[May 15-07 22:7:33]Yang <fighter> didnt know a slingshot was a projectile, been impaling things left and right with it
[May 15-07 22:7:55]Yang <fighter> and charging, thats the fun one
[May 18-07 16:4:43]Yang <fighter> did you see my post on the fighter board yet Nul? just a few ideas
[May 18-07 16:25:25]Yang <fighter>  lol kool kool Nul
[May 21-07 21:20:24]Yang <fighter> i wanted to know if i should be able to impale and charge wif a slingshot... cause i can
[May 21-07 21:20:52]Yang <fighter> i always thought that it was more of a ranged weapon
[May 21-07 21:20:58]Yang <fighter> ok
[May 21-07 21:21:38]Yang <fighter> oooo
[May 21-07 21:21:50]Yang <fighter> was messin around wif weapons the other day
[May 21-07 21:22:0]Yang <fighter> and tried to shoot wif it
[May 21-07 21:22:6]Yang <fighter> hehe
[May 21-07 21:22:44]<fighter> Yang nod
[May 21-07 21:23:2]Yang <fighter> like spears and such
[May 21-07 21:23:20]Yang <fighter> so i thought slingshot would be more ranged like a bow or so
[May 21-07 21:24:10]<fighter> Yang nods
[May 29-07 7:47:55]Darwyn <fighter> Le sigh idle idle idle =(
[May 29-07 13:37:50]Darwyn <fighter> . . . How did that happen. I was riding my mount around, then all of a sudden i was idle attacking my mount and now the poor thing is ded.
[May 29-07 22:9:15]<fighter> Darwyn "One is the lonliest number"
[May 29-07 22:9:29]<fighter> Darwyn sings "One is the lonliest number"  **
[May 29-07 22:11:10]Carina <fighter> i believe he means you darwin
[May 29-07 22:12:50]Darwyn <fighter> Yeah i was off to get a notebook to map stuff
[May 29-07 22:13:4]Darwyn <fighter> yeah it was a made spear, was gonna bug it but then i forgot >.<
[May 29-07 22:13:24]Darwyn <fighter> sorry
[May 29-07 22:14:30]Darwyn <fighter> Have you tested repairs on all crafted weapons? I am new here but I was both a class leader for another mud, and a creator for a 3rd. So I am willing to help test, I dont wanna code though, takes away from the gameplay =)
[May 29-07 22:15:38]Darwyn <fighter> Hey carina, now that i have you unidle, do you know of anywhere i can find some good AL spears?
[May 29-07 22:15:52]Darwyn <fighter> I really like that comand "spear"   over charge
[May 29-07 22:16:8]Carina <fighter> what lvl?
[May 29-07 22:16:18]Darwyn <fighter> I am 30
[May 29-07 22:16:30]Carina <fighter> no idea hun, i'm sorry
[May 29-07 22:16:46]Darwyn <fighter> thats cool, I have a ton of exploration to go =)
[May 29-07 22:17:16]Darwyn <fighter> Nul are you available for 2 quick questions?
[May 29-07 23:32:48]Darwyn <fighter> Dunno if anyone is around, but i figure I can at least muse outloud.
[May 29-07 23:33:24]Darwyn <fighter> Curious, not complaining just curious, why it was decided, or an oversight, to not be able to sharpen spears
[May 29-07 23:34:32]Darwyn <fighter> sharp weapon, even easier for wooden ones, balance maybe? Just struck me as odd, not that its a huge deal, maybe i will *idea* it
[May 29-07 23:34:40]Darwyn <fighter> do you guys have the idea command active?
[May 29-07 23:34:54]Darwyn <fighter> Ok, =)
[May 29-07 23:35:34]Darwyn <fighter> Oh, and how big of a bribe to make my tea pot AL ?
[May 29-07 23:38:0]Darwyn <fighter> ah, the only reason i bring it up is I am terribly bad at remembering to grab the menial stuff when going out.
[May 29-07 23:38:20]Darwyn <fighter> Which is why I like the forage/skin/gut commands =) Materials on the go.
[May 29-07 23:39:4]Darwyn <fighter> Heh, more along the lines of hoping to be able to keep the pot in my pack all the time. =)
[May 29-07 23:39:22]Darwyn <fighter> but making one would also be satisfactory.
[May 29-07 23:39:32]Darwyn <fighter> one last quickie
[May 29-07 23:39:46]Darwyn <fighter> so people are still actively workingon the game?
[May 30-07 0:24:14]Darwyn <fighter> So throwing up worthwhile ideas on the board here and there is viable then.
[May 30-07 0:25:52]Carina <fighter> nul actually listens and if he likes ideas, he does them
[May 30-07 0:27:32]Darwyn <fighter> I am very "balance orientated" so i hardly ever throw out foolish posts, and Nul will appreciate the fact that i almost never bash commands/coding.
[May 30-07 0:27:54]Darwyn <fighter> though some doors here could stand to be fixed >.< unless they are just to ares that arent finished yet
[May 30-07 0:28:44]Carina <fighter> we got word?
[May 30-07 0:28:48]Carina <fighter> work?
[May 30-07 0:28:54]Darwyn <fighter> it would be more general ideas, or even for other classes
[May 30-07 0:29:24]Darwyn <fighter> even when i was primarily a fighter on my old mud, i would still put up ideas on other boards alot.
[May 30-07 0:29:44]Darwyn <fighter> and i do love spear =)
[May 30-07 0:30:12]Carina <fighter> by work i thought you meant something new, yeah thing were redone which is awesome i might add b/c they needed it
[May 30-07 0:30:24]Carina <fighter> but i thought i got something new that i didnt know about
[May 30-07 0:30:30]Carina <fighter> i got all excited for a second
[May 30-07 0:30:34]<fighter> Darwyn snickers
[May 30-07 0:31:2]Darwyn <fighter> carina, is coup a "fighter" elite or ranger?
[May 30-07 0:31:12]Carina <fighter> fighter
[May 30-07 0:31:36]Darwyn <fighter> ah, good so still some mystery to what i am working on
[May 30-07 0:31:38]Carina <fighter> i only ever have used it if i was PKin
[May 30-07 0:32:0]Carina <fighter> not worth the sp during XP
[May 30-07 0:32:8]Carina <fighter> woot
[May 30-07 0:32:14]Darwyn <fighter> I just have to get it through my head that i am not the old darwyn, and i cant take as many chances.

[Jun 20-07 20:44:52]Bam <fighter> just a suggestion
[Jun 20-07 22:52:34]Yang <fighter> ?
[Jun 20-07 22:54:32]Carina <fighter> when i say we dont get work, i mean that i see everyone getting almost completely revamped and new things..like i've said before, i love the changes on the things that are in...but i wanted something new. that's all i mean by it, a new abil or something
[Jun 20-07 22:54:50]Carina <fighter> not that they have not gotten work, b/c i know things have been changed
[Jun 20-07 22:55:26]Carina <fighter> it's just using the same things in combat, over and over charge and warblade is all that does well in combat for me
[Jun 20-07 22:59:0]<fighter> Yang wants warblade
[Jun 20-07 22:59:12]<fighter> Yang cant lvl though
[Jun 25-07 20:29:14]Bam <fighter> hey Nul I got another idea for ya, not much this time though

[Aug 21-07 14:34:12]Darken <fighter> yikes getting good starting stats is not so fun
[Aug 21-07 14:34:24]Ralok <fighter> do what I did
[Aug 21-07 14:34:32]Ralok <fighter> aim for 17 str, 20 dex
[Aug 21-07 14:34:40]Ralok <fighter> then push it!
[Aug 21-07 14:34:48]Darken <fighter> 17 str 19 dex
[Aug 21-07 14:34:54]Ralok <fighter> not bad. :)
[Aug 21-07 14:35:0]Darken <fighter> 13 con, 3 char, 3 intel 10 wis
[Aug 21-07 14:35:6]Ralok <fighter> but u can get greedy for that last point. I would
[Aug 21-07 14:35:12]Darken <fighter> ain't pretty or smart ;)
[Aug 21-07 14:35:14]Ralok <fighter> yer other stats are shaditty.
[Aug 21-07 14:35:36]Darken <fighter> eh i'll roll with it
[Aug 21-07 20:6:59]Yang <fighter> hrmm lets see how fast i die

[Aug 22-07 11:8:56]Zack <fighter> lol
[Aug 22-07 11:9:6]Kokujin <fighter> why?
[Aug 22-07 11:9:16]Zack <fighter> our dex con costs the same, str is more expensive
[Aug 22-07 11:9:24]<fighter> Ralok wants str first.
[Aug 22-07 11:9:24]Zack <fighter> but str helps -tons- more with charge
[Aug 22-07 11:9:38]Zack <fighter> 106 in each main and i insta rhon
[Aug 22-07 11:9:40]Kokujin <fighter> no dex, we miss tho
[Aug 22-07 11:9:48]Zack <fighter> it dont take much to hit
[Aug 22-07 11:9:54]Zack <fighter> u can hit up to 50k with 50 dex
[Aug 22-07 11:9:58]Zack <fighter> at least
[Aug 22-07 11:10:8]Zack <fighter> i was doing 25ks with 20 dex so i mean :P
[Aug 22-07 11:10:32]Zack <fighter> get some dex, i aint saying dont get any, just go balls out on str :P
[Aug 22-07 11:10:54]Zack <fighter> we can party in a bit guys
[Aug 22-07 11:17:42]Ralok <fighter> What weapons u use, Zack?
[Aug 22-07 11:18:18]Zack <fighter> i have starscreams, dslayers, black daggers, ancient hatchets, obsidian maces
[Aug 22-07 11:18:34]Ralok <fighter> quite the arsenal. >:)
[Aug 22-07 11:18:48]Kokujin <fighter> he's got 1 set of weapons for every outfit
[Aug 22-07 11:20:38]Ralok <fighter> can u wield 2 handed weapons with 1 hand?
[Aug 22-07 11:20:42]Kokujin <fighter> no
[Aug 22-07 11:21:0]Ralok <fighter> Zack?
[Aug 22-07 11:21:36]Zack <fighter> no
[Aug 22-07 11:21:48]Zack <fighter> gash is good
[Aug 22-07 11:21:50]Ralok <fighter> is that a myth? or really high up?
[Aug 22-07 11:22:6]Zack <fighter> gash is knife and sword
[Aug 22-07 11:22:18]Zack <fighter> its good til slash hits twice
[Aug 22-07 11:23:24]Kokujin <fighter> raknids can wield two 2h weapons tho
[Aug 22-07 11:23:34]<fighter> Ralok nods.
[Aug 22-07 11:24:0]Zack <fighter> im having a bachelor breakfast
[Aug 22-07 11:24:10]Kokujin <fighter> snickers and beer??
[Aug 22-07 11:24:18]Zack <fighter> waffle, no plate, put syrup on it out of the bottle and a beer

[Aug 22-07 11:51:38]Zack <fighter> im gonna make another "waffle sandwich" brb :P
[Aug 22-07 11:51:52]Ralok <fighter> hehe
[Aug 22-07 11:52:4]Ralok <fighter> I wish a katana was a better weapon.
[Aug 22-07 11:52:46]Ralok <fighter> it'd have to be real scary to see a big bad raknid wielding four katanas screaming "waaaaaaaaa!'
[Aug 22-07 11:53:12]<fighter> Ralok would totally scream 'Waaaaa!'
[Aug 22-07 11:53:24]Kokujin <fighter> yhea, god forbid a weapon used by a culture with 1000's of years of killing experience be any good
[Aug 22-07 11:53:34]Zack <fighter> in my opinion, do you want to know what the best ability is :P
[Aug 22-07 11:53:44]Ralok <fighter> aim!
[Aug 22-07 11:53:48]Zack <fighter> riposte
[Aug 22-07 11:53:52]Kokujin <fighter> pain

[Aug 22-07 11:54:34]Ralok <fighter> you talk about pwncakes yet eat waffles. Yer a mystery, Zack.
[Aug 22-07 11:54:46]Zack <fighter> lol
[Aug 22-07 11:56:16]<fighter> Ralok wants to wield a sword made by a demented (is there any other kind?) Postal worker. That oughtta kick butt.
[Aug 22-07 11:56:28]Kokujin <fighter> yes there is
[Aug 22-07 11:56:34]Kokujin <fighter> 2 types of postal workers
[Aug 22-07 11:56:52]Kokujin <fighter> demented...and lazy...lazy postal workers is what makes regular postal workers demented
[Aug 22-07 11:57:6]Ralok <fighter> ahhhh
[Aug 22-07 12:0:33]Zack <fighter> too bad im gettin bored
[Aug 22-07 12:0:39]Zack <fighter> if i kept this rate id be elite by noon lol
[Aug 22-07 12:0:47]Ralok <fighter> hehe
[Aug 22-07 12:0:55]Ralok <fighter> getting eq is prolly less boring. >:)
[Aug 24-07 0:18:9]Darken <fighter> hey nul? are there higher level weapon abils or just the one?
[Aug 24-07 0:18:47]<fighter> Darken nods.
[Aug 24-07 0:19:13]Darken <fighter> so mainly skill based damage on those?
[Aug 24-07 0:21:27]Darken <fighter> it was worth a shot ;)
[Aug 24-07 0:27:15]Darken <fighter> could you make gash usable with an axe?
[Aug 24-07 0:57:49]Darken <fighter> nul, if you get a chance, can you take a look at entangle? it's a pretty low level abil, but i can't get it to land on anything
[Aug 24-07 0:59:19]Darken <fighter> k, but that's not for a while yet right? any chance of a patch?
[Aug 24-07 0:59:37]Darken <fighter> maybe not that specifically, but something?
[Aug 24-07 0:59:45]<fighter> Darken nods.
[Aug 24-07 0:59:55]Darken <fighter> come on you can't be that busy... :P
[Aug 24-07 1:0:45]Darken <fighter> it was a joke, i know you work your ass off around here
[Aug 24-07 1:0:55]<fighter> Nulvect shrugs
[Aug 24-07 1:1:17]Darken <fighter> i do like whip though, the chance for knock down is fun
[Aug 24-07 1:2:31]Darken <fighter> yea, i want to get some decent stats so i can do some testing, were they all meant to be around the same damage wise?
[Aug 24-07 1:3:39]Darken <fighter> k
[Aug 24-07 1:3:51]Darken <fighter> i'm guessing you will be turning charge down?
[Aug 24-07 1:4:29]Darken <fighter> yea it's pretty beefy, but then again so is bs, last i checked anyway
[Aug 24-07 1:4:51]Darken <fighter> you could crank up crushingblow, skunk wouldn't mind ;)
[Aug 24-07 1:5:51]Darken <fighter> you could do monks, that would be ok ;)
[Aug 24-07 1:7:55]Darken <fighter> did you do zerker already or not yet?
[Aug 24-07 1:8:13]Darken <fighter> but you already did the sub
[Aug 24-07 1:8:27]Darken <fighter> that was a question by the way ;)
[Aug 24-07 1:9:1]Darken <fighter> so all you have left in the 2's are thug and assassin?
[Aug 24-07 1:9:35]Darken <fighter> still going with the same list on the 1's?
[Aug 24-07 1:10:11]Darken <fighter> that's the same as the list you posted :P
[Aug 24-07 1:10:39]Darken <fighter> thief, scout, jester, swash, monk, anti
[Aug 24-07 1:10:53]Darken <fighter> ahhh, what happened?
[Aug 24-07 1:11:15]Darken <fighter> hardware or software?
[Aug 24-07 1:12:15]Darken <fighter> i had that happen before
[Aug 24-07 1:12:23]Darken <fighter> turned out it was a nasty bit of spyware
[Aug 24-07 1:12:39]Darken <fighter> odd
[Aug 24-07 1:13:5]Darken <fighter> so it did it then you did the reinstall?
[Aug 24-07 1:13:13]Darken <fighter> or it started right after you did the reinstall
[Aug 24-07 1:13:29]Darken <fighter> changed port on the switch?
[Aug 24-07 1:13:43]Darken <fighter> reset the switch?
[Aug 24-07 1:14:7]Darken <fighter> hmmm
[Aug 24-07 1:14:43]Darken <fighter> change the pci slot for the nic?
[Aug 24-07 1:15:25]Darken <fighter> well that about rules everything out except for the mainboard
[Aug 24-07 1:16:11]Darken <fighter> but it working after you got the new nic is kinda suspect
[Aug 24-07 1:16:45]Darken <fighter> hehe, kinda frustrating
[Aug 24-07 1:17:9]Darken <fighter> just for grins and giggles you could throw windows on see if it works ;)
[Aug 24-07 1:17:41]Darken <fighter> try changing the name on the box?
[Aug 24-07 1:17:53]Darken <fighter> also, static or dynamic ip?
[Aug 24-07 1:18:59]Darken <fighter> 10lb sledge hammer?
[Aug 24-07 1:19:3]Darken <fighter> :D
[Aug 24-07 1:19:25]Darken <fighter> the mainboard still under warranty?
[Aug 24-07 1:19:57]Darken <fighter> i'm thinking about getting a new dell laptop, i would get the accidental damage coverage :D
[Aug 24-07 1:20:5]Darken <fighter> you can spill beer on it and they replace it
[Aug 24-07 1:20:11]Darken <fighter> kinda crazy
[Aug 24-07 1:20:39]Darken <fighter> yea, but accidents do happen ;)
[Aug 24-07 1:21:11]Darken <fighter> haha, i'm missing the escape key
[Aug 24-07 1:21:27]Darken <fighter> scrape off the little windows icon?
[Aug 24-07 1:22:1]Darken <fighter> haha, i think we have a couple old wyse keyboards laying around at work
[Aug 24-07 1:23:17]Darken <fighter> i could work with that
[Aug 24-07 1:23:25]Darken <fighter> i like the ergo keyboards though
[Aug 24-07 1:24:15]Darken <fighter> i used one for a while on a friends pc and got used to it
[Aug 24-07 1:25:11]Darken <fighter> i can't believe they want so much for these...

[Aug 24-07 1:27:15]Darken <fighter> there ya go nul
[Aug 24-07 1:27:21]Darken <fighter> little spendy, but cool
[Aug 24-07 1:28:1]Daos <fighter> best buy is a good place to shop, I get most of my stuff from circuit city
[Aug 24-07 1:28:47]Darken <fighter> don't like the linux keyboard? :P
[Aug 24-07 1:29:1]Daos <fighter> yeah, I was going to spend $75 for a kensington but settled for the in house brand instead at $19.99
[Aug 24-07 1:29:25]Darken <fighter> the only way i would actually spend money on a keyboard is if i got into gaming again
[Aug 24-07 1:30:11]Daos <fighter> yeah, I don't really do a lot of gaming, maybe WoW occasionally
[Aug 24-07 1:30:49]Daos <fighter> nice, I will be upgrading to 2 gigs
[Aug 24-07 1:31:5]Darken <fighter> 2 gig on this work laptop
[Aug 24-07 1:31:23]Darken <fighter> trying to get my boss to bump me up to 4 gig on my work desktop
[Aug 24-07 1:31:53]Daos <fighter> but now that I have more money I need to pay off my student loans and bills so I can get my credit rating up and go back to school for my 4 year degree
[Aug 24-07 1:32:17]Darken <fighter> this laptop is nice, but heavy as hell, dell m90
[Aug 24-07 1:32:33]Darken <fighter> it's the only one they had laying around for me to use for when i'm on call
[Aug 24-07 1:32:55]Darken <fighter> when the other girl leaves in a week i'll be getting a small one with a 12 inch screen
[Aug 24-07 1:33:11]<fighter> Daos nods
[Aug 24-07 1:34:5]Darken <fighter> what i really would like is a dell xps 1330 though
[Aug 24-07 1:34:11]Darken <fighter> maybe for my tax return
[Aug 24-07 1:34:21]Daos <fighter> I probably won't upgrade my desktop for 1-2 years
[Aug 24-07 1:34:49]Darken <fighter> my personal pc is a 6 year old sony laptop
[Aug 24-07 1:34:49]Daos <fighter> except the ram upgrade and I will put vista on in 6 months or so
[Aug 24-07 1:35:1]Darken <fighter> vista...
[Aug 24-07 1:35:18]<fighter> Darken dies.
[Aug 24-07 1:35:28]Darken <fighter> eh, if you put vista on you will NEED the ram
[Aug 24-07 1:36:54]Daos <fighter> I was using ubuntu but linux is still lacking in some areas guys
[Aug 24-07 21:54:7]Yang <fighter> haha i should have been a fighter
[Aug 24-07 21:54:15]Yang <fighter> i mean an centaur fighter
[Aug 24-07 21:54:29]Yang <fighter> they can charge and rush, me charge run away then come back to rush
[Aug 26-07 21:49:4]Yang <fighter> hey nul
[Aug 26-07 21:49:14]Yang <fighter> whats on your mind for Warriors?
[Aug 26-07 21:50:16]Yang <fighter> k

[Aug 26-07 21:51:0]Yang <fighter> was just wonderin

[Aug 26-07 21:52:18]Yang <fighter> woot
[Aug 29-07 16:9:14]Tai <fighter> hrmm so antis have shimmer, maybe pallies should have one too but opposite?
[Aug 31-07 20:9:6]Tai <fighter> wow skills expensive
[Sep 1-07 3:40:30]Tai <fighter> mysticblade worked for me a lower lvls but not now?
[Sep 4-07 18:10:47]Yang <fighter> warcry only effects enemies, think we need something like a type of chant to affect us as warriors
[Sep 5-07 20:2:14]Yang <fighter> CURSE!

[Sep 24-07 19:37:2]Nikkolas <fighter> what is best weapon for newbie?
[Sep 24-07 19:37:38]Oz <fighter> newbie weapons. you are a warrior, so swords will be your primary weapon of choosing. look around the tirun square. you'll see a little guy naked rejik. buy 4 newbie swords from him. they're only one gold each
[Sep 24-07 19:37:40]Nikkolas <fighter> gawd im lost used to things i can actually see
[Sep 24-07 19:37:54]Nikkolas <fighter> ahh thanks man
[Sep 24-07 19:38:6]Oz <fighter> don't mention it, i don't like ot be known as a nice person.
[Sep 24-07 19:38:10]Oz <fighter> to*
[Sep 24-07 19:38:24]Nikkolas <fighter> okay i wont spread it round
[Sep 24-07 19:38:55]Nikkolas <fighter> this rejik is naked??
[Sep 24-07 19:39:15]Oz <fighter> yeah, most npc's are. (npc = non player character)
[Sep 24-07 19:39:25]Nikkolas <fighter> i see
[Sep 24-07 20:24:14]Valner <fighter> some, a while ago
[Sep 24-07 20:25:8]Valner <fighter> been so long, i don't remember where the subhalls are
[Sep 24-07 20:25:26]Valner <fighter> newbie map just shows the class hall
[Sep 24-07 20:27:4]Valner <fighter> typo in help paladin
[Sep 24-07 20:33:24]Valner <fighter> there's no down exit in the monastary, even though the description says the stairs go to both the attic and the basement?
[Sep 24-07 20:35:28]Valner <fighter> hospital?
[Sep 24-07 20:40:12]Valner <fighter> other than the clergy hall too?
[Sep 24-07 21:0:20]Valner <fighter> it reset the skills i had trained up...
[Sep 24-07 21:16:58]Valner <fighter> didn't find the abandoned church - its inside tirun walls?
[Sep 24-07 21:18:16]Valner <fighter> never played either here
[Sep 25-07 21:45:39]Yang <fighter> my theory is that if i get strong enough for whirl, id be the first fighter to be able to xp efficiently with whirl doing area dmg
[Sep 25-07 21:46:7]Yang <fighter> but i know its a high lvl attack
[Sep 25-07 21:46:23]Yang <fighter> hehe yeah compliments on your rush Nul
[Sep 25-07 21:46:49]Yang <fighter> before you it wasnt even worth using
[Sep 25-07 21:46:55]Yang <fighter> nother form of jab
[Sep 25-07 22:24:42]Yang <fighter> haha forgot to sharpen weapons
[Sep 27-07 21:15:36]Oz <fighter> are you teaking it right now nul?

[Oct 2-07 22:46:54]Oz <fighter> yo nul, i was wondering if you could look into somethin' for me?
[Oct 2-07 22:47:46]Oz <fighter> i noticed that the rage specials, like the 'your eyes light up instilling fear' and 'cleave your opponet' rarely happens, and i was wondering if that was right, if it should occur more?
[Oct 2-07 22:48:10]Oz <fighter> i can kill some stuff for you if you like, to see?
[Oct 2-07 22:49:4]Oz <fighter> ah, alright, my bad then. yeah, i did notice they were good.
[Oct 10-07 17:25:50]Yang <fighter> wow i only slice Treggeth now... wow downgrade... badddd... :(
[Oct 10-07 17:28:14]Yang <fighter> yeah.. was talking about the change from back then, its koo though, just gotta get stronger i guess
[Oct 10-07 17:28:30]Yang <fighter> ive been using rush ever since
[Oct 14-07 1:14:12]Strom <fighter> Nulvect are you there?
[Oct 14-07 1:15:54]Strom <fighter> I was wondering why Spears cant be sharpend?
[Oct 14-07 1:16:34]Strom <fighter> nod
[Oct 14-07 1:16:38]Rommel <fighter> we can shapern stuff
[Oct 14-07 1:17:14]Strom <fighter> oh
[Oct 14-07 1:17:34]Strom <fighter> that would make sence
[Oct 14-07 1:17:40]Rommel <fighter> don't do it
[Oct 14-07 1:17:52]Strom <fighter> why not?
[Oct 14-07 1:18:0]Rommel <fighter> more training of skills
[Oct 14-07 1:18:6]Strom <fighter> ....
[Oct 14-07 1:18:20]Strom <fighter> ahh nod
[Oct 14-07 1:18:56]Strom <fighter> so I would loose the throw ability unless i trained thrown?
[Oct 14-07 1:19:28]Rommel <fighter> the commands are beautiful
[Oct 14-07 1:19:30]Strom <fighter> ok, i guess for the over sake of on skill
[Oct 14-07 1:19:36]Strom <fighter> well, ability
[Oct 14-07 1:19:44]Strom <fighter> itss a lot of work heh
[Oct 14-07 1:19:48]Strom <fighter> never mind then :)
[Oct 14-07 1:19:56]Strom <fighter> it was just a thought
[Oct 14-07 1:20:14]Rommel <fighter> Nul don't change it u have better things to worry about
[Oct 14-07 1:20:28]<fighter> Nulvect shrugs
[Oct 14-07 1:20:28]Rommel <fighter> like the new area :P
[Oct 14-07 1:20:46]Strom <fighter> sounding a bit selish there rommel
[Oct 14-07 1:21:10]Rommel <fighter> the area is for the good of the community
[Oct 14-07 1:48:7]Strom <fighter> I hope the better I get at this the more I make .... else this is meh
[Oct 14-07 1:51:31]Strom <fighter> hey Nulvect
[Oct 14-07 1:59:41]Strom <fighter> as my skill in makeing stuff goes up. WIll I make more arrows at a time?
[Oct 14-07 2:8:59]Strom <fighter> humm
[Oct 14-07 2:9:7]Strom <fighter> what about slavaging arrows from corpses?
[Oct 14-07 2:9:49]Strom <fighter> using a bow is heeps fun
[Oct 14-07 2:9:57]Strom <fighter> maken arrows is a pain tho
[Oct 14-07 2:10:3]Strom <fighter> tho fun as well.
[Oct 14-07 2:15:23]Strom <fighter> might just be too low level atm to worry about maken arrows and stuff
[Oct 14-07 2:16:35]Strom <fighter> yes and no
[Oct 14-07 2:17:9]Strom <fighter> can only hold 24 arrows at once
[Oct 14-07 2:18:9]Strom <fighter> You use all the arrows up in 2-3 fights
[Oct 14-07 2:19:11]Strom <fighter> oh, no doubt.
[Oct 14-07 2:19:27]Strom <fighter> thats why i bought up the idea of getting back arrows
[Oct 14-07 2:20:15]Strom <fighter> nod
[Oct 14-07 2:20:29]Strom <fighter> I find it more fun blasting away with arrows
[Oct 14-07 2:20:39]Strom <fighter> having to make them my self makes it more fun
[Oct 14-07 2:20:59]Strom <fighter> feel more involved with the characters development rather then.. xp grind
[Oct 14-07 2:21:31]Strom <fighter> oh i did read it
[Oct 14-07 2:21:45]Strom <fighter> but it does more dmg then my normal attack :p
[Oct 14-07 2:22:3]Strom <fighter> but regardless
[Oct 14-07 2:22:15]Strom <fighter> the revlaiming of arrows would be neat
[Oct 14-07 2:23:55]Strom <fighter> am hoping there are some proj abilites other then impale
[Oct 14-07 2:24:13]Strom <fighter> it would be refreshing to see omthing other then a sword using fighter class :S
[Oct 14-07 2:25:33]Strom <fighter> nods
[Oct 14-07 2:25:51]Strom <fighter> i have gone back to jue shooten them till they come after me :p
[Oct 14-07 2:33:8]Strom <fighter> nulvect
[Oct 14-07 2:33:12]Strom <fighter> I have an idea
[Oct 14-07 2:33:46]Strom <fighter> would it be possable to modify the make arrows to be more like make <numer> arrows?
[Oct 14-07 2:33:58]Strom <fighter> but still use the required amout of mats?
[Oct 14-07 2:34:18]Strom <fighter> hmmm its prolly better as it is
[Oct 14-07 2:34:36]Strom <fighter> id say am going to make more arrows the better i get at this each attempt
[Oct 14-07 2:34:40]Micky <fighter> there are arrorws?
[Oct 14-07 2:35:10]Strom <fighter> nods
[Oct 14-07 2:35:16]Strom <fighter> its prolly ok
[Oct 14-07 2:36:42]Micky <fighter> when the bleep did we get ice cream
[Oct 14-07 2:38:18]Strom <fighter> ooooh...
[Oct 14-07 2:40:26]Strom <fighter> its neat wearing and useing stuff ya have made
[Oct 14-07 2:41:44]Strom <fighter> nods
[Oct 14-07 2:41:56]Strom <fighter> Felt like being human. You dont see many Humans
[Oct 22-07 23:31:4]Skunk <fighter> we can't rage while buffed?
[Oct 22-07 23:39:14]Skunk <fighter> hey nul? we can't rage while buffed?
[Oct 22-07 23:39:40]Skunk <fighter> that's no fun :(
[Oct 22-07 23:40:28]Skunk <fighter> yea, that would be a little much, maybe take 50% of each?
[Oct 22-07 23:41:14]Skunk <fighter> just seems kinda silly to not be able to use what we are most famous for
[Oct 22-07 23:41:16]Skunk <fighter> ;)
[Oct 23-07 22:23:21]Yang <fighter> and Yang should have an insta charge... hehe
[Oct 23-07 22:29:55]Yang <fighter> any new ideas for warriors Nul?
[Oct 23-07 22:30:17]Yang <fighter> kool
[Oct 23-07 22:30:33]Yang <fighter> anything for under hm???
[Oct 24-07 3:23:15]Skunk <fighter> i have no complaints, i was actually just thinking that ointments do a little too much
[Oct 24-07 3:23:37]Skunk <fighter> but i know i won't think that at higher levels
[Oct 24-07 3:23:41]<fighter> Skunk winks.
[Oct 24-07 3:25:57]<fighter> Skunk nods.
[Oct 24-07 3:26:11]Skunk <fighter> any way to loosely base them off levels?
[Oct 24-07 3:26:25]Skunk <fighter> so they do more sp the higher level you are?
[Oct 24-07 3:26:49]Skunk <fighter> or even how much dex you have, or some sort of combo of em
[Oct 24-07 3:27:7]<fighter> Nulvect shrugs
[Oct 24-07 3:27:31]Skunk <fighter> i'm just scared of what you will do with monks when you get there :P
[Oct 24-07 3:28:7]Skunk <fighter> no, i'm scared i'll be screwed as a demon :P
[Oct 24-07 3:29:47]Skunk <fighter> i can't use a lot of my monk stuff right cause of my alignment, but i get plenty of xp with the physical abils, if you make monks super alignment based, i'm up the creek
[Oct 24-07 3:30:9]Skunk <fighter> hopefully enough physical stuff to make up for the spells ;)
[Oct 24-07 3:30:47]Skunk <fighter> otherwise i might have to pay a cleric to get resurrect ;)
[Oct 24-07 3:31:1]Skunk <fighter> maybe get some stuff like sweeps and pins?
[Oct 24-07 3:32:1]Skunk <fighter> cool, i just can't wait for furystrike to hit consistently, unless you are taking it out?
[Oct 24-07 3:34:35]Skunk <fighter> also think oils still heal too much body damage
[Oct 24-07 3:37:11]Skunk <fighter> i still don't have to worry about body damage
[Oct 24-07 3:38:15]<fighter> Skunk nods.
[Oct 24-07 3:38:35]Skunk <fighter> make people actually pay attention when they xp ;)
[Oct 30-07 15:35:10]Yang <fighter> man i want whirl

[Dec 7-07 19:36:18]Yang <fighter> yeah they do good damage , sever alot when you rage with ancients
[Dec 7-07 19:36:28]Aldhissla <fighter> xp with rage useful?
[Dec 7-07 19:36:34]Yang <fighter> nope
[Dec 7-07 19:36:52]Aldhissla <fighter> lol, so they do good damage when you rage but you dont xp with rage, you use it to show off arena
[Dec 7-07 19:36:54]Yang <fighter> thats why 1 hand axe other hand sword, cause you can charge
[Dec 7-07 19:37:4]Aldhissla <fighter> can charge with axes

[Dec 12-07 21:53:32]Yang <fighter> Nul!
[Dec 12-07 21:53:36]Yang <fighter> yay
[Dec 12-07 21:53:40]Yang <fighter> i have an idea
[Dec 12-07 21:54:14]Yang <fighter> it aint much and you might have already thought of it and ... yeah
[Dec 12-07 21:55:0]Yang <fighter> but when fighters, at the correct skill lvl , compare, it might wanna show how much better it is to the other object....example: sword 2 MUCH better than sword 4
[Dec 12-07 21:55:21]Yang <fighter> if its not that much better it can mbe a small much
[Dec 12-07 21:55:25]Yang <fighter> whatcha think?

[Dec 16-07 13:49:11]Yang <fighter> always wondered if pallies should get some sort of regen spell
[Dec 16-07 13:49:41]Skrymer <fighter> would be cool
[Dec 16-07 13:49:51]Skrymer <fighter> we should have auras :D
[Dec 16-07 13:49:59]Yang <fighter> there ya go
[Dec 16-07 13:50:13]Skrymer <fighter> offensive/defensive/passive
[Dec 16-07 13:50:21]Skrymer <fighter> specialize in a branch
[Dec 16-07 13:50:25]Yang <fighter> i could see that
[Dec 16-07 13:51:27]Skrymer <fighter> and certain auras could automatically affect party mates as long as in party

[Dec 28-07 22:8:11]Yang <fighter> lies
[Dec 28-07 22:10:41]Skrymer <fighter> wait idk if you can answer this but uhh do you mean rage was meant for xping with?
[Dec 28-07 22:11:17]Skrymer <fighter> cuz im not jokin i really thought it was just like a show off abil
[Dec 28-07 22:12:17]Skrymer <fighter> k so in a sense its like a berserkers way of not havin to always use charge?
[Dec 28-07 22:12:29]Yang <fighter> hrmm
[Dec 28-07 22:12:43]Yang <fighter> true true
[Dec 28-07 22:13:19]Yang <fighter> dont have to lvl up... hehehe just thought i throw that one in
[Dec 28-07 22:13:37]Skrymer <fighter> well i know we dont have to i just always noticed that rage was more slower than charging when trying to xp
[Dec 28-07 22:13:49]Skrymer <fighter> maybe im lookin at it the wrong angle
[Dec 28-07 22:14:5]Skrymer <fighter> gotta draw myself a diagram, yang, pen please :P
[Dec 28-07 22:14:31]Yang <fighter> no no no no
[Dec 28-07 22:14:37]Skrymer <fighter> lol, i think =everyone= thinks that about charge :p
[Dec 28-07 22:14:39]Yang <fighter> charge is good
[Dec 28-07 22:14:43]Yang <fighter> doh
[Dec 28-07 22:14:45]Skrymer <fighter> charge is great
[Dec 28-07 22:15:9]Yang <fighter> nod nod nod
[Dec 28-07 22:15:27]Skrymer <fighter> but i dont think all fighters wanna have charge as their base abil and it tends to always end up like so
[Dec 28-07 22:15:27]Yang <fighter> Skry lets get some firebreathers in your system and lets see your rage man
[Dec 28-07 22:16:9]Yang <fighter> hehe some dragons can rage
[Dec 28-07 22:16:15]Yang <fighter> scary
[Dec 28-07 22:16:25]Skrymer <fighter> yeh but dragon rage pwns ours :p ive seen spade do it
[Dec 28-07 22:16:33]Yang <fighter> wow never seen that
[Dec 28-07 22:16:43]Skrymer <fighter> his fire abils kickin in and his dragon rush knockin ppl down :p
[Dec 28-07 22:17:5]Skrymer <fighter> that'd be tight if zerks could pull that off id be like SHA_BAM in yo face drag-son!
[Dec 28-07 22:17:11]Yang <fighter> is there a way Nul that we can set certain moves in rage?
[Dec 28-07 22:17:19]Skrymer <fighter> lol you cant control rage
[Dec 28-07 22:17:25]Skrymer <fighter> or maybe im wrong :P
[Dec 28-07 22:17:37]Yang <fighter> like have 2 moves in rage, like rush and pummel where you have 75% chance more to do those moves
[Dec 28-07 22:17:47]Yang <fighter> oh ok nm
[Dec 28-07 22:17:49]Skrymer <fighter> lol you can r ush in rage!
[Dec 28-07 22:17:57]Skrymer <fighter> i doubt that one :P
[Dec 28-07 22:18:9]Skrymer <fighter> but that dragon rage would be awesomez id so go red :p
[Dec 28-07 22:19:45]Skrymer <fighter> o.0 idea yang, maybe rage is meant only when you one hit k-o teh mobletz
[Dec 28-07 22:19:49]Skrymer <fighter> miss lol
[Dec 28-07 22:22:17]Skrymer <fighter> kk
[Dec 28-07 23:48:51]Skrymer <fighter> woah
[Dec 28-07 23:52:55]Skrymer <fighter> nada
[Dec 28-07 23:53:1]Skrymer <fighter> whats up with ya
[Dec 29-07 19:26:21]Aldhissla <fighter> nul was wondering if berserkers deserve a lil more on the flail skill? perhaps equivalent to the sword/axe/blunt
[Dec 29-07 19:36:1]Aldhissla <fighter> well i always imagined them to carry a flail and axe of some sort swingin around
[Dec 29-07 19:39:37]Aldhissla <fighter> for me it was like the blunt class for paladins, always imagined them with scepters, antipaladins would more than likely be flail, berserkers and warriors would <almost) be on par with warriors 'cept berserkers dont really use teh projectiles/spears/knife type of thing
[Dec 29-07 19:41:39]Aldhissla <fighter> was imagining more of the type of bola swinging flail rather opposed to the morning star ninjutsu thing lol
[Dec 29-07 19:44:5]Aldhissla <fighter> and morning stars should be more projectiles :P or in a thrown skill of some sort
[Dec 29-07 20:2:52]Aldhissla <fighter> lol was thinkin those throwin stars
[Dec 29-07 20:4:0]Aldhissla <fighter> yep hopefully ppl put in some weapon for those types
[Dec 29-07 20:4:58]Aldhissla <fighter> well i dont think you throw em
[Dec 29-07 20:5:6]Aldhissla <fighter> you just swing em around

[Jan 6-08 1:57:4]Kilrog <fighter> Nulvect
[Jan 6-08 1:57:12]Kilrog <fighter> ok
[Jan 6-08 1:57:58]Kilrog <fighter> a moment of ya time
[Jan 6-08 1:58:10]Kilrog <fighter> Warcry. Is it in the game?
[Jan 6-08 1:58:26]<fighter> Kilrog nods
[Jan 6-08 1:58:42]Rommel <fighter> whats its purpose
[Jan 6-08 1:58:54]Kilrog <fighter> sounds like a debuff
[Jan 6-08 1:59:2]Rommel <fighter> ummm
[Jan 6-08 1:59:34]Kilrog <fighter> help files a bit vague about who gets it. But i guess a warrior would
[Jan 6-08 2:0:7]Kilrog <fighter> berserkers
[Jan 6-08 2:0:19]Kilrog <fighter> okies
[Jan 6-08 2:0:23]Rommel <fighter> is it new?
[Jan 6-08 2:0:57]Kilrog <fighter> berserkers have Ferocity
[Jan 6-08 2:1:7]Rommel <fighter> it is supposed to faze enemies
[Jan 6-08 2:1:23]Rommel <fighter> sounds kinda paralyzing
[Jan 6-08 2:1:29]Rommel <fighter> if done right
[Jan 6-08 2:2:9]Kilrog <fighter> id say berserkers
[Jan 6-08 2:2:57]Rommel <fighter> i just learned to hate turtles
[Jan 6-08 2:3:13]Kilrog <fighter> .....
[Jan 6-08 2:3:41]Kilrog <fighter> Nulvect
[Jan 6-08 2:4:1]Kilrog <fighter> when y alook over Warriors, are you thinking about makeing more abils in the same way as gash?
[Jan 6-08 2:4:57]Kilrog <fighter> wicked
[Jan 6-08 2:6:33]Kilrog <fighter> in the area of having attacks?
[Jan 6-08 2:7:13]Kilrog <fighter> I dont think I got anything at elite
[Jan 6-08 2:7:53]Kilrog <fighter> ahh
[Jan 6-08 2:8:7]Kilrog <fighter> humm...
[Jan 6-08 2:8:21]Kilrog <fighter> i suppose, seeing as most people will only ever find the best one and only use that one
[Jan 6-08 2:8:47]Kilrog <fighter> but then again, when new weapons surfacxe in new zones, they might change abils
[Jan 6-08 2:14:35]<fighter> Kilrog cheers
[Jan 6-08 3:0:49]Kilrog <fighter> humm
[Jan 6-08 4:23:21]Kilrog <fighter> the dmg chages does effected by what weapons you have wielded?
[Jan 6-08 4:24:7]Rommel <fighter> u want to test it
[Jan 6-08 4:24:25]Kilrog <fighter> i'll test it over there wew i am
[Jan 6-08 4:24:41]Kilrog <fighter> just need a mob i dont insta
[Jan 6-08 4:26:3]Kilrog <fighter> wonder what fighter abil nul was gonna make
[Jan 7-08 15:31:20]Yang <fighter> dunno what to say bout the carge change, i guess we will just have to see now
[Jan 7-08 15:31:28]Yang <fighter> charge*
[Jan 7-08 15:33:18]Yang <fighter> cant we make charge 1 round for all races?
[Jan 7-08 15:34:30]Yang <fighter> i mean ow good is making rogues 1 round bs mages 1 round spell but charge being 2 rounds due to everyone else being a non- raknid/centaur/weimic
[Jan 7-08 18:42:50]Rommel <fighter> the question about charge is how much more damage
[Jan 7-08 18:43:30]Rommel <fighter> can't be a little bit more damage but reasonable
[Jan 7-08 18:43:38]Rommel <fighter> amount
[Jan 7-08 21:50:3]Rommel <fighter> ummmmmmmm
[Jan 7-08 21:50:9]Rommel <fighter> u there Nul
[Jan 7-08 21:55:36]Rommel <fighter> i was wondering about this change to charge
[Jan 7-08 21:56:32]Rommel <fighter> if ur opponent lands there attack on u and ur still charging does it cancel out ur charge?
[Jan 7-08 21:58:34]Rommel <fighter> i mean since they already land their attack on u and charge is only a opening move
[Jan 7-08 22:1:22]Rommel <fighter> i mean if charge is changed to 2 rounds that makes it unfair to ppl that land their attack first
[Jan 7-08 22:3:16]Rommel <fighter> i have tried all the other moves of fighters and they are all weak
[Jan 7-08 22:5:31]Yang <fighter> so Nul i mean if charge wont be the move to xp with what will be?
[Jan 7-08 22:6:37]Rommel <fighter> whats a good one?
[Jan 7-08 22:6:41]Yang <fighter> i have decent str and dex dont think gash will do it fer me
[Jan 7-08 22:6:47]Yang <fighter> rush is a 2 round
[Jan 7-08 22:7:13]Rommel <fighter> rush takes a couple more rounds before it can be used again
[Jan 7-08 22:8:7]Yang <fighter> ive tried to insta things with my gash/ headbutt slash... that dont work too well
[Jan 7-08 22:8:29]Rommel <fighter> plus rush misses alot if u don't have dex
[Jan 7-08 22:8:35]<fighter> Yang nods
[Jan 7-08 22:10:37]Yang <fighter> if thats the case and if all of charge will be 2 round dakzhul, backstab and other initials should be 2 round
[Jan 7-08 22:11:11]Yang <fighter> well i could spend 3-4 rounds on a 50 k mob or i could kill 2 25ks in 2 round
[Jan 7-08 22:13:15]Yang <fighter> i just dont understand thouhg i know the big picture is to make everyone lvl and get stronger with skills and not so muchstats, but is that really right for us as a mud?
[Jan 7-08 22:13:29]Yang <fighter> i know it may not be my place but its just that i have some concerns
[Jan 7-08 22:15:17]Rommel <fighter> i have no problem with other fighters getting one round charge
[Jan 7-08 22:15:33]Yang <fighter> my demon did quite well, and truefully its the person that chooses the race
[Jan 7-08 22:16:9]Rommel <fighter> i didn't really choose centaur thinking about that i just like there cons and strength stats
[Jan 7-08 22:17:59]Yang <fighter> is the problem that there are too many centaur/ raknid/ and weimic fighters? if so we should do something about elves and illithids being mages
[Jan 7-08 22:18:11]Yang <fighter> maybe even demons being rogues
[Jan 7-08 22:18:33]Yang <fighter> they do start off with freakishly big stats
[Jan 7-08 22:19:23]Yang <fighter> besieds me and Rommie i really dont see a mass amount of fighters... but you see more than we do
[Jan 7-08 22:20:1]Yang <fighter> maybe they are being created but never soght through cause they do get hard later on
[Jan 7-08 22:20:15]Yang <fighter> maybe just increasing the cost of charging skills
[Jan 7-08 22:20:37]Yang <fighter> or increasing dex vs npc
[Jan 7-08 22:21:57]Yang <fighter> well im out lets talk more about this Nul when i have more time ok?
[Jan 9-08 5:24:30]Kilrog <fighter> Havent notcied any Differnce to Charge
[Jan 9-08 13:54:6]Yang <fighter> so when do the changes occur?
[Jan 9-08 14:21:34]Yang <fighter> i always wondered if 4 legged or charge races should get charge but non charge races should get something like trample
[Jan 9-08 14:22:42]Yang <fighter> they be equal in power but one be more dex based and the other str based
[Jan 11-08 16:15:1]Yang <fighter> gash wasnt changed right?
[Jan 11-08 16:15:17]Yang <fighter> k
[Jan 11-08 16:15:37]Yang <fighter> it must be the weapons im wielding
[Jan 11-08 19:7:6]Kilrog <fighter> Nulvect
[Jan 11-08 19:7:26]Kilrog <fighter> Any changes to Charge yet
[Jan 11-08 19:9:26]Kilrog <fighter> nods

[Jan 14-08 20:52:38]Noelani <fighter> origin, and its meaning is "mist of heaven". Noe (noh-AY) means "mist, misty rain".

[Jan 14-08 20:55:52]<fighter> Noelani won't look
[Jan 14-08 20:55:58]Yang <fighter> hehe
[Jan 14-08 20:56:18]Noelani <fighter> some names on that site are funny
[Jan 14-08 20:56:42]Yang <fighter> hehe i know Nul was gonna apply a random name thingy here too
[Jan 14-08 20:57:0]Noelani <fighter> that's a good idea
[Jan 14-08 20:57:4]Noelani <fighter> how about Endverimhineng?
[Jan 14-08 20:57:20]Noelani <fighter> Peremtorskelight
[Jan 14-08 20:57:26]Yang <fighter> thats good stuff, hard name to pk
[Jan 14-08 20:57:30]Noelani <fighter> yes
[Jan 14-08 20:57:42]Noelani <fighter> that's under very long names
[Jan 21-08 14:50:16]Yang <fighter> speakin of which i havent seen the warrior board in a while
[Jan 21-08 14:50:30]Yang <fighter> now if i could just remember where it is
[Feb 1-08 20:29:4]Yang <fighter> ya know
[Feb 1-08 20:29:8]Yang <fighter> i was thinking
[Feb 1-08 20:29:16]Yang <fighter> a dangerous thing... yes i know
[Feb 1-08 20:30:12]Yang <fighter> seeing that rogues have the ability to unlock lock doors.... was wonderin if we fighters... aka me and Rommie (hehehe) should be able to break or ram doors open
[Feb 1-08 20:57:40]Yang <fighter> hehe okie
[Feb 1-08 21:18:40]Yang <fighter> thats true Nul, i hear ya about keeping rougish things strickly ... well rogue
[Feb 1-08 21:19:12]<fighter> Yang just really hates that dude in merk that hogs the starscreams
[Feb 1-08 22:0:0]Yang <fighter> awwwwww
[Feb 1-08 22:0:4]<fighter> Yang cries
[Feb 1-08 22:0:44]Yang <fighter> so 2 rounds for everyone right?
[Feb 1-08 22:0:48]Yang <fighter> k
[Feb 1-08 22:1:14]Yang <fighter> prob after reboot?
[Feb 1-08 22:1:40]<fighter> Yang cries
[Feb 1-08 22:2:52]Yang <fighter> lol , just lreaized, people who didnt hear that will prob blame it on the lag... LOL
[Feb 2-08 2:17:11]Yang <fighter> this is gonna be bad huh..
[Feb 2-08 2:20:53]Yang <fighter> thought raknids centaurs and weimics charges were gonna be stronger though
[Feb 2-08 2:25:23]Yang <fighter> so are you still thinking about making charge be a single round at a higher skill lvl?
[Feb 2-08 2:29:7]<fighter> Yang wonders what non charging fighters use to xp
[Feb 2-08 2:29:43]Yang <fighter> nah... slash, gash all too weak
[Feb 2-08 2:29:55]Yang <fighter> unless they are all skill based
[Feb 2-08 2:29:57]Yang <fighter> hrmm
[Feb 2-08 2:30:47]Yang <fighter> i just think due to my stats lvl, i should at least be able to insta a 25k
[Feb 2-08 2:31:43]<fighter> Yang nods
[Feb 2-08 2:31:59]Yang <fighter> i guess i have to lvl then
[Feb 2-08 2:32:15]Yang <fighter> never wanted to lvl
[Feb 2-08 2:33:29]Yang <fighter> any new ideas for warriors?
[Feb 2-08 2:35:23]Yang <fighter> hehe kool
[Feb 2-08 2:35:39]<fighter> Yang the door slayer
[Feb 2-08 2:36:57]Yang <fighter> ooo oo thats what i was gonna ask about
[Feb 2-08 2:37:1]Yang <fighter> trample
[Feb 2-08 2:38:3]Yang <fighter> like a weak charge but hits 2 people
[Feb 2-08 2:38:15]Yang <fighter> hrmm wait that dont sound good
[Feb 2-08 2:39:1]Yang <fighter> trust me it sounded better earlier talin to myself
[Feb 2-08 12:52:13]Yang <fighter> bah i would have stayed a demon if i knew it was gona be changed
[Feb 4-08 18:13:41]<fighter> Rommel will always remain loyal to fighters
[Feb 8-08 14:45:53]Yang <fighter> really trynna make fighter work after the downgrade
[Feb 8-08 15:0:33]Yang <fighter> just wondering, do you think that a lvl 19 should ever be able to insta a 25 k?
[Feb 8-08 15:0:53]Yang <fighter> i mean sure if you have rediculous stats and all
[Feb 8-08 15:1:31]Yang <fighter> but like an average player at lvl 19 with decent stats
[Feb 8-08 15:1:37]Yang <fighter> and maxed skills
[Feb 8-08 15:3:21]Yang <fighter> hrmm i guess im playing the wrong subclass
[Feb 8-08 15:3:39]Yang <fighter> or class all together

[Mar 4-08 21:34:8]Yang <fighter> did i ever mention my hilt idea? prob did, where you , during combat, circle around your enemy and hit him in the back of the head with the blunt part of your sword,...
[Mar 4-08 21:36:16]Yang <fighter>  the lack of convo just ensures me that that idea sux

[Mar 16-08 2:18:7]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^*gets a warm fuzzy feeling*
[Mar 19-08 0:19:21]Rommel <fighter> that sucks
[Mar 19-08 0:22:3]Rommel <fighter> hrmm is it worth it to lvl
[Mar 20-08 13:15:36]Yang <fighter> k another dorkie idea swimming around in my head here, leap slash, takes 2 rounds , like how rush does fighter jumps in the air(round 1) then plummets his weapon or burries his weapon in his/her enemies torso/neck/head/etc... Lemme know whatcha think Nul...
[Mar 21-08 1:15:18]Rommel <fighter> is that the new spell?
[Mar 21-08 1:15:44]Rommel <fighter> hrmm makes me want to lvl
[Mar 21-08 1:16:0]Rommel <fighter> must resist the urge
[Mar 21-08 1:16:8]Nulvect <fighter> it won't hurt you
[Mar 21-08 1:16:44]Rommel <fighter> i am just super happy right now
[Mar 21-08 1:16:54]Nulvect <fighter> why??
[Mar 21-08 1:17:8]Rommel <fighter> i got into UCLA
[Mar 21-08 1:17:18]Nulvect <fighter> ahhh, cool
[Mar 21-08 1:17:30]Nulvect <fighter> what major??
[Mar 21-08 1:17:42]Rommel <fighter> econ
[Mar 21-08 1:17:56]Nulvect <fighter> ooh, sounds boring
[Mar 21-08 1:18:20]Rommel <fighter> i applied to most places under different majors lol
[Mar 21-08 1:18:52]Rommel <fighter> not really sure what to do
[Mar 21-08 1:19:12]Rommel <fighter> leaning more towards history/business
[Mar 21-08 1:19:20]Nulvect <fighter> well, just pick something you can stand to study for four years straight
[Mar 21-08 1:19:50]Rommel <fighter> sounds soo long
[Mar 21-08 1:20:12]Nulvect <fighter> same length as high school
[Mar 21-08 1:20:28]Rommel <fighter> but 100 times better :P
[Mar 21-08 1:20:44]Nulvect <fighter> most likely
[Mar 21-08 1:21:8]Rommel <fighter> next stop the real world
[Mar 21-08 1:22:4]Nulvect <fighter> just remember the golden rule of life: you can't trust anybody
[Mar 21-08 1:23:18]<fighter> Rommel will remember that
[Mar 21-08 1:23:32]Rommel <fighter> sounds like u have experienced it
[Mar 21-08 1:24:8]Nulvect <fighter> a bit
[Mar 21-08 1:25:2]Rommel <fighter> sad rule but very true
[Mar 21-08 1:25:46]Nulvect <fighter> I may just be a bit jaded, but at least assuming the worst makes you prepared :P
[Mar 21-08 1:25:56]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^also makes u cynical
[Mar 21-08 1:26:26]Rommel <fighter> lol
[Mar 21-08 1:26:48]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^people can betray you, easy. Just be sure u got a good one
[Mar 21-08 1:27:6]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^know someone before you think you know them and you'll be ok
[Mar 21-08 1:27:42]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^also, friends and money dont mix.
[Mar 21-08 1:27:50]Rommel <fighter> i hear that
[Mar 21-08 1:27:52]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^also, roommates and money dont mix.
[Mar 21-08 1:28:14]Rommel <fighter> i'll remember that for the fall
[Mar 21-08 1:28:52]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^better yet, dont lend what u cant afford to give.
[Mar 21-08 1:29:18]Nulvect <fighter> debt is bad
[Mar 21-08 1:30:2]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^also, resentment and envy bred like wildfire. If you have nice stuff, keep it locked away
[Mar 21-08 1:31:8]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^get a good secure trunk with a solid padlock.
[Mar 21-08 1:31:24]Nulvect <fighter> I agree... what little nice stuff a college student is likely to have should be locked up
[Mar 21-08 1:31:40]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^*works at a college and sees so many people robbed by people they think they can trust*
[Mar 21-08 1:31:42]Ayesha <fighter> what's the discussion?
[Mar 21-08 1:31:52]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^Rommel's off to UCLA in the fall
[Mar 21-08 1:32:0]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^we're giving him advice. :)
[Mar 21-08 1:32:9]Ayesha <fighter> ahh
[Mar 21-08 1:32:41]Ayesha <fighter> --> what kind of advice?
[Mar 21-08 1:32:51]Rommel <fighter> general
[Mar 21-08 1:32:57]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^be careful trusting new people. some can be nice, some can be users, etc.
[Mar 21-08 1:33:9]Ayesha <fighter> -> yep
[Mar 21-08 1:33:23]Nulvect <fighter> heh, "users"
[Mar 21-08 1:33:35]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^Nulvect = cynic
[Mar 21-08 1:33:55]Rommel <fighter> real world = crazy
[Mar 21-08 1:33:57]<fighter> Nulvect nods
[Mar 21-08 1:34:15]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^peoples' true colors show when they think no one is watching.
[Mar 21-08 1:34:31]Ayesha <fighter> < hard not to believe in people >
[Mar 21-08 1:34:33]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^so watch them in those situations to learn what they're all about
[Mar 21-08 1:34:39]Rommel <fighter> true dat
[Mar 21-08 1:35:3]Nulvect <fighter> heh, people don't change much though
[Mar 21-08 1:35:25]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^and some folks can be trusted to a point.
[Mar 21-08 1:35:41]Ayesha <fighter> < it's hard, because you want to think the best of everyone >
[Mar 21-08 1:35:55]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^the guy u can trust with your cell phone isnt always the guy you can trust with your laptop
[Mar 21-08 1:35:55]Rommel <fighter> trust folks but don't trust with everything
[Mar 21-08 1:36:9]Nulvect <fighter> bah don't trust people
[Mar 21-08 1:36:27]Nulvect <fighter> trust is earned on a personal basis
[Mar 21-08 1:36:27]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^dont discount instinct or your inner voice
[Mar 21-08 1:36:47]<fighter> Rommel has a feeling Nul doesn't trust us
[Mar 21-08 1:37:5]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^Nulvect may still be weary of his mama.
[Mar 21-08 1:37:17]Nulvect <fighter> hmm??
[Mar 21-08 1:37:49]Nulvect <fighter> I trust most players to play here and not exploit bugs and stuff
[Mar 21-08 1:37:59]Nulvect <fighter> I wouldn't trust you to use my computer though
[Mar 21-08 1:38:5]Rommel <fighter> rofl
[Mar 21-08 1:38:33]<fighter> Rommel cloaks then starts to use Nul's computer
[Mar 21-08 1:39:15]Nulvect <fighter> well, I have a rather... obtuse... desktop...
[Mar 21-08 1:39:23]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^pr0n?
[Mar 21-08 1:39:31]Nulvect <fighter> nah
[Mar 21-08 1:39:39]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^kittens?
[Mar 21-08 1:40:21]Nulvect <fighter> no window titlebars/icons, multiple desktops, no visible way to manage any of it
[Mar 21-08 1:40:29]Ki <fighter> %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^<%^GREEN%^%^BOLD%^G%^BLACK%^B> %^YELLOW%^I bet Nulvect's desktop is a kitten on a rope dangling with the phrase 'Hang on, Baby!'
[Mar 21-08 1:40:39]Rommel <fighter> lol
[Mar 21-08 1:40:49]Nulvect <fighter> oh, background?? solid black

[Apr 10-08 22:3:49]Yang <fighter> booo
[Apr 11-08 16:35:55]Yang <fighter> wonder if rangers could electrically charge arrows or just use electric eels tto make them .. you know from their bones and stuff
[Apr 11-08 16:36:11]Nulvect <fighter> ...
[Apr 11-08 16:36:21]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^hmm
[Apr 11-08 16:36:23]Yang <fighter> ok ok that was far fetched
[Apr 11-08 16:36:31]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^fire would be better. :)
[Apr 11-08 16:36:35]Yang <fighter> hehe
[Apr 11-08 16:36:39]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^lantern + arrows = PAIN
[Apr 11-08 16:36:43]Yang <fighter> skin a pyro
[Apr 11-08 16:37:1]Nulvect <fighter> I might allow fire or poisoned arrows but they wouldn't be specific to anyone... and have to redo how arrows work first too
[Apr 11-08 16:37:13]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^ahhh
[Apr 11-08 16:38:5]Nulvect <fighter> of course, ranger campfires would be an easy source of fire
[Apr 11-08 16:38:13]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^ooo, good point!
[Apr 11-08 16:38:25]Yang <fighter> would be sooo cool though, wrap an electric eel's corpse around your spear creating a charge
[Apr 11-08 16:38:43]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^ummm, do we even have electric eels inna game?
[Apr 11-08 16:39:7]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^oooo, I got it
[Apr 11-08 16:39:29]Yang <fighter> yeah the one that para'd me for like an hour
[Apr 11-08 16:39:33]Yang <fighter> hehe citron
[Apr 11-08 16:39:37]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^what about with demon and minotaur corpses, we can harvest the horns?
[Apr 11-08 16:39:49]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^and make super strong arrow heads?
[Apr 11-08 16:40:15]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^I'd be all like 'Demon, gimme yo hornz!'
[Apr 11-08 16:40:27]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^They'd be all like 'Noez!'
[Apr 11-08 16:40:49]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^then I'd take em anyway, make arrows and shoot their brother with em
[Apr 11-08 16:41:31]Yang <fighter> lol make ninja stars out of em and sell um to rogues
[Apr 11-08 16:41:53]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^or horn daggers. >:)
[Apr 11-08 16:42:1]Yang <fighter> oooo that be hott

[Apr 14-08 0:57:1]Nulvect <fighter> hey tai
[Apr 14-08 0:57:41]Tai <fighter> sup Ik
[Apr 14-08 0:57:47]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^Hi Tai. :)
[Apr 14-08 0:57:51]<fighter> Nulvect really ponders changing 'projectile' to 'polearm' and making thrown stuff use ranged...
[Apr 14-08 0:58:27]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^considering my ranged is higher, I'd like that. :) But that's not a good enough reason. :)
[Apr 14-08 0:58:31]Tai <fighter> think that is an way awesome idea
[Apr 14-08 0:59:3]Nulvect <fighter> yeah.. it would put a stop to ridiculous interactions like, oh, say, impaling people with pumpkins...
[Apr 14-08 0:59:17]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^Hey, I shove really hard to get that.
[Apr 14-08 0:59:25]<fighter> Tai grins at Ik
[Apr 14-08 0:59:27]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^I aims for the pooper.
[Apr 14-08 0:59:35]Tai <fighter> i saw we should be able to sharpen pumkins
[Apr 14-08 0:59:41]Tai <fighter> say*
[Apr 14-08 0:59:45]Tai <fighter> hehe
[Apr 14-08 0:59:52]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^not my fault they have big hindquarters
[Apr 14-08 1:0:14]Nulvect <fighter> well, I guess buggering is a form of impaling
[Apr 14-08 1:0:44]<fighter> Tai buggers
[Apr 14-08 1:0:58]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^I prefer to think of it as a rogering.
[Apr 20-08 22:31:2]Nulvect <fighter> I updated shimmer to the new balance system
[Apr 22-08 1:4:46]Qwix <fighter> Nul! change psi storm to brainstorm.. hehe

[May 19-08 3:21:44]Yang <fighter> shield move, unsure of name atm, fighter kneels down with his shield at an angle, opponent runs towards you, you life your enemy throwing him from his feet, or something like that
[May 19-08 3:22:50]Mezmerize <fighter> what kind of fighter would use that?
[May 19-08 3:23:20]Yang <fighter> warriors of course
[May 19-08 3:23:30]Yang <fighter> hehe nah whom ever
[May 19-08 3:23:40]Mezmerize <fighter> I really dont see a warrior using a shield
[May 19-08 3:23:54]Mezmerize <fighter> only class I can see with a shield is a pally
[May 19-08 3:24:6]Yang <fighter> true

[May 21-08 15:28:1]Alexander <fighter> awww =(
[May 21-08 15:28:19]Yang <fighter> but your right, it could be better
[May 21-08 22:18:32]Alexander <fighter> oooo nul, do you intend on anti's getting flog?
[May 21-08 22:21:46]Nulvect <fighter> perhaps
[May 21-08 22:22:0]Alexander <fighter> it'd make sense >=D
[May 21-08 22:22:14]Alexander <fighter> do you have a lot in mind for anti's? or are ideas still welcome?
[May 21-08 22:22:30]Nulvect <fighter> ideas always welcome
[May 21-08 22:22:34]<fighter> Alexander nods
[May 21-08 22:22:58]Alexander <fighter> the main idea is for them to be ruthless, to torture and etc, correct? or at least that's the theme i should base my ideas on?
[May 21-08 22:24:6]Nulvect <fighter> yep
[May 24-08 17:57:36]Yang <fighter> hrmm maybe fighters can inherit a type of massacre

[Jun 8-08 0:42:54]Kilrog <fighter> Nulvect
[Jun 8-08 0:43:16]Kilrog <fighter> Traps are not Party friendly
[Jun 8-08 0:44:38]Nulvect <fighter> so I saw
[Jun 8-08 0:44:42]Nulvect <fighter> I will look into it
[Jun 8-08 0:44:50]<fighter> Kilrog nods
[Jun 8-08 0:53:28]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^hey nul?
[Jun 8-08 0:55:44]Nulvect <fighter> si??
[Jun 8-08 0:56:2]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^should trap hurt party members?
[Jun 8-08 0:56:16]Nulvect <fighter> haven't thought about it yet
[Jun 8-08 0:57:10]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^cuz it does...and i found it to be quite inconvenient. :)
[Jun 8-08 0:57:18]Nulvect <fighter> nod, I saw
[Jun 8-08 0:58:2]Nulvect <fighter> on one hand, being in your party doesn't automatically make someone able to see it, but on the other hand it's not really very fun to accidentally attack a party member.. definitely should not hit if you are with them
[Jun 8-08 0:58:24]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^yeah, I mean, I led him into the room
[Jun 8-08 0:58:34]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^I shoulkd be able to say 'dont step there'
[Jun 8-08 0:59:0]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^can they auto get the disarm option if accompanied by me?
[Jun 8-08 0:59:24]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^I can realize it could keep me from sneaky leading peoples to death, but I wouldnt mind that
[Jun 8-08 0:59:54]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^as it stands, I could booby trap a series of rooms, have someone follow and trap em down to death
[Jun 8-08 1:0:0]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^in the blink of an eye
[Jun 8-08 1:0:4]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^sounds abusable
[Jun 8-08 1:3:4]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm
[Jun 8-08 1:4:4]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^I trapped the whole coliseum
[Jun 8-08 1:4:36]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^if someone were weak enough and following me, I could run em thru each room
[Jun 8-08 1:4:54]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^and they'd get more damage possibly than deathtouch or something
[Jun 8-08 1:5:0]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^not saying my trap is that great
[Jun 8-08 1:5:4]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^just saying
[Jun 8-08 1:5:14]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^someone better's traps could be
[Jun 8-08 1:8:44]Nulvect <fighter> I'll make note of that, no time to fix it until tomorrow or monday though
[Jun 8-08 1:8:50]Iksrtfo <fighter> %^RED%^%^BOLD%^no rush. :)

[Jun 10-08 22:50:1]Nekor <fighter> fo sho
[Jun 14-08 14:51:19]Yang <fighter> wants a move where he digs his weapons into his opponent and lifts them off the ground and tosses them in the air
[Jun 14-08 14:51:29]Yang <fighter> and that was supposed to be an emote
[Jun 14-08 14:52:1]Yang <fighter> also
[Jun 14-08 14:52:57]Yang <fighter> as a warrior i was wondering isince we are masters of all weapons, maybe we can use different kindas of weapons to do moves, like charge, maybe we can use a blunt instea ... you know crazy stuff like that
[Jun 14-08 14:53:19]Yang <fighter> or do whipping motions with a spear... ok that one was pretty crazy
[Jun 14-08 14:56:39]Nulvect <fighter> heh
[Jun 14-08 14:57:29]Nulvect <fighter> you can charge with blunts already
[Jun 14-08 14:57:43]Nulvect <fighter> just not knives, whips, or bows

[Jun 20-08 15:21:37]Cenn <fighter> also one more thats purely aesthetics
[Jun 20-08 15:21:49]Cenn <fighter> but it would be nice for a "Nature" or "Creation" bar under abilities
[Jun 20-08 15:21:57]Cenn <fighter> my other bar goes past the blue +=+=+ thing
[Jun 20-08 15:22:5]Cenn <fighter>  aim, build, bump, butcher, compare, discern, fly, forage, gut, make, sharpen, skin, track
[Jun 20-08 15:22:43]Cenn <fighter> obviously though
[Jun 20-08 15:22:45]Cenn <fighter> not very important at all
[Jun 20-08 15:22:59]Nulvect <fighter> shrug, could probably make it wrap better
[Jun 20-08 15:23:3]Cenn <fighter> nod
[Jun 20-08 15:23:21]Cenn <fighter> i think i can do that with setenv then

[Aug 12-08 17:24:3]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^2
[Aug 12-08 17:24:19]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^still though considering stats it should be that much
[Aug 12-08 17:24:19]Cenn <fighter> at 34 it woul take you 1 :p

[Oct 1-08 22:50:49]Nulvect <fighter> you'd have like 3 lines of attacks
[Oct 1-08 22:51:7]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ya think that would make gash do less dmg?

[Oct 17-08 22:13:32]Terek <fighter> warblade seems to be dex based
[Oct 17-08 22:13:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i doint know too much about zerkers
[Oct 17-08 22:13:52]Terek <fighter> you dont have warblade?

[Oct 17-08 22:14:50]Terek <fighter> am sure they are crazy high allready :p
[Oct 17-08 22:15:0]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nah ive been slacking
[Oct 17-08 22:15:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^went on a trip so no were near my goal
[Oct 17-08 22:16:10]Terek <fighter> i wish Melee was kinda more handy. Id rather use my mlee then a weapon
[Oct 17-08 22:16:56]Terek <fighter> atm, weapons beat melee hands down (no pun intended)
[Oct 17-08 22:18:7]Terek <fighter> pummel and headbutt are awsome, but jab isnt too crash hot
[Oct 17-08 22:30:49]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^see wish brass knuckles werent blunt items
[Oct 17-08 22:31:7]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i mean you should be able to do melee moves with them but i guess not
[Oct 17-08 22:31:9]Terek <fighter> blunt? nah Melee weapons
[Oct 17-08 22:31:41]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^dont brass knuckles count as blunt weapons, ?
[Oct 17-08 22:31:55]Terek <fighter> Brass knuckles is of type melee.
[Oct 17-08 22:32:1]Terek <fighter> discern them
[Oct 17-08 22:32:11]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^awww
[Oct 17-08 22:32:21]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ok i was wrong
[Oct 17-08 22:32:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^thought i heard different
[Oct 17-08 22:32:25]Terek <fighter> ill try them with melee rage
[Oct 17-08 22:32:49]Nulvect <fighter> don't count on them working
[Oct 17-08 22:32:59]Terek <fighter> lol they dont work
[Oct 17-08 22:33:21]Terek <fighter> Nulvect, at some point will jab stop coming up in melee rage?
[Oct 17-08 22:33:59]Terek <fighter> or am i missing somthign where jab gets really good?
[Oct 17-08 22:34:33]Terek <fighter> I think Melee is awsome, id much rather use it then weapons.
[Oct 17-08 22:37:49]Nulvect <fighter> yes, the bigger you get the less you jab
[Oct 17-08 22:37:59]Terek <fighter> phew
[Oct 17-08 22:41:57]Nulvect <fighter> I'm starting to consider making 'melee' an official weapon type
[Oct 17-08 22:42:25]Nulvect <fighter> though it would make more sense to just make it an armour that gives a small skill bonus while worn
[Oct 17-08 22:43:5]Terek <fighter> nods
[Oct 17-08 22:43:53]Terek <fighter> melee is really just making a part of your own body a weapon...
[Oct 17-08 22:44:19]Terek <fighter> cant really remove ya body parts:P
[Oct 17-08 22:45:31]Terek <fighter> i suppose brass knuckles and what not only inhance your natural weapons, so i guess what you said last does make more sence
[Oct 17-08 23:44:40]Terek <fighter> yep melee is good, jab dont help tho lawl
[Oct 17-08 23:51:36]Nulvect <fighter> hmm I didn't realize these things specialed so often
[Oct 17-08 23:53:32]Nulvect <fighter> ok, it's now a set of gloves, it will update next time you log in
[Oct 17-08 23:58:2]Terek <fighter> was that the knuckles?
[Oct 18-08 0:2:36]Nulvect <fighter> yes
[Oct 18-08 1:11:2]Terek <fighter> time to check out ya glove/knuckles
[Oct 18-08 1:14:4]Terek <fighter> least they dont special like bloody strobe lights any more
[Oct 18-08 1:16:10]Terek <fighter> hummm cleave still works with no weapon?
[Oct 18-08 1:17:32]Nulvect <fighter> yep
[Oct 18-08 16:16:2]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ok Nul this might just be the Benadryl, tussionex and Nyquil talking but... what about antis getting a move called sarrate, where the char hits the blade against a hard enough surface where it creates sharp edges sarrating it to a deadly weapon
[Oct 18-08 16:16:34]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^serrate even
[Oct 18-08 16:19:28]Nulvect <fighter> well, that would be more like knicking the blade, but perhaps a spell could do that
[Oct 18-08 16:37:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^awwwwww
[Oct 18-08 16:38:30]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^still like the shard idea.. you hear about that Nul?
[Oct 18-08 16:41:34]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^instead of throwing blades sorcs or maybe antis can break them down with a powerful spell sending shards of metal throught their enemy
[Oct 18-08 16:42:12]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^we thought shred would be a nice name for it
[Oct 19-08 2:47:1]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Yak
[Oct 19-08 2:47:5]Yakko <fighter> sup

[Nov 2-08 1:38:0]Kilrog <fighter> nods
[Nov 2-08 1:38:6]Nulvect <fighter> it's a lot of stuff though, so taking a while
[Nov 2-08 1:38:6]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nice even

[Nov 2-08 2:0:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^all charge is the same no matter your race
[Nov 2-08 2:0:54]Kilrog <fighter> so it was taking longer for other races befor?
[Nov 2-08 2:1:6]Nulvect <fighter> that's not true, it just takes the same amount of time
[Nov 2-08 2:1:6]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^yeah

[Nov 2-08 2:2:4]Kilrog <fighter> nods

[Nov 14-08 22:3:6]Crazylegs <fighter> on some things it can break even sp wise compare to slash but mostly I'd just use it to kill real big stuff

[Nov 14-08 22:4:14]Crazylegs <fighter> damage is like 90% skills

[Nov 21-08 21:59:43]Crazylegs <fighter> yeah
[Nov 21-08 22:0:3]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^dex helps idle so more chances of instaing or 1 rounding 25ks

[Apr 9-09 23:0:6]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^think id play zerker more if i could 19 him again
[Apr 9-09 23:0:18]Scoff <fighter> i had a pally on the old remort system
[Apr 9-09 23:0:24]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^like reset him fully

[Apr 9-09 23:2:8]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ehh he over 19 so... bah
[Apr 9-09 23:5:42]Scoff <fighter> 3 slash = 3 rounds = 1 kill, 1 charge + 2 slashes = 4 rounds = 1 kill
[Apr 9-09 23:5:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^haha
[Apr 9-09 23:6:4]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i know man i know.. hehe
[Apr 9-09 23:6:8]<fighter> Yang ducks
[Apr 9-09 23:6:34]Nulvect <fighter> bleh, I'll take a look at it when I do paladins :P
[Apr 9-09 23:6:42]Scoff <fighter> lol
[Apr 9-09 23:6:44]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey now
[Apr 9-09 23:6:46]Nulvect <fighter> those !@@@@! inits are such a pain
[Apr 9-09 23:7:0]Scoff <fighter> oi nul, i feel like a bastard now hah
[Apr 9-09 23:7:2]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i think its fighter thing?
[Apr 9-09 23:7:16]Scoff <fighter> thats twice this morning you have seen me talking about things that havent been done :p
[Apr 9-09 23:7:32]Nulvect <fighter> well, charge has been done actually
[Apr 9-09 23:7:40]Nulvect <fighter> it's just hard to get ride
[Apr 9-09 23:7:42]Nulvect <fighter> right
[Apr 9-09 23:7:46]Scoff <fighter> ahhh
[Apr 9-09 23:8:0]Scoff <fighter> wouldnt it be like backstab?
[Apr 9-09 23:8:26]Scoff <fighter> like, its really either only going to do two things, hit or miss
[Apr 9-09 23:8:40]Scoff <fighter> getten run down by a horse is going to mess you up prety bad
[Apr 9-09 23:9:14]Nulvect <fighter> heh, true...
[Apr 9-09 23:9:42]Scoff <fighter> the only other thing it could do is if the rider manages to get ya with his/her weapons as well
[Apr 9-09 23:10:46]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kinda seems that rogues/assassins are more of the dmg dealers than fighters :P
[Apr 9-09 23:11:6]Scoff <fighter> i thin they would be if your talking about initators
[Apr 9-09 23:11:20]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nod
[Apr 9-09 23:11:24]Scoff <fighter> a fighter has more bravado then a rogue, hes gonna make him self known
[Apr 9-09 23:11:32]Scoff <fighter> swager in and then hammer you to bits
[Apr 9-09 23:11:46]Scoff <fighter> a fighters power coms from his attacks
[Apr 9-09 23:12:2]Scoff <fighter> a rogues dmg comes from initators, then they shoudl suffer on normal attacks
[Apr 9-09 23:12:26]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hrmm
[Apr 9-09 23:12:32]Nulvect <fighter> and they do
[Apr 9-09 23:12:38]Scoff <fighter> nods
[Apr 9-09 23:12:44]Scoff <fighter> but...charge is charge :p
[Apr 9-09 23:12:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe
[Apr 9-09 23:12:52]Scoff <fighter> thats running some one down :p
[Apr 9-09 23:13:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i wanna be more str based :P
[Apr 9-09 23:13:48]Scoff <fighter> i suppose, if charge dont to massive hp dmg, it could do body dmg?
[Apr 9-09 23:13:58]Scoff <fighter> thatd make sence
[Apr 9-09 23:14:12]Nulvect <fighter> post it up
[Apr 9-09 23:14:12]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^Scoff for Pres!
[Apr 9-09 23:14:20]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^:P

[Apr 9-09 23:16:58]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^now if I was just a raging dragon i think we would be ok
[Apr 9-09 23:17:26]Scoff <fighter> yeah,i wanted a red dragon, but nulevct wont let me :(
[Apr 9-09 23:19:4]Scoff <fighter> chage seems to work better on bigger monsters
[Apr 10-09 15:32:58]Yinn <fighter> ya know what would be fun, if rage raised up not only attack but the weapon skills too
[Apr 10-09 15:33:2]Yinn <fighter> hehe
[Apr 10-09 15:36:4]Yinn <fighter> like if they are over 90 tf
[Apr 10-09 15:36:10]Yinn <fighter> oops haha
[Apr 13-09 21:27:14]Yinn <fighter> randomly i guess
[Apr 13-09 21:56:10]Yinn <fighter> i have been slicing more than mutilating more lately
[Apr 13-09 22:22:54]Yinn <fighter> dunno this stuff lookin fishy
[Apr 14-09 2:14:57]Yinn <fighter> oh nm i dont think ill like the answer
[Apr 14-09 4:9:22]Yinn <fighter> hey Nul can zerkers have rush added to rage?
[Apr 14-09 13:56:44]Yinn <fighter> ehy Nul you see my thing on rush?
[Apr 14-09 13:56:50]Yinn <fighter> err hey*
[Apr 14-09 14:0:54]Nulvect <fighter> delayed abilities in rush are... problematic
[Apr 14-09 14:1:26]Yinn <fighter> oo
[Apr 14-09 14:1:34]Nulvect <fighter> err, in rage
[Apr 14-09 14:1:46]Yinn <fighter> you redid rush? or did D
[Apr 14-09 14:1:54]Nulvect <fighter> I did
[Apr 14-09 14:1:58]Yinn <fighter> cause i remember Rush before..... useless
[Apr 14-09 14:2:10]Yinn <fighter> now it rocks, an actual usable ability
[Apr 14-09 14:2:22]Nulvect <fighter> heh thanks
[Apr 15-09 22:20:29]Yinn <fighter> Hail
[Apr 15-09 22:20:51]Stroyer <fighter> what sub is best?
[Apr 15-09 22:21:5]Yinn <fighter> currently Anti
[Apr 15-09 22:21:11]Yinn <fighter> they gots boost
[Apr 15-09 22:21:17]Yinn <fighter> and they heal i think
[Apr 15-09 22:21:23]Stroyer <fighter> don't their rounds get a lack cause they have spells?
[Apr 15-09 22:21:43]Gar <fighter> My rounds pwn ur face
[Apr 15-09 22:21:49]Gar <fighter> Fear my level 5 buffness
[Apr 15-09 22:21:53]Stroyer <fighter> lols
[Apr 15-09 22:21:57]Yinn <fighter> nah antis pwn
[Apr 15-09 22:22:9]Yinn <fighter> rangers gots loads of stuff
[Apr 15-09 22:22:19]Gar <fighter> Load is the right word
[Apr 15-09 22:22:21]Yinn <fighter> traps, armour ranged...
[Apr 15-09 22:23:43]Yinn <fighter> zerker is ok from what im seeing
[Apr 15-09 22:24:23]Stroyer <fighter> kind of figured zerker would just be melee
[Apr 15-09 22:26:9]Yinn <fighter> zerkers are also axe and blunt too
[Apr 17-09 2:44:12]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hahaha 200 knife and no slice
[Apr 17-09 2:44:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^all these skills... blah

[Apr 17-09 14:45:51]Briar <fighter> hmm
[Apr 18-09 14:34:35]Briar <fighter> nul what kinda things you got planned for aitis?
[Apr 18-09 15:12:33]Nulvect <fighter> hmm, I dunno, I have it all written down somewhere though, briar
[Apr 18-09 15:13:41]Yinn <fighter> i hear they will loose an arm and gain an extra eye
[Apr 18-09 15:14:5]<fighter> Briar stares down mobs.
[Apr 18-09 15:14:11]Yinn <fighter> oo
[Apr 18-09 15:14:23]Yinn <fighter> fighter fear... that'd be nice
[Apr 18-09 15:16:41]Nulvect <fighter> actually, it looks like I don't have that many ideas ready to go for antis
[Apr 18-09 15:16:45]Nulvect <fighter> so.. feel free to post some
[Apr 18-09 15:21:21]Briar <fighter> well just thinking letting us magicaly create a flail.
[Apr 18-09 15:21:41]Briar <fighter> so far i have yet to find a decent flail for fighters in lower levels and ive heard there realy is only one in theh igher levels
[Apr 18-09 15:24:11]Briar <fighter> maybe a dot spell
[Apr 18-09 15:24:25]Briar <fighter> start off with a magic dot spell and come in with slash or flog later
[Apr 18-09 15:28:23]Nulvect <fighter> hmm yeah I guess they could do with another DoT
[Apr 18-09 15:28:41]Briar <fighter> hmm we have one already?
[Apr 18-09 15:30:11]Yinn <fighter> thnik he was talking about classes in general
[Apr 18-09 15:30:33]Nulvect <fighter> was talking for antis
[Apr 18-09 15:32:47]Yinn <fighter> ff oo
[Apr 18-09 15:32:49]Yinn <fighter> err oo
[Apr 18-09 18:4:21]Yinn <fighter> hey Nul it takes 20 sp to rage, i have like 21 sp it says im too tired then i start raging...
[Apr 18-09 18:4:23]Yinn <fighter> kinda wierd huh
[Apr 20-09 14:32:14]Yinn <fighter> ooo a kilrog

[Apr 20-09 14:42:16]Yinn <fighter> nuthin new man
[Apr 20-09 14:42:36]Kilrog <fighter> ?
[Apr 20-09 14:42:36]Yinn <fighter> just gotta wait till Nul does um, think he's got a few ideas already thogh
[Apr 20-09 14:42:44]Yinn <fighter> on warriors i mean
[Apr 20-09 14:43:12]Kilrog <fighter> well, charge really does need an upgarde
[Apr 20-09 14:43:20]Yinn <fighter> yeah
[Apr 20-09 14:43:32]Kilrog <fighter> even if its left the same for other classes and upgraded for warriors
[Apr 20-09 14:44:0]Kilrog <fighter> i can kill the same time with normal abils on same mobs as i can with charge
[Apr 20-09 14:44:18]Kilrog <fighter> quicker sorry*
[Apr 20-09 14:57:26]Yinn <fighter> yeah kinda agree with ya on that one dude
[Apr 20-09 14:58:6]Kilrog <fighter> better to wield 2h weapons in 1h or 2h?
[Apr 20-09 14:59:34]Kilrog <fighter> its not worth the loss of one idle round
[Apr 20-09 15:1:32]Kilrog <fighter> i think ill max axe
[Apr 20-09 15:1:36]Kilrog <fighter> see if axe is any good
[Apr 20-09 15:18:26]Yinn <fighter> from what i know dude
[Apr 20-09 15:18:38]Yinn <fighter> that we dont get anything after warblade
[Apr 20-09 15:18:50]Kilrog <fighter> maxed axe
[Apr 20-09 15:19:6]Kilrog <fighter> have axe, blade, flail and projectile maxrd
[Apr 20-09 15:19:10]Yinn <fighter> nice

[Apr 20-09 15:21:0]Kilrog <fighter> you want a heep of meat/ointment/oils/drinks?
[Apr 21-09 21:0:8]<fighter> Yinn kilrogs
[Apr 21-09 21:0:30]Kilrog <fighter> warrior should be able to wield any weapon in the game
[Apr 21-09 21:0:54]Yinn <fighter> weaponmaster
[Apr 21-09 21:1:8]Nulvect <fighter> I disagree, some special things should be for only certain classes
[Apr 21-09 21:1:20]Yinn <fighter> aaww we must be talking bout giant swords
[Apr 21-09 21:1:26]Kilrog <fighter> sure wsa
[Apr 21-09 21:1:34]Nulvect <fighter> hmm
[Apr 21-09 21:1:54]Nulvect <fighter> I think those are just supposed to be too physically large for non-giants
[Apr 21-09 21:2:0]Kilrog <fighter> nods
[Apr 21-09 21:2:6]Kilrog <fighter> man, i need some new abils :p
[Apr 21-09 21:2:14]<fighter> Kilrog nudges Nulvect
[Apr 21-09 21:2:18]Kilrog <fighter> heh
[Apr 21-09 21:2:22]Yinn <fighter> i see where ya comming from though kilrog, anti too much 2 handed things out there, hopefully Irons place will have a bunch of that stuff
[Apr 21-09 21:2:34]Nulvect <fighter> be sure to vote for warrior when I hold the next vote then
[Apr 21-09 21:2:46]<fighter> Yinn votes with all his alt power
[Apr 21-09 21:3:2]Nulvect <fighter> no alts, 1 vote per player
[Apr 21-09 21:3:6]Kilrog <fighter> id say ill be over it by then
[Apr 21-09 21:3:6]Nulvect <fighter> just like last time
[Apr 21-09 21:3:52]Kilrog <fighter> then hows about you change charge back for us till then?
[Apr 21-09 21:4:20]Nulvect <fighter> uh, as I remember, charge sucked before
[Apr 21-09 21:4:30]Kilrog <fighter> ti still sucks now, it just takes longer to hit
[Apr 21-09 21:4:30]<fighter> Yinn liked the insta :P
[Apr 21-09 21:4:50]Nulvect <fighter> it's not going to be instant
[Apr 21-09 21:5:16]Nulvect <fighter> I'll definitely put it on my list though, probably needs some rethinking
[Apr 21-09 21:5:38]Yinn <fighter> :)
[Apr 21-09 21:16:46]Kilrog <fighter> humm
[Apr 21-09 21:17:12]Kilrog <fighter> how is that warriors get 6 in everything, but dont get 6 in charging/
[Apr 21-09 21:17:38]Nulvect <fighter> do you _really_ need another 6?? you have more than anyone else already
[Apr 21-09 21:17:52]Kilrog <fighter> woah just asking
[Apr 22-09 2:27:55]Briar <fighter> nul your making me want to remort and play a monk :(
[Apr 22-09 2:28:1]Nulvect <fighter> antis are next

[Apr 22-09 21:9:56]Yinn <fighter> train melee
[Apr 22-09 21:10:0]Yinn <fighter> pummel

[Apr 22-09 21:10:32]Yinn <fighter> ehh
[Apr 22-09 21:11:8]Mez <fighter> cant even 2 turn 28k
[Apr 22-09 21:11:54]Yinn <fighter> ferocity maxed? along with melee
[Apr 22-09 21:11:56]Yinn <fighter> ?
[Apr 22-09 21:11:58]Mez <fighter> yep
[Apr 22-09 21:12:8]Yinn <fighter> Nul something is wrong with Mez
[Apr 22-09 21:12:56]Mez <fighter> you really think so?
[Apr 22-09 21:13:36]Yinn <fighter> cause your lvl 34 right>? with decent stats
[Apr 22-09 21:13:44]Yinn <fighter> would think your pummel would rock
[Apr 22-09 21:13:52]Mez <fighter> 36 75str 55dex
[Apr 22-09 21:14:16]Yinn <fighter> hrmm when is fury
[Apr 22-09 21:14:26]Mez <fighter> I couldny tell you its been so long

[Apr 22-09 21:19:48]Nulvect <fighter> how so
[Apr 22-09 21:20:16]Yinn <fighter> he does teeny tiny dmg
[Apr 22-09 21:21:6]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm.. with everything, or just rage, or what??
[Apr 22-09 21:21:6]Yinn <fighter> wow body dmg
[Apr 22-09 21:21:14]Mez <fighter> I dunno
[Apr 22-09 21:21:18]Yinn <fighter> hehe Mez you gotta do a rager
[Apr 22-09 21:21:30]Yinn <fighter> dont think my body can handle much more though
[Apr 22-09 21:22:26]Mez <fighter> hmm
[Apr 22-09 21:23:26]Mez <fighter> So whats the verdict Yinn?
[Apr 22-09 21:23:34]<fighter> Yinn blehs
[Apr 22-09 21:23:46]Yinn <fighter> nah just gotta rage for attacks man
[Apr 22-09 21:24:0]Mez <fighter> rage is dangerous lol
[Apr 22-09 21:24:8]Yinn <fighter> yeah
[Apr 22-09 21:24:24]Yinn <fighter> just gotta up the dex and con, dex for defense and idle hits and con for... well you know
[Apr 22-09 21:24:48]Mez <fighter> I thought my pummel was weak?
[Apr 22-09 21:25:8]Yinn <fighter> yeah kinda,..
[Apr 22-09 21:25:18]Yinn <fighter> i guess its for rage only
[Apr 22-09 21:25:24]Yinn <fighter> hehe
[Apr 22-09 21:25:34]Mez <fighter> then it throws in that panzy jab :( lol
[Apr 22-09 21:26:2]Mez <fighter> if hew would double hit the first hit it would be much better
[Apr 22-09 21:41:43]Mez <fighter> Can you use brass knuckles with pummel?
[Apr 22-09 21:43:59]Yinn <fighter> im not sure dude
[Apr 22-09 21:44:7]Yinn <fighter> it would make sense
[Apr 22-09 21:44:15]Mez <fighter> if only i killed stuff in 1 hit with rage :P
[Apr 22-09 21:45:9]Mez <fighter> where do the brass knuckles come from?
[Apr 22-09 21:45:21]Yinn <fighter> it was moved a few months back
[Apr 22-09 21:45:25]Yinn <fighter> not sure where it is now
[Apr 22-09 21:46:13]Yinn <fighter> nod
[Apr 22-09 21:46:47]Yinn <fighter> not there anymore
[Apr 22-09 23:33:3]Mez <fighter> Did you redo Zerkers Nul?
[Apr 22-09 23:48:33]Nulvect <fighter> yes, long time back
[Apr 22-09 23:49:25]Mez <fighter> Ok, I only saw one post stating that you were going to give them a few axe abils and some blunt abils? Did you stay true to that :P
[Apr 22-09 23:50:31]Nulvect <fighter> uh.. I think so??
[Apr 22-09 23:50:53]Mez <fighter> lol, just wanted to see before i wasted the xp to raise blunt
[Apr 22-09 23:51:31]Nulvect <fighter> not so much on the blunt really
[Apr 22-09 23:52:1]Mez <fighter> Is there anyway to stop rage from spamming jab when you arent wielding anything?
[Apr 22-09 23:52:15]Nulvect <fighter> sure
[Apr 22-09 23:52:37]Mez <fighter> How so?
[Apr 25-09 18:2:17]Briar <fighter> hmm whats perception and ferocity for.
[Apr 26-09 2:7:37]Nulvect <fighter> attention
[Apr 26-09 2:7:45]Yinn <fighter> sup

[May 15-09 20:16:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul got ideas for ya
[May 15-09 20:30:27]<fighter> Yang wants to shoot flaming pumpkins
[May 16-09 5:35:21]Krowe <fighter> hrmm kinda think Rejik should sell arrows/quivers, cause if you dont have buff friends, you have to wait till your buff to use shoot
[May 16-09 13:45:58]Yang <fighter> hey Nul, whatcha think of my ideas?
[May 16-09 13:47:2]Nulvect <fighter> well... I think rend could be one of the combined weapons moves... but shooting anything besides arrows doesn't really make sense
[May 16-09 13:47:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kool, whatcha think about the steadfast thing
[May 16-09 13:48:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kinda like rolling with the punches idea
[May 16-09 13:49:24]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^if you know its comming , prepare for it and move with the attack you' recieve less dmg
[May 16-09 13:50:2]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm
[May 16-09 13:50:46]Nulvect <fighter> I dunno, that's sort of what the perception skill itself is for
[May 16-09 13:51:16]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^aww ok
[May 16-09 13:51:26]Nulvect <fighter> I'll keep it in mind though
[May 16-09 13:52:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kool
[May 25-09 5:13:30]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^wow somethings gotta be wrong, in elven town and my idles barely kill these guys
[May 25-09 5:19:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^wow moonblade is better than ancient axe?
[May 25-09 5:21:10]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sumthin aint right
[May 26-09 15:16:24]Yinn <fighter> need more stats... need more stats... need more stats!!!
[May 26-09 15:17:22]Yinn <fighter> wow that probably should have been on fighter line... sorry
[May 26-09 15:17:34]Nulvect <fighter> no prob
[May 26-09 15:17:38]Nulvect <fighter> that is odd
[May 26-09 15:17:52]Nulvect <fighter> where's ancient axe from??
[May 26-09 15:18:4]Yinn <fighter> Hamen's tomb
[May 26-09 15:19:18]Nulvect <fighter> ancient hatchet you mean??
[May 26-09 15:19:32]Yinn <fighter> lol thats the one
[May 26-09 15:19:38]Yinn <fighter> you know me and words and spelling and stuff
[May 26-09 15:20:52]Nulvect <fighter> hmm, all looks ok to me
[May 26-09 15:21:56]Yinn <fighter> k ill have Yang go check again,
[May 26-09 15:22:6]Yinn <fighter> must have done something wrong
[May 26-09 15:26:36]Yinn <fighter> thnx for checking on that btw
[May 26-09 15:27:24]Nulvect <fighter> no problem
[May 26-09 15:27:44]Nulvect <fighter> moonblade may be a little strong, but it is one of a kind
[May 26-09 15:28:14]Yinn <fighter> tru
[May 26-09 15:28:38]Yinn <fighter> ever read Elf Quest?
[May 26-09 15:28:50]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm, nope
[May 26-09 15:35:6]Yinn <fighter> i think in Elf Quest, the main char had a sword called the moonblade that had a key at the end of it, in its hilt,  pretty kool comic, used to ride wolves and sprites used to try and coccoon them while they slept
[May 26-09 15:38:46]Nulvect <fighter> that sounds cool
[May 27-09 20:37:53]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^wow moonblade is better than golden pike
[May 27-09 20:38:25]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^lol my shoot isnt any good

[Jun 17-09 22:59:57]Yinn <fighter> we need more lvl 19 axes
[Jun 17-09 23:0:5]Yinn <fighter> good lvl 19 axes ... :)
[Jun 17-09 23:0:15]<fighter> Yinn codes
[Jun 21-09 6:54:47]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^wow citizens are pretty tough, takes a charge to actually sever anything
[Jun 22-09 2:41:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul
[Jun 22-09 2:41:47]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^was thinking bout a think to do with throw
[Jun 22-09 2:44:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^just being able to throw both weapons or even shields at your opponents and ripping them out of their flesh causing extreme bleeding
[Jun 22-09 14:42:38]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^
[Jun 22-09 14:42:42]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^err
[Jun 22-09 14:43:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul lemme know whatcha thing about my idea, its kinda a coupe thing, that whole last resort move
[Jun 22-09 14:43:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^might be a bit off, i have other directions that i could go with it if you want
[Jun 22-09 16:25:48]Nulvect <fighter> the idea looked plausible, yang
[Jun 22-09 16:26:8]Nulvect <fighter> I dunno about automatically retrieving your weapons though
[Jun 22-09 16:26:40]Nulvect <fighter> they'd certainly be on the corpse at least
[Jun 22-09 16:29:42]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^was thinkin botu that, maybe a 2 step thing? like the whirl throw but after that  would be retrieve weapon for the second part :)
[Jun 22-09 16:30:18]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^thnx for the feedback Nul lemme know what other directions you were thinking of with warriors
[Jun 22-09 16:30:38]Nulvect <fighter> perhaps you spin and throw your weapons at them, then immediately rush and knock them down and retrieve all or some of the weapons
[Jun 22-09 16:30:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^holy beep
[Jun 22-09 16:30:56]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i like that idea better
[Jun 22-09 16:31:8]Nulvect <fighter> hehe
[Jun 22-09 16:31:18]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^great combo idea
[Jun 22-09 16:33:30]Nulvect <fighter> so there's that for a finisher move, perhaps a low level move to let you do two of the [weapon] abilities at once (at less than full power of course)...
[Jun 22-09 16:34:6]Nulvect <fighter> and the big combo move where you get new attacks out of it, which will engulf the gash and entangle abilities...
[Jun 22-09 16:34:52]Nulvect <fighter> still need some defense stuff, probably some kind of two-weapon block/parry thing..
[Jun 22-09 16:35:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i was thinking about a weapons trap, but i dont want it to sound like disarm
[Jun 22-09 16:35:52]Nulvect <fighter> nod
[Jun 22-09 16:35:58]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^using like a sword and an axe to trap a weapon while headbutting or somthin
[Jun 22-09 16:37:22]Nulvect <fighter> well, it could perhaps make them drop the weapon
[Jun 22-09 16:37:34]Nulvect <fighter> disarm actually makes it fly off into another room
[Jun 22-09 16:37:46]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i guess trappin them with the two then spinning ripping them out of their hands ?
[Jun 22-09 16:38:4]Nulvect <fighter> probably would be a reaction move
[Jun 22-09 16:38:8]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^aww
[Jun 22-09 16:38:22]Nulvect <fighter> if someone slashes you it would activate
[Jun 22-09 16:38:56]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hrmm sidestepping is to swashie
[Jun 22-09 16:38:58]Nulvect <fighter> might be able to go offensive though, I'll have to think about it
[Jun 22-09 16:39:2]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^man what to do what to do
[Jun 22-09 16:39:12]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kool
[Jun 22-09 16:39:16]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^thnx for the brainstorm
[Jun 22-09 16:39:34]Nulvect <fighter> heh no prob
[Jun 22-09 16:40:0]Nulvect <fighter> just make sure all your stuff is on warrior board, I pour over the board for a subclass before I start on them
[Jun 22-09 16:41:10]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^aww koo
[Jun 24-09 21:48:23]Briar <fighter> sup nul.
[Jun 24-09 22:15:1]Nulvect <fighter> hey
[Jun 29-09 23:34:25]Yang <fighter> oh btw Nul when i posted about strangle i meant with a whip or a chain of a flail or something to that effect

[Jul 2-09 1:4:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul what do you think about strangle with whip may be more of a anti move though
[Jul 2-09 1:6:46]Nulvect <fighter> hmm
[Jul 2-09 1:7:16]Nulvect <fighter> not a bad idea in general, post it up, I may at least use it as part of a combo move
[Jul 2-09 1:8:26]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ was thinking bout using blunt and whip together, like you hit someone in the knee bringing them down then wrap your whip/chain around their neck squeeze till you hear a snap or they knock out, you can alter it how ever you want though, just an idea while tripping and almost swallowing my gum
[Jul 2-09 1:9:6]Nulvect <fighter> hehe
[Jul 3-09 1:1:34]Busan <fighter> sup
[Jul 4-09 15:8:3]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sup Darwyn
[Jul 4-09 18:10:55]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul, you've seen Roses' Ultra move? kinda thought of an anti move, but instead the charge be more demonic and come from the antis body
[Jul 4-09 19:52:49]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm, perhaps
[Jul 4-09 22:32:44]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^man must need more charging to kill off a 50ker
[Jul 5-09 3:24:50]Darwyn <fighter> What'd you go do to yourself yang?
[Jul 5-09 3:25:18]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^had PRK done, kinda like Lasix but recovery time is more harsh
[Jul 5-09 3:25:40]Darwyn <fighter> ahh, well it will all be worth it when you recover :)
[Jul 5-09 3:25:50]Darwyn <fighter> if I had the money to do it I would :/
[Jul 5-09 3:26:4]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^yeah the first like 3 days i was all nauseaded and it hurt dude
[Jul 5-09 3:26:16]Darwyn <fighter> Do not doubt
[Jul 5-09 3:26:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^good painkillers though
[Jul 5-09 3:27:18]<fighter> Darwyn chuckles.
[Jul 7-09 2:23:55]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^pugatory guard unwields and drops all but i only get his armour? ... weak...
[Jul 7-09 3:21:49]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> test

[Jul 7-09 22:22:10]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ and dex that is
[Jul 10-09 3:32:36]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^
[Jul 20-09 21:7:41]Nulvect <fighter> yang, I could use some mostly physical ability ideas for antis
[Jul 20-09 21:7:49]Nulvect <fighter> and a good idea of what shimmer should do
[Jul 20-09 21:7:57]Nulvect <fighter> or if it should just be replaced
[Jul 20-09 21:11:35]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sorry Nul, i never liked shimmer
[Jul 20-09 21:12:9]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^what about adding demonfire to their weapon instead
[Jul 20-09 21:12:25]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^wait not demonfire
[Jul 20-09 21:12:37]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^what is that low lvl anti spell
[Jul 20-09 21:14:7]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^and are anti's going to be more spear/projectile?
[Jul 20-09 21:17:51]Nulvect <fighter> no, they have that for charging style attacks
[Jul 20-09 21:17:55]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^err i mean more flail projectile
[Jul 20-09 21:18:17]Nulvect <fighter> will be something else to support flail
[Jul 20-09 21:18:23]Nulvect <fighter> spears are generally decent already
[Jul 20-09 21:18:33]Nulvect <fighter> low level anti spell... shadowburst??
[Jul 20-09 21:18:39]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^aww thats the one
[Jul 20-09 21:18:49]Nulvect <fighter> nah I have a better thing like that planned
[Jul 20-09 21:18:53]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oooo
[Jul 20-09 21:20:33]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i know this sounds like entangle but what about entangling someone with their whip and slamming them againts a wall or somethign
[Jul 20-09 21:21:17]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^maybe the slam can daze them
[Jul 20-09 21:25:57]Nulvect <fighter> sounds like the special on the whip command
[Jul 20-09 21:26:9]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ooo
[Jul 20-09 21:47:43]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oh shoots,
[Jul 20-09 21:48:1]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^Bah
[Jul 20-09 21:48:13]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^forgot to write up the one i was tellin you about Nul
[Jul 20-09 21:49:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^the move i got from Rose from Streetfighter 4
[Jul 20-09 21:50:37]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^where you wrap your whip around any part of your opponent and send a demonic charge from your soul/body through the whip to your enemy shocking/causing them intense pain and suffering
[Jul 20-09 21:51:19]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^maybe a special can be where if you wrap it around their head it can temporarily confuse or blind them
[Jul 21-09 22:36:20]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ hey Nul what do you think about being able to do stun and start rush in the same round?
[Jul 21-09 22:58:52]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ and what about being able to wrap your whip around your enemy's weapon and yanking it out of thier hands
[Jul 22-09 1:36:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nulvect

[Aug 11-09 0:47:6]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i keep thinking bout finishers for antis, like this other one, where you get the guy on the ground face in the dirt, wielding 2 whips each of them is holding an arm, while pulling back and stepping on their back, neck or head till you feel a snap
[Aug 12-09 23:25:41]Cet <fighter> rage sucks :(

[Aug 17-09 4:18:34]Nulvect <fighter> you obviously won't be using 'warblade' with a whip, but maybe some high level generic all-weapon-type abil

[Aug 29-09 19:18:11]Stormbringer <fighter> grumble grumble
[Sep 4-09 0:18:15]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^was thinking, as a warrior and master of weaponry, could we be able to sharpen other peoples bladeded weapons while they are still wielding them?
[Sep 4-09 0:18:35]Stormbringer <fighter> only if you will sacrifice a limb.
[Sep 4-09 0:18:47]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey now
[Sep 4-09 0:19:49]Stormbringer <fighter> heh be happy we don't have you buy sharpening stones to use it :p
[Sep 4-09 0:19:57]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^doh
[Sep 4-09 0:20:5]<fighter> Yang leaves sharpen alone from now on
[Sep 4-09 0:20:11]Stormbringer <fighter> I would think
[Sep 4-09 0:20:39]Stormbringer <fighter> that you would need to hold the weapon just because you need to move the blade in certain wasys to sharpen it
[Sep 4-09 0:21:3]<fighter> Yang shuts the spank up from now on
[Sep 4-09 0:21:21]Stormbringer <fighter> nah, tis all good dude :)
[Sep 4-09 0:22:11]Stormbringer <fighter> I like your thinkin, just thinking sharpening in real life is a skill, it takes some serious practice to get good with a wetstone
[Sep 4-09 0:22:41]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^dats tru man
[Sep 4-09 0:23:13]Stormbringer <fighter> to not mess up an edge takes some doing, I have a couple of pocketknives I can show you as proof ;)

[Oct 16-09 17:24:49]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ then since the whip is the antis special weapon, summon the soul within to craft a whip/flail
[Oct 16-09 17:41:31]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ hrmm reading last fighter... i take it all back
[Oct 16-09 17:56:1]Stormbringer <fighter> take it all back?
[Oct 16-09 18:11:15]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ yeah it sounds retarded
[Oct 16-09 18:11:21]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ ill figure something else out
[Oct 16-09 18:13:15]Stormbringer <fighter> rage
[Oct 16-09 18:13:37]Stormbringer <fighter> heh
[Oct 16-09 18:14:27]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ hehe mines is better :P
[Oct 16-09 18:14:45]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ talkin to SB on fighter line
[Oct 16-09 18:14:49]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ BAH
[Oct 16-09 18:20:11]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ so since bleed is a low lvl spell could we just add on or some how corrupt the weapon for a single strike with either an up and down motion or a slash
[Oct 16-09 18:21:25]Stormbringer <fighter> hrm
[Oct 16-09 18:22:11]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ too lame?
[Oct 16-09 18:22:13]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ lol
[Oct 16-09 18:22:22]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ i know right its not unique enough
[Oct 16-09 18:28:58]Stormbringer <fighter> nah, it might be
[Oct 16-09 18:29:36]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ i know how Nul likes making everything unique
[Oct 16-09 18:47:52]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ k i think i have one more
[Oct 16-09 18:48:10]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ an "evil intent" aura
[Oct 16-09 18:48:32]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ antis will have slash, whip and impale
[Oct 16-09 18:48:58]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ but after casting evil intent specials will be added on to those moves
[Oct 16-09 18:49:56]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ like after whipping someone( with the aura on) you will also jerk your whip tearing your enemies flesh
[Oct 16-09 18:50:38]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ and after impaling you push the spear deeper or swing the spear out of your enemie or just jab them again with it
[Oct 16-09 18:51:8]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ with slash id like to see not only the antis cut or stab with their sword but also twist it out of their opponent
[Oct 16-09 18:51:28]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ something along the tortureous lines

[Dec 24-09 22:25:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^each guild has different types of eq their own oil/ointment items, and some have their own seals/waxes

[Dec 24-09 22:26:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^most guilds have certain requirements, #1  to be active, and they differ from there
[Dec 24-09 22:27:28]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^dont think PD is willing to open a new guild or clan at this moment seeing how we are lacking a bit on new players
[Dec 24-09 22:29:26]Link <fighter> I see. Personally its just a quirk that i used to have on the other MUD i use to play. I started a clan that became popular but it was supposed to be just a joke. Ahhh.....the good ol Banana Clan

[Apr 21-10 14:55:32]Nulvect <fighter> focus attack... depends
[Apr 21-10 14:55:42]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^thats all those
[Apr 21-10 14:55:48]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^used
[Apr 21-10 14:55:56]Nulvect <fighter> yeah it's important
[Apr 21-10 14:56:6]Nulvect <fighter> sakura has an especially good focus attack too
[Apr 21-10 14:56:8]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^with Sagat it was stun 2 low kicks then fireball
[Apr 21-10 14:56:20]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^yeah luv that knee
[Apr 21-10 14:56:36]Nulvect <fighter> vega's is also awesome
[Apr 21-10 14:56:44]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^havent really messed with him
[Apr 21-10 14:56:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^he is all about quickness and single attacks
[Apr 21-10 14:57:0]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^not really my cup of tea
[Apr 21-10 14:57:16]Nulvect <fighter> it's fun baiting people though
[Apr 21-10 14:57:30]Perel <fighter> so this is the first char I haven't been able to fly on.... in along time
[Apr 21-10 14:57:36]Perel <fighter> its like agh
[Apr 21-10 14:57:40]Nulvect <fighter> I walk right up to them and do a backflip when they try to hit me
[Apr 21-10 14:57:48]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^what about slow fireballs?
[Apr 21-10 14:58:4]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^yours Perel
[Apr 21-10 14:58:6]Perel <fighter> <3
[Apr 21-10 14:58:14]Nulvect <fighter> well, same way anyone deals with slow fireballs
[Apr 21-10 14:58:26]Nulvect <fighter> absorb with a focus attack, neutral jump, or just block
[Apr 21-10 14:58:30]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^jump jump jump
[Apr 21-10 14:58:42]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^what about that rolling attack
[Apr 21-10 14:58:46]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^does that go through?
[Apr 21-10 14:58:56]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i need to find out how to cancel taht focus attack
[Apr 21-10 14:58:56]Nulvect <fighter> ex version does, but it sucks sooooo bad
[Apr 21-10 14:59:2]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ooo
[Apr 21-10 14:59:22]Nulvect <fighter> light rolling attack is the only one to really use
[Apr 21-10 14:59:30]Nulvect <fighter> you can dash out of a focus attack
[Apr 21-10 14:59:36]Nulvect <fighter> forward or back
[Apr 21-10 14:59:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^awww ok
[Apr 21-10 14:59:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^trynna watch those guys play made me dizzy
[Apr 21-10 15:0:14]Nulvect <fighter> sakura's hurricane kick can probably go over fireballs, I think ex sho'ouken goes through them too
[Apr 21-10 15:1:22]Nulvect <fighter> dunno how ibuki will handle them... I guess her jump off your head move might work
[Apr 21-10 15:2:50]Nulvect <fighter> l
[Apr 21-10 15:2:54]Nulvect <fighter> woops
[Apr 21-10 15:10:38]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^didnt ibuki have a slide under?
[Apr 21-10 15:11:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^the neck breaker
[Apr 21-10 15:12:26]Nulvect <fighter> oh yeah
[Apr 21-10 15:12:36]Nulvect <fighter> ex version goes through fireballs, not sure of normal
[Apr 21-10 15:37:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ouch drow whirls hurt

[Apr 26-10 0:11:46]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^Nul
[Apr 26-10 0:12:26]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ya gotta code Vyce
[Apr 26-10 0:12:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe
[Apr 26-10 0:12:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^put him in the arena
[Apr 26-10 0:29:28]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^mmmm repop
[Apr 26-10 2:57:54]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul post 65 2nd idea =P
[Apr 26-10 2:58:56]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe just food for thought on antis
[Apr 26-10 2:59:18]Nulvect <fighter> sort of an.. electrocute them with evil.. type move
[Apr 26-10 2:59:42]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^yeah
[Apr 26-10 2:59:46]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^just a thought tho
[Apr 26-10 3:0:14]Nulvect <fighter> I was going to make something that causes more bleeding, but maybe the two ideas could mesh
[Apr 26-10 3:0:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^the fact that the whip is more of a torture weapon not wanting to really kill then to incorporate a curse
[Apr 26-10 3:0:56]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe that could make you bleed more that drains hp
[Apr 26-10 3:0:58]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^jk
[Apr 26-10 3:1:20]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sounds more like an init or could it be a coupe
[Apr 26-10 3:1:36]Nulvect <fighter> they already have their finishing move
[Apr 26-10 3:1:38]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^draining the anti of all his mp
[Apr 26-10 3:1:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ooo nice
[Apr 26-10 3:1:56]Nulvect <fighter> well, it's not strictly finishing
[Apr 26-10 3:2:6]<fighter> Yang smacks Mrityudand for not telling him
[Apr 26-10 3:2:8]Nulvect <fighter> but it will probably do the trick
[Apr 26-10 3:2:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^Mr It you got that stuff yet?
[Apr 26-10 3:3:12]Nulvect <fighter> I made note of your idea yang, I may just use it as a hybrid idea, I wasn't really fond of the thing I had in that slot before anyway
[Apr 26-10 3:3:28]Mrityudand <fighter> i havent seen no finishing move yet :S
[Apr 26-10 3:3:44]Mrityudand <fighter> my skills suck lol
[Apr 26-10 3:3:54]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oo thnx for keepin that move in mind Nul
[Apr 26-10 3:3:56]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oo
[Apr 26-10 3:4:16]Nulvect <fighter> finishing moves are like level 40-50 and 40 would be very low...
[Apr 26-10 3:4:26]Nulvect <fighter> I think each fighter will get their own
[Apr 26-10 3:4:38]Nulvect <fighter> may have to edit anti's, we'll see
[Apr 26-10 3:4:42]Mrityudand <fighter> Oo coupedegrace is back
[Apr 26-10 3:4:46]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oo nice
[Apr 26-10 3:5:0]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^swashie thing now
[Apr 26-10 3:5:6]Mrityudand <fighter> nod
[Apr 26-10 3:5:26]Nulvect <fighter> and you'll notice I promised in my finger info to do one abil for warriors before the vote
[Apr 26-10 3:5:36]Nulvect <fighter> cause I feel bad that they haven't gotten anything
[Apr 26-10 3:5:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^WOOT
[Apr 26-10 3:5:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i saw i saw
[Apr 26-10 3:5:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe thnx Nul
[Apr 26-10 3:6:2]Nulvect <fighter> I'll probably take out entangle and gash when I do it but it'll be worth it, don't worry
[Apr 26-10 3:6:4]Mrityudand <fighter> so anti close to done?
[Apr 26-10 3:6:14]Nulvect <fighter> yep, read updatenews
[Apr 26-10 3:6:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ya still thinking combos on warriors Nul?
[Apr 26-10 3:6:52]Nulvect <fighter> the weapon special thing started out as being for an anti spell, then I found out things were broken
[Apr 26-10 3:7:4]Nulvect <fighter> combination attacks with multiple weapons, yeah
[Apr 26-10 3:7:18]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oooo sweeeeeet
[Apr 26-10 3:7:44]Nulvect <fighter> it may yet be a while... I'm completely overhauling sorcerors
[Apr 26-10 3:7:54]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nod
[Apr 26-10 3:7:54]Nulvect <fighter> but just wanted you to know I hadn't forgotten

[Apr 30-10 18:9:45]Nulvect <fighter> apparently ferocity for antis was left out during the last skill update and nobody told me
[Apr 30-10 18:9:55]Nulvect <fighter> err, for berserkers
[Apr 30-10 18:9:57]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ oo
[Apr 30-10 18:10:3]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ lol
[Apr 30-10 18:10:19]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ i didnt notice either till now
[Apr 30-10 18:10:19]Nulvect <fighter> sorry about that, but at least it's cheap
[Apr 30-10 18:10:27]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ no worries all maxed now

[Apr 30-10 18:36:59]Nulvect <fighter> still got a few things to do though
[Apr 30-10 18:37:31]Mrityudand <fighter> looking forward to it :D
[Apr 30-10 19:5:18]<fighter> Yang needs a stun :P
[May 4-10 23:42:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^say what?
[May 9-10 19:24:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^just hope warriors keep warblade after the change
[May 9-10 19:24:58]Nulvect <fighter> yep
[May 9-10 19:25:2]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe sweet
[May 9-10 19:25:2]Nulvect <fighter> warblade is for all fighters
[May 9-10 19:25:8]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oo btw
[May 9-10 19:25:12]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i hate vega :P
[May 9-10 19:25:20]Nulvect <fighter> vega > you
[May 9-10 19:25:20]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^he worked me soo bad yesterday
[May 9-10 19:25:26]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^haha
[May 9-10 19:25:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^does that claw really add dmg? or just reach?
[May 9-10 19:26:2]Nulvect <fighter> losing the claw makes him do 10-15 less damage for every hit that uses the claw
[May 9-10 19:26:6]Nulvect <fighter> including both ultras
[May 9-10 19:26:8]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^awww
[May 9-10 19:26:28]Nulvect <fighter> the reach part is more important though
[May 9-10 19:26:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^well he did that claw ultra that hits you up in the air and slashes right when i hit my Ultra on Sakura
[May 9-10 19:26:56]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^that guy is MAJOR offence
[May 9-10 19:27:6]Nulvect <fighter> hehe nice timing for him
[May 9-10 19:27:12]Nulvect <fighter> hmm kind of a mix
[May 9-10 19:27:24]Nulvect <fighter> if you go all out aggro you can die pretty fast
[May 9-10 19:27:34]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^yeah that was my prob
[May 9-10 19:27:56]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^then after 2 fights i brought in Ryu
[May 9-10 19:28:2]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^then it was all good
[May 9-10 19:28:20]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^is cheezy like that
[May 9-10 19:28:28]Nulvect <fighter> ryu's not that bad for vega
[May 9-10 19:28:42]Nulvect <fighter> unless the vega is jumpy
[May 9-10 19:28:54]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^and OMG wth did Streetfighter do to Chun Li???
[May 9-10 19:29:0]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^she is soooooooo slow
[May 9-10 19:29:18]Nulvect <fighter> chun is seriously one of the best chars in ssf4
[May 9-10 19:29:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^her air jumps take forever for her to land
[May 9-10 19:29:28]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^the timing is harder
[May 9-10 19:29:32]Nulvect <fighter> yeah her jump is floaty
[May 9-10 19:29:34]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^for what im used with her
[May 9-10 19:30:4]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i used to use her like people use vega
[May 9-10 19:30:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^with the upward kick and her firball and her spinning bird kick when close
[May 9-10 19:30:24]Nulvect <fighter> with chun it's all about the footsies and comboing into ex-legs
[May 9-10 19:30:34]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nod
[May 9-10 19:30:38]Nulvect <fighter> sbk kind of sucks
[May 9-10 19:31:6]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^well the special sbk helps when you have someone rushing in for combos
[May 9-10 19:31:16]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kinda pushes them back
[May 9-10 19:31:28]Nulvect <fighter> yeah ex-sbk is a good reversal
[May 9-10 19:31:44]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^just always thought of Chun to be a jumper
[May 9-10 19:31:56]Nulvect <fighter> oh, she can do good jumping attacks
[May 9-10 19:31:58]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^with alot of sweep/ground kicks
[May 9-10 19:32:2]Nulvect <fighter> just have to time it right
[May 9-10 19:32:30]Nulvect <fighter> her jumping... fierce I think, the two-hitter.. land, jump and do three toe taps :P
[May 9-10 19:32:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^aight man ill bbl gonna look for a car today
[May 9-10 19:32:56]Nulvect <fighter> car?? you can't just walk across the island in an hour?? :P
[May 12-10 14:42:26]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ dang i should lvl
[May 12-10 20:56:49]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ hey Nul so what was with weapons btw?
[May 12-10 20:57:9]Nulvect <fighter> kind of hard to explain
[May 12-10 20:57:51]Nulvect <fighter> someone set it up weapon specials really wonky a long time ago and everyone has copied them since
[May 12-10 21:4:3]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ aww lol
[May 12-10 21:4:13]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ so you had to basically re-write it?
[May 12-10 21:4:21]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ or just change a few things?
[May 12-10 21:4:35]Nulvect <fighter> just changed a few things
[May 12-10 21:4:41]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ kool
[May 12-10 22:52:23]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ dang need more dex
[May 12-10 22:52:29]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ so weak
[May 14-10 1:24:48]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ hey Nul
[May 14-10 1:26:26]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ when you get back did i ever ask you about warriors possibly being able to wield any raced/subclassed based weapon, as long as its within lvl reason
[May 14-10 1:26:58]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ but they still wont AL tho
[May 14-10 1:27:38]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ haha ill post it this time so i wont forget
[May 14-10 17:28:50]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^

[May 15-10 17:43:21]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^
[May 16-10 0:19:52]Scoff <fighter> am haven a crack at paladin. Its been a long time!
[May 17-10 2:18:55]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^NUL
[May 17-10 2:19:5]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^Scoff gots some awesome ideas for pallies
[May 17-10 2:19:17]Scoff <fighter> nulvect
[May 17-10 2:20:7]Scoff <fighter> an abil for pallys, if they are going to be relying on charge- how about  a charge with a chance to parra the player/monster, called righteous charge
[May 17-10 2:20:53]Scoff <fighter> requires a pally mount, possably they could get an abil to summon their own mount
[May 17-10 2:21:3]Scoff <fighter> just like Cyan said
[May 17-10 2:21:9]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^summon moun would be cool
[May 17-10 2:21:31]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ooo a pegasus
[May 17-10 2:21:53]Scoff <fighter> "etheral charger":
[May 17-10 2:22:25]Scoff <fighter> "holy roller" ! lol
[May 17-10 2:22:31]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^LOL
[May 17-10 2:23:17]Scoff <fighter> oi
[May 17-10 2:23:35]Scoff <fighter> an abil for a pally with a summond mount, charging with a "prijectile" weapon
[May 17-10 2:24:13]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^with shields yelling out THIS IS SPARTA!
[May 17-10 2:24:17]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe jk
[May 17-10 2:24:21]Scoff <fighter> if the charge hits right, the "projectile" weapon skaewers the monster/player to the ground
[May 17-10 2:24:35]Scoff <fighter> allowing for a second chance to charge them again
[May 17-10 2:25:57]Scoff <fighter> rofl
[May 17-10 2:26:23]Scoff <fighter> i might just copy past the fighter chat into a post ffor pally board
[May 17-10 2:26:39]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kool that'll do
[May 17-10 2:27:11]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oh and dont forget to put in Yangs Haudoken then ... dont want him to forget

[Jul 12-10 23:2:20]Penance <fighter> and rage is compltely out of the question against 30k+ mobs

[Jul 12-10 23:2:44]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ nod

[Jul 18-10 22:24:18]<fighter> Terek grumbles about jab
[Jul 18-10 22:25:46]Terek <fighter> is there a achance that at a higher level i wont jab in melee rage?
[Jul 18-10 23:3:2]Nulvect <fighter> you like complaining, you can be my guinea pig
[Jul 18-10 23:3:14]Terek <fighter> i do?
[Jul 18-10 23:3:22]Nulvect <fighter> trying something new on the cleave special
[Jul 18-10 23:3:24]Terek <fighter> it was more of a question lol bt sure
[Jul 18-10 23:3:42]Terek <fighter> ok one sec
[Jul 18-10 23:4:20]Terek <fighter> i might have to go melee
[Jul 18-10 23:5:14]Terek <fighter> seems the same to me
[Jul 18-10 23:6:48]Terek <fighter> keep going?
[Jul 18-10 23:8:18]Terek <fighter> pummel is freaken awsome
[Jul 18-10 23:8:44]Nulvect <fighter> from my own test the cleave should be much better now
[Jul 18-10 23:8:50]Terek <fighter> roge
[Jul 18-10 23:9:22]Terek <fighter> rage on!
[Jul 18-10 23:14:36]Nulvect <fighter> also adjusted the chances of using low-level vs high-level abilities
[Jul 18-10 23:14:42]Nulvect <fighter> so jab should be less often
[Jul 18-10 23:15:20]Terek <fighter> thanks heeps for that man. am not sure what its like at elite, but at this level when you have other abils to pump out... getten several "jabs" in a row can kill you in rage
[Jul 18-10 23:16:0]Terek <fighter> and i LOVE seeing pummel go off. that abil is wicked as
[Jul 18-10 23:16:52]Terek <fighter> am going to check it out now
[Jul 18-10 23:21:1]Terek <fighter> seems better, its only going off once per fight if at all wich is a life saver. unless thats luck lol
[Jul 18-10 23:21:49]Nulvect <fighter> it's still random, just with adjusted chances
[Jul 18-10 23:21:57]Terek <fighter> nods
[Jul 19-10 19:45:12]<fighter> Yang needs 50 more con
[Jul 20-10 16:41:5]Demitri <fighter> ouch dex more expensive than str
[Jul 20-10 16:43:37]Demitri <fighter> i still dont fully understand painshift
[Jul 20-10 16:43:57]Nulvect <fighter> help file is pretty clear
[Jul 20-10 16:44:39]Demitri <fighter> ehh guess im not strong enough to see a real differance yet =P

[Jul 24-10 17:6:28]Hrok <fighter> this elf village is kind of confusing
[Jul 24-10 17:8:40]Hrok <fighter> does it go in a circle?
[Jul 24-10 17:8:54]Amaki <fighter> more like a christmas tree
[Jul 24-10 17:8:54]Stormbringer <fighter> yes it does
[Jul 24-10 17:9:4]Hrok <fighter> oh good
[Jul 24-10 17:9:6]Amaki <fighter> lemme help you out with a command. maps on
[Jul 24-10 17:9:14]Stormbringer <fighter> maps won't help him
[Jul 24-10 17:9:18]Amaki <fighter> no?
[Jul 24-10 17:9:20]Hrok <fighter> I'm blind. forgot to say
[Jul 24-10 17:9:26]Amaki <fighter> oh wow
[Jul 24-10 17:9:32]Amaki <fighter> didnt figure that
[Jul 24-10 17:9:36]Stormbringer <fighter> readers don't get maps
[Jul 24-10 17:9:38]Amaki <fighter> good luck tho
[Jul 24-10 17:9:54]Amaki <fighter> Hrok, you're my new role model. :)
[Jul 24-10 17:9:58]Stormbringer <fighter> heh
[Jul 24-10 17:10:6]Hrok <fighter> cool
[Jul 24-10 17:10:30]Stormbringer <fighter> anyhow, I am off again
[Jul 24-10 17:10:42]Hrok <fighter> ok
[Jul 24-10 17:11:22]Hrok <fighter> ok found the exit
[Jul 24-10 17:11:28]Hrok <fighter> of elfville
[Jul 24-10 17:22:16]Hrok <fighter> can you run tose things we killed earlier? the cave things
[Jul 24-10 17:22:30]Amaki <fighter> here are the directions from the square
[Jul 24-10 17:22:54]Amaki <fighter> 9 west, gate, 3 or 4 west, northwest, search shrubs
[Jul 24-10 17:23:2]Hrok <fighter> thanks
[Jul 24-10 17:23:22]Amaki <fighter> survey before you enter a room
[Jul 24-10 17:23:28]Amaki <fighter> aekari will kill you!
[Jul 24-10 17:23:34]Amaki <fighter> they auto attack
[Jul 24-10 17:23:38]Amaki <fighter> myconids dont
[Jul 24-10 17:23:42]Hrok <fighter> what'll kill me? missed it
[Jul 24-10 17:23:50]Amaki <fighter> aekari will kill you
[Jul 24-10 17:24:0]Amaki <fighter> aekari warriors are bad
[Jul 24-10 17:24:6]Amaki <fighter> aekari mages are even worse
[Jul 24-10 17:24:8]Hrok <fighter> ok
[Jul 24-10 17:24:20]Amaki <fighter> so survey before entering a room
[Jul 24-10 17:24:26]Amaki <fighter> after you search shrubs
[Jul 24-10 17:24:28]Hrok <fighter> ok
[Jul 24-10 17:24:34]Hrok <fighter> killing now
[Jul 24-10 17:24:42]Amaki <fighter> awesome. :)
[Jul 24-10 17:25:12]Hrok <fighter> had to run for some reason
[Jul 24-10 17:26:22]Hrok <fighter> scrue it how do I get out of here?
[Jul 24-10 17:26:30]Hrok <fighter> oh nvm
[Jul 24-10 17:29:24]Hrok <fighter> what lvl do you have to be to max blade and stuff?
[Jul 24-10 17:29:36]Amaki <fighter> you can train blade at any level
[Jul 24-10 17:29:46]Amaki <fighter> get back to the room you rolled your stats in
[Jul 24-10 17:29:48]Hrok <fighter> I know but after a while it says you need another lvl
[Jul 24-10 17:29:58]Amaki <fighter> then you have maxxed it
[Jul 24-10 17:30:4]Amaki <fighter> type abilities
[Jul 24-10 17:30:6]Hrok <fighter> oh
[Jul 24-10 17:30:10]Amaki <fighter> you should have slash now
[Jul 24-10 17:30:26]Amaki <fighter> slash is much more powerful than jab
[Jul 24-10 17:30:38]Hrok <fighter> nope cause advanced so not maxed any more
[Jul 24-10 17:31:0]Amaki <fighter> it doesnt go away when you level
[Jul 24-10 17:31:8]Amaki <fighter> it only takes 20 blade to gain slash
[Jul 24-10 17:31:16]Amaki <fighter> you never lose the ability
[Jul 24-10 17:31:16]Hrok <fighter> hmm
[Jul 24-10 17:31:26]Amaki <fighter> unless your skill is below 20 for some reason
[Jul 24-10 17:31:36]Amaki <fighter> but newbie death doesnt let you lose levels
[Jul 24-10 17:31:42]Hrok <fighter> it says 42
[Jul 24-10 17:31:46]Hrok <fighter> but no slash
[Jul 24-10 17:32:2]Amaki <fighter> it should be under weapon
[Jul 24-10 17:32:10]Amaki <fighter> what is attack skill?
[Jul 24-10 17:32:22]Hrok <fighter> 42 (42)
[Jul 24-10 17:32:32]Amaki <fighter> blade skill?
[Jul 24-10 17:32:56]Hrok <fighter> blade skill? knife skill no blade
[Jul 24-10 17:33:4]Amaki <fighter> that is the problem
[Jul 24-10 17:33:8]Amaki <fighter> train blade
[Jul 24-10 17:33:16]Amaki <fighter> it is different from knife
[Jul 24-10 17:33:26]Hrok <fighter> oh
[Jul 24-10 17:33:36]Amaki <fighter> blade is for big swords, knife is just for small little knives like rogues use
[Jul 24-10 17:36:54]Hrok <fighter> got slash
[Jul 24-10 17:37:40]Hrok <fighter> where's general store? want a recall thing
[Jul 24-10 17:37:54]Amaki <fighter> are you still in Elfy town?
[Jul 24-10 17:38:10]Hrok <fighter> no went home and got slash
[Jul 24-10 17:38:20]Amaki <fighter> ooo, go to the supply store
[Jul 24-10 17:38:26]Hrok <fighter> but how do I buy a recall thing? where's store?
[Jul 24-10 17:38:28]Amaki <fighter> from square: w,n,supply
[Jul 24-10 17:38:32]Hrok <fighter> oh
[Jul 24-10 17:38:36]Amaki <fighter> it is called seal of tirun
[Jul 24-10 17:39:2]Hrok <fighter> 3 should be enough for now
[Jul 24-10 17:39:20]Hrok <fighter> how do I use it if I need it?
[Jul 24-10 17:39:26]Amaki <fighter> break seal
[Jul 24-10 17:39:32]Hrok <fighter> ok
[Jul 24-10 17:40:48]Hrok <fighter> think jab was faster
[Jul 24-10 17:40:56]Amaki <fighter> heh, did you max blade?
[Jul 24-10 17:41:4]Hrok <fighter> no
[Jul 24-10 17:41:8]Hrok <fighter> not enough xp
[Jul 24-10 17:41:12]Amaki <fighter> ahhh

[Jul 26-10 12:15:17]Hrok <fighter> those jokes are aging fast
[Jul 26-10 12:15:23]Stormbringer <fighter> ok ok
[Jul 26-10 12:15:25]Ardkoor <fighter> clear!
[Jul 26-10 12:15:33]<fighter> Ardkoor breaks out the paddles!
[Jul 26-10 12:15:43]Hrok <fighter> there needs to be a joke channel
[Jul 26-10 12:15:59]Ardkoor <fighter> I think it could be awesome if I got a faerie berserker really high
[Jul 26-10 12:16:23]Ardkoor <fighter> could you imagine a little faerie just flittering all around the place, goin' crazy?
[Jul 26-10 12:16:34]Hrok <fighter> rofl

[Jul 26-10 12:17:35]Hrok <fighter> what guild?
[Jul 26-10 12:17:46]Ardkoor <fighter> there is a web show called The Guild
[Jul 26-10 12:17:50]Ardkoor <fighter> it is awesome. :)
[Jul 26-10 12:17:54]Hrok <fighter> oh
[Jul 26-10 12:18:6]Ardkoor <fighter> good audio too, you should check it out
[Jul 26-10 12:18:26]Hrok <fighter> stormbringer how do you do cool stuff like move lpayers or move objects in building?
[Jul 26-10 12:18:34]Hrok <fighter> players
[Jul 26-10 12:18:50]Ardkoor <fighter> that reminds me, you have any favorite movies, Hrok?
[Jul 26-10 12:18:58]Hrok <fighter> hmm
[Jul 26-10 12:19:10]Hrok <fighter> like a bunch of movies don't have favourites
[Jul 26-10 12:19:23]Ardkoor <fighter> ever check out The princess Bride?
[Jul 26-10 12:19:35]Hrok <fighter> er. not a girl
[Jul 26-10 12:19:42]Ardkoor <fighter> dude, epic audio
[Jul 26-10 12:19:47]Ardkoor <fighter> you dont have to be a gurl.
[Jul 26-10 12:19:47]Hrok <fighter> why?
[Jul 26-10 12:19:58]Hrok <fighter> why not? sounds girly fairytale
[Jul 26-10 12:20:18]Ardkoor <fighter> the movie is so good, I used to listen to it on audio tape in the car and it held up marvelous
[Jul 26-10 12:20:27]Hrok <fighter> and it's about?

[Jul 26-10 12:20:46]Hrok <fighter> and it's about?
[Jul 26-10 12:20:54]Ardkoor <fighter> a poor farm boy falls in love with a princess and rescues her from some royal douchebag
[Jul 26-10 12:21:3]Stormbringer <fighter> the princess bride is a snarky hero movie
[Jul 26-10 12:21:6]Hrok <fighter> yep. fairrytale
[Jul 26-10 12:21:18]Ardkoor <fighter> you're playing a fairy tale. :)
[Jul 26-10 12:21:27]Stormbringer <fighter> it has slap stick and lots of off the wall jokes

[Jul 26-10 12:21:30]Hrok <fighter> no I'm not. I'm not playing a fairy race
[Jul 26-10 12:21:39]Ardkoor <fighter> no, I'm a faerie race. Yer a giant
[Jul 26-10 12:21:42]Hrok <fighter> you fixed hauntedhouse thing stormbringer?
[Jul 26-10 12:21:50]Ardkoor <fighter> give it a little time, Hrok. :)
[Jul 26-10 12:21:59]Hrok <fighter> huh?
[Jul 26-10 12:22:38]Ardkoor <fighter> Stormy has all that real life stuff to handle so it takes time to fix quests
[Jul 26-10 12:22:55]Hrok <fighter> can you just give me completed quest? I figured it out got into elevator and did lever
[Jul 26-10 12:24:27]Hrok <fighter> hello?
[Jul 26-10 12:26:15]Ardkoor <fighter> He works from home so he goes idle at odd times sometimes
[Jul 26-10 12:26:23]Hrok <fighter> oh
[Jul 26-10 12:27:27]Stormbringer <fighter> sorry Hrok, we will get it fixed up
[Jul 26-10 12:27:42]Hrok <fighter> can I just have dragon race? think it leads to that
[Jul 26-10 12:27:50]Stormbringer <fighter> dragonis closed

[Jul 26-10 12:28:38]Ardkoor <fighter> oh Stormbringer, I did the quest to get <pwn> command. It won't show up but trust me I did.
[Jul 26-10 12:28:50]Hrok <fighter> pwn command?
[Jul 26-10 12:29:18]Ardkoor <fighter> is a command I dreamed up to instakill or pwn just about anything
[Jul 26-10 12:29:27]Ardkoor <fighter> more jokes. :)
[Jul 26-10 12:29:31]Hrok <fighter> doh
[Jul 26-10 12:29:42]Ardkoor <fighter> I should log on my jester if I keep this up!
[Jul 26-10 12:29:43]Hrok <fighter> 1 minute till repop
[Jul 26-10 12:29:54]Hrok <fighter> there is no jester
[Jul 26-10 12:30:3]Ardkoor <fighter> sure there is
[Jul 26-10 12:30:50]Stormbringer <fighter> they are wanderers
[Jul 26-10 12:30:51]Ardkoor <fighter> finger axenos
[Jul 26-10 12:30:59]Hrok <fighter> oh
[Jul 26-10 12:31:39]Ardkoor <fighter> wanderers are pretty cool
[Jul 26-10 12:31:47]Hrok <fighter> what can they do?
[Jul 26-10 12:31:50]Ardkoor <fighter> swashbucklers are strong!
[Jul 26-10 12:31:59]Ardkoor <fighter> bards have songs that give you all kinds of increases
[Jul 26-10 12:32:3]Hrok <fighter> what level do you need to be for swashbucklers? wouldn't let me join
[Jul 26-10 12:32:15]Ardkoor <fighter> 1st, you need to choose wanderer
[Jul 26-10 12:32:22]Ardkoor <fighter> instead of fighter
[Jul 26-10 12:32:22]Hrok <fighter> oh
[Jul 26-10 12:32:27]Ardkoor <fighter> then you can become a swashbuckler
[Jul 26-10 12:32:38]Ardkoor <fighter> i would suggest making an alt for that
[Jul 26-10 12:32:47]Hrok <fighter> can't be bothered atm
[Jul 26-10 12:32:50]Ardkoor <fighter> but warrior and swash are a bit close
[Jul 26-10 12:33:6]Ardkoor <fighter> swash a bit funner, I'd say
[Jul 26-10 12:33:18]Ardkoor <fighter> but I am high on my swashbuckler, Khroxas
[Jul 26-10 12:33:27]Hrok <fighter> o
[Jul 26-10 12:33:30]Hrok <fighter> ooops oh
[Jul 26-10 12:34:31]Ardkoor <fighter> *switches characters*
[Jul 26-10 12:43:51]Hrok <fighter> how do I exit this guild hall?
[Aug 1-10 21:54:33]Balder <fighter> is Razorcloud a dot spell?
[Aug 1-10 21:55:29]Nulvect <fighter> sort of
[Aug 1-10 21:55:35]Balder <fighter> mm roger
[Aug 1-10 21:56:3]Nulvect <fighter> bleeding is a damage over time effect, but the spell itself only hits in that one round
[Aug 1-10 21:56:7]Balder <fighter> anti has so many cool abils :p
[Aug 1-10 21:56:19]Balder <fighter> ahh ok
[Aug 1-10 21:56:23]Nulvect <fighter> hehe thanks
[Aug 1-10 21:56:27]Balder <fighter> am trying to work out how to play the class

[Aug 2-10 18:38:38]Hrok <fighter> hi
[Aug 2-10 18:39:8]Kon <fighter> lot of fighters on. :)
[Aug 2-10 18:39:20]Hrok <fighter> oh
[Aug 2-10 18:39:28]Kon <fighter> Hey Hrok, what's your blade skill?
[Aug 2-10 18:39:34]Hrok <fighter> I'll check
[Aug 2-10 18:40:4]Hrok <fighter> maxed at 72
[Aug 2-10 18:40:28]Kon <fighter> at 75 blade, you can wield forbidden cutlasses. I have some of those as well. :)
[Aug 2-10 18:40:46]Hrok <fighter> how good a weapon are they? better than tainted sword?
[Aug 2-10 18:40:52]Kon <fighter> by far
[Aug 2-10 18:41:2]Hrok <fighter> nice
[Aug 2-10 18:41:12]Kon <fighter> a chance to paralyze enemy too
[Aug 2-10 18:41:18]Hrok <fighter> wow
[Aug 2-10 18:41:26]Hrok <fighter> I'll level and increase it
[Aug 2-10 18:41:30]Kon <fighter> not very long but every round counts
[Aug 2-10 18:41:36]Kon <fighter> sadly, it never autoloads
[Aug 2-10 18:41:44]Kon <fighter> but you have 2 lockers. :)
[Aug 2-10 18:41:44]Hrok <fighter> #!!! it
[Aug 2-10 18:42:0]Hrok <fighter> ok which item is worst battlefield shield or
[Aug 2-10 18:42:16]Hrok <fighter> acrylite chainmail leggings?
[Aug 2-10 18:42:36]Kon <fighter> hmmm, I can compare if you want
[Aug 2-10 18:42:44]Hrok <fighter> i can do that
[Aug 2-10 18:42:46]Kon <fighter> you might have compare as well
[Aug 2-10 18:42:58]Kon <fighter> shield covers more limbs usually
[Aug 2-10 18:43:10]Hrok <fighter> they're equal. which one protects me more?
[Aug 2-10 18:43:12]Kon <fighter> making it better in my opinion
[Aug 2-10 18:43:20]Hrok <fighter> shield. right
[Aug 2-10 18:43:32]Kon <fighter> I make better leggings than those acrilite pieces of poo!
[Aug 2-10 18:43:46]Hrok <fighter> how do you make leggings?
[Aug 2-10 18:43:56]Kon <fighter> rangers make all kinds of things. :)
[Aug 2-10 18:44:2]Kon <fighter> help make
[Aug 2-10 18:44:2]Hrok <fighter> can you make lvl 13 ones?
[Aug 2-10 18:44:22]Kon <fighter> mine are way above level 13 but you can still wear them
[Aug 2-10 18:44:42]Kon <fighter> here, armour anyone can wear. Weapons, some need certain skill to wield
[Aug 2-10 18:45:26]Hrok <fighter> do they autoload?
[Aug 2-10 18:45:32]Kon <fighter> sadly, no

[Aug 10-10 19:28:8]Hrok <fighter> how do you code a skill on admin thing anyway?
[Aug 10-10 19:32:40]Nulvect <fighter> it's complicated

[Aug 10-10 19:33:4]Nulvect <fighter> nope
[Aug 10-10 19:33:10]Hrok <fighter> how do you do it then?

[Oct 18-10 12:31:46]Janos <fighter> it says it swweps your foe off their feet but they dont fall down anymore with that
[Oct 18-10 12:32:12]Janos <fighter> You sweep your foe off their feet
[Oct 18-10 12:33:34]Nulvect <fighter> hmm looks like it was just poorly written to begin with... I can fix it

[Oct 24-10 4:15:27]Adrym <fighter> is zerk melee supposed to be that expensive?
[Oct 24-10 4:15:29]Janos <fighter> Nul!
[Oct 24-10 4:15:51]Nulvect <fighter> it's not expensive at all
[Oct 24-10 4:15:59]Adrym <fighter> it is more than attack or axe
[Oct 24-10 4:16:15]Nulvect <fighter> sorry, but that is wrong
[Oct 24-10 4:16:25]Adrym <fighter> nod thought so :D
[Oct 24-10 4:16:37]Nulvect <fighter> no I mean what you said is wrong
[Oct 24-10 4:16:47]Adrym <fighter> zz
[Oct 24-10 4:17:24]Adrym <fighter> i went from 30 to 33 in 5k for attack and 30 to 31 1/2 in 5k for melee
[Oct 24-10 4:21:48]Nulvect <fighter> yes, but you seemed to indicate that attack and axe cost the same
[Oct 24-10 4:22:21]Adrym <fighter> umm actually im not sure about that but melee definitely costs more than attack
[Oct 24-10 4:22:46]Nulvect <fighter> attack is incredibly cheap, melee is just cheap
[Oct 24-10 4:22:50]Adrym <fighter> ah

[Oct 26-10 17:32:27]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^doh
[Oct 26-10 17:50:7]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^lol i notice a difference =P

[Oct 27-10 0:47:33]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul when you are wielding a sword or whatever and you sharpen it at the end of it it says You sharpen your (weapon). no longer states that its wielded
[Oct 27-10 0:48:21]Nulvect <fighter> nod, that's on purpose
[Oct 27-10 0:48:37]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ooo?
[Oct 27-10 0:48:41]Nulvect <fighter> having (wielded) show up all the time looked like crap
[Oct 27-10 0:49:7]Nulvect <fighter> looking at a weapon tells you if it's wielded now though
[Oct 27-10 0:49:25]Nulvect <fighter> and of course it shows in inventory
[Oct 27-10 0:49:43]Nulvect <fighter> so you can still 'wield sword' 'sharpen sword' and they're guaranteed to be the same one
[Oct 27-10 0:49:53]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^k
[Oct 27-10 0:56:33]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^just kinda hope i dont get pk'd by some rogue that has half my stats

[Nov 17-10 1:27:18]Mrityudand <fighter> i dont have it
[Nov 17-10 1:27:48]Thaedis <fighter> ohhh ur not really a zerk:P
[Nov 17-10 1:27:54]Mrityudand <fighter> no :P
[Nov 17-10 1:37:44]Thaedis <fighter> does being drunk help rage by any chance?
[Nov 17-10 1:37:58]Mrityudand <fighter> not that i know of no
[Nov 17-10 1:55:16]Thaedis <fighter> thanks for the help:) peace out
[Nov 17-10 23:19:36]Mrityudand <fighter> hey nul
[Nov 17-10 23:20:8]Mrityudand <fighter> i cant warblade ppl 20+ dex below me
[Nov 17-10 23:20:10]Mrityudand <fighter> is that normal?
[Nov 17-10 23:53:20]Nulvect <fighter> I dunno, let me look
[Nov 17-10 23:54:18]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm, I guess this formula doesn't really make sense when you put it like that
[Nov 17-10 23:54:24]Mrityudand <fighter> nod
[Nov 17-10 23:55:29]Nulvect <fighter> try that
[Nov 18-10 1:19:52]Thaedis <fighter> whats a good sword for lvl 10?
[Nov 24-10 2:16:10]Yang <fighter> bah another magic user that again has the ability to render this char useless
[Nov 25-10 23:12:35]Rohl <fighter> Nul, do you already have the new warrior/paladin abil/spell in mind?
[Nov 25-10 23:14:17]Nulvect <fighter> warrior yes, paladin not really
[Nov 25-10 23:14:23]Rohl <fighter> ah
[Nov 25-10 23:15:57]Rohl <fighter> I was just thinkin, it would be cool if warriors could get special items to enhance combat. Like weapon chains maybe add an extra idle hit to combat, or a whetstone for a selfbuff to blade. idk just random ideas :P
[Nov 25-10 23:17:15]Rohl <fighter> since a warrior isn't much of a buffing class, maybe they could attain warrior-exclusive accessories for minor buffs
[Nov 25-10 23:20:1]Nulvect <fighter> they will specialize in dual wielding different kinds of weapons together
[Nov 28-10 5:52:36]Yang <fighter> sup Terek

[Nov 29-10 0:52:12]Nulvect <fighter> blah fine, I adjusted ambush a little
[Nov 29-10 0:52:30]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^haha
[Nov 29-10 0:52:54]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^common tho you get my point tho right?
[Nov 29-10 0:53:10]Nulvect <fighter> yeah I guess
[Nov 29-10 0:53:20]<fighter> Yang slaps his forehead
[Nov 29-10 0:53:24]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ok
[Nov 29-10 0:53:30]Nulvect <fighter> should be easier to defend against things
[Nov 29-10 0:53:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^k thnx
[Nov 29-10 14:35:10]Mrityudand <fighter> i think ressurect should be changed around somewhat so you dont lose lvls or somn when you get ressurected
[Nov 29-10 14:35:22]Mrityudand <fighter> would help in diminishing the dominance of demons and angels
[Nov 29-10 14:36:10]Nulvect <fighter> I plan to change how death works a little, right now it does not keep track of what you lose so I can't really make res give it back
[Nov 29-10 14:36:18]Mrityudand <fighter> nod
[Nov 29-10 14:36:30]Mrityudand <fighter> mebbe make it so that you lose the lvls etc when you pray
[Nov 29-10 14:36:46]Mrityudand <fighter> gods penalize you for giving you life or whatnot
[Dec 3-10 3:13:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^bah my hack still cant insta 25ks???
[Dec 3-10 4:26:10]Yang <fighter> its funny how dragons are more resistant to slash but we have a Dragon Slayer thats a blade... what else would we do with the blade besides slash with it?
[Dec 5-10 1:7:34]Yang <fighter> err that was kinda wierd
[Dec 5-10 1:8:10]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^charge hits rush/lag/warblade hits then rush hits next round
[Dec 5-10 1:8:12]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ouch
[Dec 5-10 1:12:34]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^psh at least you have more than 3 moves :P
[Dec 5-10 1:12:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^lol
[Dec 6-10 3:13:21]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^at random times i cant rush after charge hits, it says im still charging fyi
[Dec 6-10 3:13:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^
[Dec 6-10 3:28:7]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^also happens when i miss my char goo
[Dec 6-10 3:28:21]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^charge too*
[Dec 6-10 3:42:39]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^typical
[Dec 8-10 2:4:50]Yang <fighter> wow dragons get serious attack and def per lvl
[Dec 11-10 2:32:21]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sure hope Nul makes charge quicker with skills
[Dec 11-10 2:32:31]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hint hint
[Dec 13-10 2:6:55]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^all i want for Christmas is a faster charge
[Dec 14-10 4:57:16]Nulvect <fighter> psst, I might sneak in a warrior abil before sorc is done :P
[Dec 14-10 4:58:0]Yang <fighter> woot!
[Dec 18-10 2:17:13]<fighter> Rohl is sad that strength does nothing for warblade
[Dec 18-10 2:18:3]Mrityudand <fighter> yeah i noticed that as well
[Dec 18-10 2:18:13]Mrityudand <fighter> if it does then its not a lot
[Dec 18-10 2:24:6]Nulvect <fighter> it certainly does help it... and I adjusted warblade a tiny bit just now
[Dec 18-10 2:27:4]Mrityudand <fighter> cool
[Dec 18-10 2:27:4]Mrityudand <fighter> cool
[Dec 18-10 2:27:8]Mrityudand <fighter> oops
[Dec 18-10 2:27:14]Mrityudand <fighter> thanks nul
[Dec 18-10 2:27:32]Mrityudand <fighter> whats the deal with extra warblade hits doing 0 dmg?
[Dec 18-10 2:28:10]Rohl <fighter> I just got str from 100 to 118 and I dont do anymore damage on 25ks
[Dec 18-10 2:28:16]Rohl <fighter> idle hits do heaps more
[Dec 18-10 2:28:20]Rohl <fighter> but not warblade :/
[Dec 18-10 2:31:24]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm, dunno mrit
[Dec 18-10 2:31:32]Nulvect <fighter> I'll see if I can fix that
[Dec 18-10 2:32:18]Nulvect <fighter> ah, think I see what the problem was, should be fixed now
[Dec 19-10 2:32:43]Rohl <fighter> As a skilled weapon-master.. is there any way I could get flog? :P
[Dec 19-10 22:54:12]Eios <fighter> lol, can charge while resting
[Dec 19-10 22:54:30]Cenn <fighter> nicesz
[Dec 19-10 22:54:32]Nulvect <fighter> doh
[Dec 19-10 22:54:46]Cenn <fighter> i need to try charge
[Dec 19-10 22:55:6]Eios <fighter> Just place a check in it yeah?
[Dec 19-10 22:55:46]Nulvect <fighter> k, should be fixed
[Dec 19-10 22:56:12]Eios <fighter> gg!
[Dec 19-10 22:56:44]Eios <fighter> Diamonds don't do much weight reduction these days?
[Dec 19-10 22:57:24]Eios <fighter> oooh, nm
[Dec 20-10 1:47:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nerfed
[Dec 20-10 1:47:30]Rohl <fighter> yea this is my last day as warrior :P
[Dec 20-10 1:47:50]Eios <fighter> What was nerfd?
[Dec 20-10 1:48:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^yeah not sure whats up been testing it recently somethin aint right
[Dec 20-10 1:48:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^testing charge that is
[Dec 20-10 1:49:8]Eios <fighter> I'm liking charge, but I haven't been around in a while
[Dec 20-10 1:49:20]Cenn <fighter> according to my test earlier in arena, rush was better than charge
[Dec 20-10 2:6:8]Nulvect <fighter> ok, the formula for hitting with charge has been tweaked
[Dec 20-10 2:6:20]Cenn <fighter> so yang is buff again?
[Dec 20-10 2:7:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nah not even close yet :P
[Dec 20-10 2:9:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^thnx Nul
[Dec 20-10 2:9:48]Nulvect <fighter> nod
[Dec 20-10 2:28:40]Nulvect <fighter> charge has been tweaked a bit more in terms of damage and cost
[Dec 20-10 2:28:52]Cenn <fighter> yangs gonna jump with joy P
[Dec 20-10 2:28:56]<fighter> Yang jumps
[Dec 20-10 2:29:10]<fighter> Yang joys too
[Dec 20-10 3:55:59]Amaki <fighter> FIGHTERMUD!!!
[Dec 20-10 17:3:47]Mrityudand <fighter> hey nul
[Dec 20-10 17:3:57]Nulvect <fighter> hey
[Dec 20-10 17:4:5]Mrityudand <fighter> was flog changed?
[Dec 20-10 17:4:11]Nulvect <fighter> not that I recall
[Dec 20-10 17:4:51]Mrityudand <fighter> with 160 dex im still only getting 2 extra hits
[Dec 20-10 17:5:1]Mrityudand <fighter> i started getting 2 extras at 110
[Dec 20-10 17:5:31]Mrityudand <fighter> or is it base stat based?
[Dec 20-10 17:9:9]Nulvect <fighter> skills and stats are both important
[Dec 20-10 17:9:13]Mrityudand <fighter> nod
[Dec 20-10 17:9:25]Mrityudand <fighter> ok so im guessing its different from warblade
[Dec 20-10 17:9:39]Mrityudand <fighter> warblade gives a new hit like every 20 dex
[Dec 20-10 17:14:24]Cenn <fighter> was hew fixed with the warblade fix?  i figure theyre similar spells so it migt have a similar issue
[Dec 20-10 17:14:55]Nulvect <fighter> yes, due to differences in damage calculation and that flog can do extra stuff, extra hits are calculated differently... nothing's been done to hew
[Dec 20-10 17:15:5]Mrityudand <fighter> cool thanks :D
[Dec 20-10 17:15:59]Nulvect <fighter> the "fix" to warblade was only a minor damage tweak, and I don't think hew needs that
[Dec 20-10 17:16:25]Nulvect <fighter> or wait, do you mean the extra hits??
[Dec 20-10 17:17:13]Nulvect <fighter> if hew's extra hits are doing 0 damage let me know, but I have to go now
[Dec 20-10 17:17:29]Cenn <fighter> idk if they are haha
[Dec 21-10 3:47:11]Mrityudand <fighter> hey nul
[Dec 21-10 3:47:14]Mrityudand <fighter> my whips dont kill things...
[Dec 21-10 3:48:8]Nulvect <fighter> yes, that's the default for whips
[Dec 21-10 3:48:18]Mrityudand <fighter> thats kinda harsh :(
[Dec 21-10 3:48:36]Nulvect <fighter> the 'whip' ability, as well as flog, can kill things
[Dec 21-10 3:48:50]Mrityudand <fighter> nod
[Dec 21-10 3:49:10]Nulvect <fighter> I'll reconsider it, but it just seemed more natural... pretty hard to kill someone with a whip
[Dec 21-10 3:49:26]Mrityudand <fighter> i mean if you beat someone up enough it can kill them
[Dec 21-10 3:49:36]Mrityudand <fighter> and in our case beating someone up enough is dropping em to 0 hp
[Dec 21-10 3:50:26]Nulvect <fighter> well I'll think about it
[Dec 21-10 3:50:35]Mrityudand <fighter> kk cool :D
[Dec 24-10 2:51:11]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^my str is expensive
[Dec 25-10 23:15:32]Mrityudand <fighter> hey nul
[Dec 25-10 23:15:42]Mrityudand <fighter> ferocity got anything to dow ith flog at all?
[Dec 25-10 23:25:51]Nulvect <fighter> quite possibly
[Dec 26-10 0:18:25]Mrityudand <fighter> yes it does, thanks nul :D
[Dec 26-10 1:40:51]Mrityudand <fighter> hey nul
[Dec 26-10 1:41:13]Nulvect <fighter> hey...
[Dec 26-10 1:41:21]Mrityudand <fighter> sorry to bother you again :P
[Dec 26-10 1:41:49]Mrityudand <fighter> just wanted to say great job with flog :D
[Dec 26-10 1:42:9]Nulvect <fighter> heh thanks
[Dec 26-10 1:42:17]Nulvect <fighter> it can get a bit spammy though
[Dec 26-10 1:42:21]Mrityudand <fighter> nod
[Dec 26-10 1:42:33]Mrityudand <fighter> im not dropping mobs yet but its awesome nonetheless
[Dec 26-10 1:42:45]Mrityudand <fighter> cause i thought i would be stuck with warblade but flog is awesome damage as well
[Dec 26-10 1:43:5]Nulvect <fighter> both are viable yeah
[Dec 26-10 1:43:19]Mrityudand <fighter> btw is flog slash dmg?
[Dec 26-10 1:44:25]Nulvect <fighter> it has not been updated to use damage types yet, but it will probably depend on the weapon you use
[Dec 26-10 1:44:33]Mrityudand <fighter> hmm
[Dec 26-10 1:44:51]Mrityudand <fighter> somehow it takes me an extra flog to kill drakes i thought that was the reason
[Dec 26-10 1:44:55]Nulvect <fighter> a morning star is impact + pierce for example, whereas a normal whip is impact + slash
[Dec 26-10 1:45:5]Mrityudand <fighter> nod
[Dec 26-10 1:45:17]Mrityudand <fighter> Oo
[Dec 26-10 1:45:25]Mrityudand <fighter> btw can morning stars be made so they can land killing blows?
[Dec 26-10 1:45:41]Nulvect <fighter> makes sense
[Dec 26-10 1:45:45]Mrityudand <fighter> nod
[Dec 26-10 1:45:53]Nulvect <fighter> are the lodos ones the only morning stars around??
[Dec 26-10 1:46:1]Mrityudand <fighter> the new deathbringers as well
[Dec 26-10 1:47:7]Mrityudand <fighter> i would press on that whips should land killing blows too tho :P
[Dec 26-10 1:47:17]Mrityudand <fighter> cause it will kinda be rough on 2 handed fighters
[Dec 26-10 1:48:1]Mrityudand <fighter> i being raknid can atleast wield 2 other weapons to land the killing blow but 2 handed races might take 1-2 rounds extra to land the killing blow as we depend a lot on round dmg
[Dec 26-10 1:50:29]Mrityudand <fighter> btw more dex will still get me more flog hits right?
[Dec 26-10 1:50:39]Nulvect <fighter> I don't give out info like that
[Dec 26-10 1:50:49]Mrityudand <fighter> ah kk sorry bout that
[Dec 26-10 1:52:57]Mrityudand <fighter> I will let you get back to work, great job with flog and hope you had a merry christmas :)
[Dec 26-10 1:53:21]Nulvect <fighter> you too
[Dec 26-10 1:56:11]Nulvect <fighter> ok, after thinking about it, I set the default for flails so they can kill, but do no body damage
[Dec 26-10 1:56:25]Nulvect <fighter> might take until reboot for that to fully take effect
[Dec 26-10 1:56:31]Mrityudand <fighter> kk cool thanks :)
[Dec 26-10 1:56:47]Nulvect <fighter> the morning stars I just modified will do body damage as you'd expect
[Dec 26-10 1:56:53]Mrityudand <fighter> i will let you know how it works out :)
[Dec 26-10 1:56:55]Mrityudand <fighter> cool
[Dec 26-10 1:57:17]Mrityudand <fighter> will quittingout help or will i just have to wait till boot?
[Dec 26-10 1:58:25]Nulvect <fighter> each affected weapon will have to be reloaded into memory, which means none of it can be used for a while so the current version is purged
[Dec 26-10 1:58:35]Mrityudand <fighter> kk
[Dec 26-10 6:19:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nulvect on your chfn you forgot to put in warrior

[Dec 29-10 13:59:29]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul ever think about letting some active players be able to delete class posts?
[Dec 29-10 13:59:41]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^wow telnet has its own language
[Dec 29-10 14:0:29]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i could clean up fighter board for ya
[Dec 29-10 14:0:59]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^just stupid stuff like "1st post" or things buy unused players/deleted players
[Dec 29-10 14:4:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sup Josh
[Dec 29-10 14:6:34]Nulvect <fighter> hmmm, that's not a bad idea in general, but picking who's "active" would be pretty arbitrary
[Dec 29-10 14:6:43]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ME!
[Dec 29-10 14:6:47]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^lol jk
[Dec 29-10 14:10:12]Nulvect <fighter> so are you saying the fighter board is full of junk??
[Dec 29-10 14:10:17]Nulvect <fighter> hehe
[Dec 29-10 14:26:3]Nulvect <fighter> ok, cleaned up a lot of cruft on the fighter board
[Dec 29-10 14:50:10]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^bah ask.com and google.com not helping
[Dec 29-10 14:52:46]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^dualstrike is nice
[Dec 29-10 14:56:4]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^crossweave would make it more class specific
[Dec 29-10 14:56:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^strike is real generic, i agree and wanderers have strike =P
[Dec 29-10 15:48:10]Nulvect <fighter> I had hoped to get it done before I leave, but I don't think that's going to happen... but at least now there's a skeleton of it
[Dec 29-10 15:49:51]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oooo
[Dec 29-10 15:50:31]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^crossweave is good, it makes it custom to warriors
[Dec 29-10 15:51:7]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^i dont have a comp at home anymore and woman wontlet me use hers
[Dec 29-10 15:51:29]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^think ill have to hand write it and type it here on my break

[Jan 1-11 19:45:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^WOOT
[Jan 1-11 19:45:40]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sounds like crazy coding tho
[Jan 1-11 19:46:58]Amon <fighter> neato
[Jan 2-11 19:13:17]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^dang i want skills like a dragon does
[Jan 3-11 15:18:25]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^always wondered why there was a pause after i initiate with hack or warblade
[Jan 7-11 21:52:53]Demitri <fighter> hey Nul you back for good?
[Jan 9-11 4:2:41]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^jeez
[Jan 9-11 4:2:53]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^im no good at this lvl either
[Jan 10-11 16:52:25]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sup Nul
[Jan 10-11 16:55:49]Nulvect <fighter> hey yang
[Jan 10-11 16:56:19]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^how was the trip?
[Jan 10-11 17:1:43]Nulvect <fighter> was good... got quite a bit done on that ability
[Jan 10-11 17:2:0]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kool!
[Jan 10-11 17:2:6]Nulvect <fighter> though I got another idea today and need to reconcile the two
[Jan 10-11 17:2:18]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^?
[Jan 10-11 17:2:31]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^uh oh here comes the suspense
[Jan 10-11 17:3:31]Nulvect <fighter> my new idea would interact with the ability I was making so I have to figure out how to make them work together so they're cool but not overpowered
[Jan 10-11 17:3:53]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nod
[Jan 10-11 17:4:45]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ever think about what we talked about before? bout making charge quicker with lvl/skill?
[Jan 10-11 17:5:5]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^it was a while back tho
[Jan 10-11 17:6:47]Nulvect <fighter> well... that would basically make it twice as powerful
[Jan 10-11 17:7:23]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nod
[Jan 10-11 17:7:25]Nulvect <fighter> perhaps an option at higher levels to charge 'hastily' so it does less damage but takes less time too
[Jan 10-11 17:7:59]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^aww smert idea
[Jan 10-11 17:8:41]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^different lvl of charges =P
[Jan 10-11 17:8:55]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^instead of one fixed charge
[Jan 10-11 17:9:53]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^running shorter distance creates less power behind the run... makes sense =P
[Jan 10-11 17:11:31]Nulvect <fighter> might have to save that for paladins though... since charging is going to be a focus for them
[Jan 10-11 17:11:51]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oooo
[Jan 10-11 18:14:53]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^bah i need a faster abil to xp wif
[Jan 10-11 18:25:22]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hey Nul who gets warcry?

[Jan 14-11 20:1:15]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^oooo
[Jan 14-11 20:1:31]Nulvect <fighter> only works with slash right now though, working on the rest
[Jan 14-11 20:1:39]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^sweet
[Jan 14-11 20:1:45]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe

[Jan 14-11 20:10:52]Kon <fighter> %^CYAN%^Ranger%^RED%^Kon%^WHITE%^: %^YELLOW%^sure
[Jan 14-11 20:22:35]Nulvect <fighter> ok, the rest are updated now too
[Jan 14-11 20:51:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hrmm rohl must have some serious dex,
[Jan 14-11 20:51:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^not too much difference, he must have mroe dex
[Jan 14-11 20:52:2]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ooo wonder what his body parts are like
[Jan 14-11 20:52:50]Nulvect <fighter> consider that I use warrior as a high point for damage, so there aren't huge damage increases directly
[Jan 14-11 20:52:58]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^nod nod
[Jan 14-11 20:53:30]Nulvect <fighter> there are some, but every attack affected a little differently
[Jan 14-11 20:53:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^awww
[Jan 14-11 20:53:38]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^ok

[Jan 15-11 4:25:54]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^lol thinking makes my nose bleed
[Jan 15-11 4:26:24]Nulvect <fighter> it's not overtly obvious, but it definitely makes every one of them better in some way
[Jan 15-11 4:26:44]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kool
[Jan 17-11 1:40:4]Tundra <fighter> Is charge better if you wield projectile or two handed?
[Jan 17-11 1:54:12]Nulvect <fighter> I'm not against the idea, post it up
[Jan 20-11 16:32:3]Nicolas <fighter> hail!

[Mar 12-11 3:42:20]Tai <fighter> third round isnt consistant, off and on
[Mar 16-11 17:14:3]Raskolnikov <fighter> hows antipaladin life?
[Mar 16-11 17:14:15]Sopboo <fighter> getting there
[Mar 16-11 17:14:21]Raskolnikov <fighter> flog is a cool ability
[Mar 16-11 17:15:12]Sopboo <fighter> yeah cept sp cost
[Mar 16-11 17:15:18]Raskolnikov <fighter> how much per use?
[Mar 16-11 17:15:34]Sopboo <fighter> 270
[Mar 16-11 17:15:37]Raskolnikov <fighter> owch
[Mar 16-11 17:15:43]Raskolnikov <fighter> pocket cleric time
[Mar 16-11 17:15:54]Sopboo <fighter> pretty much lol
[Mar 16-11 17:16:49]Sopboo <fighter> alignment sucks too
[Mar 16-11 17:16:58]Sopboo <fighter> but other than those 2 things i love it
[Mar 16-11 17:17:0]Raskolnikov <fighter> satanic all the time is rough
[Mar 16-11 17:17:3]Raskolnikov <fighter> right on
[Mar 16-11 17:17:8]Sopboo <fighter> not bad until high lvls
[Mar 16-11 17:17:18]Raskolnikov <fighter> cool to see an antipaladin around. not too many at all played
[Mar 16-11 17:17:43]Raskolnikov <fighter> thats kind of how backstab was on assassin. it was something crazy like 400 sp when ozzy was level 100
[Mar 16-11 17:17:55]Sopboo <fighter> nod
[Mar 16-11 17:18:8]Sopboo <fighter> yeah sp cost used to be nuts
[Mar 16-11 17:18:23]Sopboo <fighter> now its just not worth using lol
[Mar 16-11 17:18:30]Raskolnikov <fighter> lol circle does more i think
[Mar 16-11 17:18:35]Sopboo <fighter> it does
[Mar 16-11 17:19:6]Raskolnikov <fighter> zerker is nice in the sp department. it kills much slower however
[Mar 16-11 17:19:8]Sopboo <fighter> no worries im anti now lol
[Mar 16-11 17:19:13]Raskolnikov <fighter> :)
[Mar 16-11 17:19:36]Sopboo <fighter> cant figure out my spells however
[Mar 16-11 17:19:46]Raskolnikov <fighter> i dont even know what anti has after the changes anymore
[Mar 16-11 17:19:57]Sopboo <fighter> got rend it adds limb damage
[Mar 16-11 17:20:3]Sopboo <fighter> but ive never severed anything
[Mar 16-11 17:20:8]Raskolnikov <fighter> sounds like a novelty for arena
[Mar 16-11 17:20:14]Raskolnikov <fighter> kinda like unknit
[Mar 16-11 17:20:51]Raskolnikov <fighter> i havent been able to figure out warcry for zerkers myself. my stats are probably too low to properly test it
[Mar 16-11 17:20:57]Sopboo <fighter> got razorcloud its kind of longterm damage i guess
[Mar 16-11 17:21:4]Sopboo <fighter> warcry seems to not work
[Mar 16-11 17:21:7]Sopboo <fighter> i have that as well
[Mar 16-11 17:21:13]Raskolnikov <fighter> ahh thats good to know
[Mar 16-11 17:21:58]Sopboo <fighter> love the fighter con
[Mar 16-11 17:22:4]Sopboo <fighter> freakin good stuff
[Mar 16-11 17:23:34]Sopboo <fighter> anti is interesting because they need every stat
[Mar 16-11 17:24:0]Sopboo <fighter> and i think in the longrun they'll be 1 of the strongest classes
[Mar 16-11 17:24:10]Raskolnikov <fighter> right on
[Mar 16-11 17:24:16]Raskolnikov <fighter> nice to have a class that benefits from everything
[Mar 16-11 17:24:21]Raskolnikov <fighter> and ya... love fighter con
[Mar 16-11 17:25:3]Raskolnikov <fighter> i'm feeling like zerker will be very good for lazy exp. it'll never be super fast or super strong for arena, but it will be easy mode at least. rage, wait 15 seconds, repeat
[Mar 16-11 17:25:31]Sopboo <fighter> yeah
[Mar 16-11 17:34:2]Raskolnikov <fighter> mind if i see flog in action?
[Mar 16-11 17:34:17]Sopboo <fighter> sure
[Mar 16-11 17:34:35]Raskolnikov <fighter> very impressive
[Mar 29-11 19:33:24]Freddie <fighter> hall
[Apr 15-11 23:3:1]Terek <fighter> brawn time length is random?
[Apr 15-11 23:3:31]Terek <fighter> its some times only lasting two rounds
[Apr 15-11 23:3:43]Aethion <fighter> it seems random yeah
[Apr 15-11 23:3:58]Terek <fighter> *pout*
[Apr 15-11 23:4:4]Terek <fighter> gives great def boost ho
[Apr 15-11 23:4:28]Aethion <fighter> for sure
[Apr 15-11 23:4:28]Terek <fighter> lol cant say that i need it tho... Defense           85   (45%)  250 ... NOT!
[Apr 15-11 23:5:28]Terek <fighter> or is it dependant on how much sp you start with.......
[Apr 15-11 23:6:18]Terek <fighter> try useing it with full sp
[Apr 15-11 23:6:24]Terek <fighter> seems to last longer
[Apr 15-11 23:8:14]Terek <fighter> line off
[Apr 15-11 23:42:37]Nulvect <fighter> brawn should never last less than 5 rounds
[Apr 15-11 23:43:41]Nulvect <fighter> I take that back, it can sometimes wear off faster during rage
[Apr 22-11 2:53:35]Yang <fighter> err rush is different
[Apr 27-11 15:4:10]Tundra <fighter> all fighter subclasses get 3 high weapon skills, right?
[Apr 27-11 15:4:37]Tundra <fighter> and warrior get them all?
[Apr 27-11 15:7:18]Tundra <fighter> people block fighter line?
[Apr 27-11 15:7:40]Tundra <fighter> bleh, idlers..
[May 3-11 19:46:42]Enska <fighter> i have 500 less skills than my lvl 60 pyromancer :D
[May 3-11 19:47:8]Nulvect <fighter> shrug
[May 3-11 19:47:31]Nulvect <fighter> I could remove the rage skill and waste all the exp berserkers have put into it
[May 3-11 19:47:35]Nulvect <fighter> that's about it though
[May 3-11 19:48:16]Enska <fighter> This is actually cool :D
[May 3-11 19:48:29]Enska <fighter> not only hacking stats O.o
[May 9-11 17:14:56]Enska <fighter> I took the risk and it was worth it :)
[May 12-11 1:49:37]Yang <fighter> hrmm nuthin better to do, guess ill lvl

[Jun 13-11 12:40:0]Enska <fighter> are there any other blunt abilities than bash?
[Jun 13-11 12:51:23]Nulvect <fighter> think so
[Jun 13-11 12:52:7]Enska <fighter> maybe i should max and see
[Jun 13-11 12:52:45]Nulvect <fighter> actually I don't think berserker has any specific blunt weapon abilities
[Jun 13-11 12:53:19]Nulvect <fighter> charge and rush can both be done with blunt
[Jun 13-11 12:54:28]Enska <fighter> i've noticed that it comes in different color when you rush with other weapons
[Jun 13-11 12:54:46]Nulvect <fighter> each weapon type has its own color
[Jun 15-11 22:38:16]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^woot 1 more dex!

[Sep 19-11 22:55:41]Yang <fighter> lvl 50 abil pls
[Oct 20-11 1:21:27]Tai <fighter> Sopboo pwns askjeeves.com
[Oct 20-11 1:21:35]Sopboo <fighter> lol
[Oct 20-11 1:53:19]Tai <fighter> do pallys have any blunt moves yet?
[Nov 1-11 13:34:3]Ying <fighter> do berserkers have blunt abils yet?
[Nov 1-11 13:34:15]Ying <fighter> or just still melee and axe?
[Nov 1-11 15:18:24]Ying <fighter> so melee for zerkers get 20 more than their weapon, BUT at higher lvls axes are the way to go because they have the better abilities, you can double wield them and they have a higher wc then knuckles/spiked gloves
[Nov 1-11 15:18:41]Ying <fighter> choices choices choices
[Nov 3-11 16:10:5]Nulvect <fighter> I'm making a quick change to rage, you berserkers should avoid using it for a couple minutes
[Nov 3-11 16:15:5]Nulvect <fighter> ok, you can now use lines during rage
[Nov 3-11 16:36:51]Ying <fighter> ooo
[Nov 7-11 15:41:55]Yinn <fighter> its funny when i rage and its a low sp it says You are too tired but i still go into rage
[Nov 7-11 15:47:44]Nulvect <fighter> possibly you are trying to slash or something right after rage starts and don't have the sp for it, though I thought I fixed that
[Nov 7-11 15:52:22]Nulvect <fighter> should be fixed now
[Nov 7-11 19:13:37]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^

[Nov 8-11 13:29:8]Demitri <fighter> any tips on how not to die tho?
[Nov 8-11 13:29:21]Demitri <fighter> lol my other char was a zerker for a week and died like 4 times
[Nov 8-11 13:40:51]Nulvect <fighter> try uh... eating food and stuff maybe
[Nov 9-11 19:2:42]Demitri <fighter> man i need some rings that increase crit dmg
[Nov 11-11 15:59:59]Ying <fighter> i say warriors should be able to warblade with any type of weapon, considering they are masters of weapons, or even hack with a sword or slash with a whip
[Nov 12-11 3:16:37]Nulvect <fighter> berserkers can now also use 'last' during rage :P
[Nov 15-11 22:5:42]<fighter> Ying zerkers pwn warriors
[Nov 16-11 14:46:22]Ying <fighter> something familiar
[Nov 16-11 14:51:46]Ying <fighter> rage buster
[Nov 16-11 20:34:25]Nulvect <fighter> ???
[Nov 17-11 14:55:48]Ying <fighter> hey Nul lemme double wield a 4 headed axe and a giant sword... plz....
[Nov 20-11 2:49:31]Ying <fighter> zerker need more blunt moves... did i say that already?
[Nov 20-11 2:49:39]Ying <fighter> hehe cant remember
[Nov 20-11 19:59:4]Ying <fighter> soooo Nul, we have to talk about ths compare thing

[Dec 1-11 1:57:32]Tai <fighter> i think rage may be 15... doh
[Dec 2-11 0:59:15]Tai <fighter> idea, brass knuckles be double wield not single wield for extra round 2
[Dec 2-11 1:11:40]Nulvect <fighter> they aren't wielded, they're just worn
[Dec 2-11 1:11:58]Tai <fighter> awwwww okie

[Jan 2-12 23:18:43]Vian <fighter> i'm no one
[Jan 3-12 21:45:32]Larry <fighter> str matter as much as dex for slash/warblade/
[Jan 4-12 23:27:6]Larry <fighter> also, does dex effect slash and warblade more then str?
[Jan 4-12 23:27:39]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^yeah helps more imo
[Jan 4-12 23:27:54]Larry <fighter> nice, am maken a dex base berserker
[Jan 4-12 23:28:35]Larry <fighter> i think 1k hp might not be enough for rhondale rage though
[Jan 5-12 2:37:14]Ying <fighter> boo
[Jan 5-12 15:17:18]Markosis <fighter> ? you idling? lol
[Jan 5-12 15:17:40]Vian <fighter> Not idling, just ignoring you.
[Jan 5-12 15:17:47]Markosis <fighter> ... why?
[Jan 5-12 15:18:0]Markosis <fighter> i guess everyone on muds are @!!! heads
[Jan 5-12 15:18:6]Vian <fighter> I'm busy looking for a girlfriend (not a fat one).
[Jan 5-12 15:18:12]Vian <fighter> Oh wait!  I'm probably #@!##!@ men.
[Jan 5-12 15:19:42]Markosis <fighter> ur such a prick :P
[Jan 28-12 3:6:19]Scoff <fighter> paladins been worked on?
[Jan 28-12 3:6:39]Scoff <fighter> i have noticed that they aint on ur list of classes to do is all
[Jan 28-12 3:12:4]Nulvect <fighter> no not really
[Jan 28-12 3:12:27]Scoff <fighter> ah ok
[Feb 9-12 3:35:0]Scoff <fighter> Nulect, do Palain/Antipaladin/ranger weapons scale on their skill levels?
[Feb 9-12 3:36:36]Nulvect <fighter> yep
[Feb 9-12 3:36:44]Scoff <fighter> humm ok
[Feb 9-12 3:36:50]Scoff <fighter> but there is a cap?
[Feb 9-12 3:36:57]Nulvect <fighter> that's why pal/anti weapons have different names as you get bigger heh
[Feb 9-12 3:37:22]Scoff <fighter> oh i was aware of that, i was just wondering if they capped at say lvl50 or somthing
[Feb 9-12 3:37:37]Scoff <fighter> or if they contiuned to grow as the fighter type did
[Feb 9-12 3:38:6]Nulvect <fighter> depends on the spell/abil
[Feb 9-12 3:38:11]Scoff <fighter> humm
[Feb 9-12 3:38:27]Scoff <fighter> so say my mysticblade might cap but my bless continues to grow?
[Feb 9-12 3:39:15]Scoff <fighter> i was just talking about it with Sopboo, as well as wondering about necromancers who can also make weapons
[Feb 9-12 3:40:32]Nulvect <fighter> right now most of them are capped (higher than most weapons though)
[Feb 9-12 3:40:55]Scoff <fighter> ahh ok, cool. we were just wondering about it is all.
[Feb 9-12 3:41:25]Scoff <fighter> ive a question, antipally weapons cant be wielded by any one but the summoner right?
[Feb 9-12 3:42:5]Scoff <fighter> cause others can wield pally weapons
[Feb 9-12 3:42:27]Nulvect <fighter> I dunno, I'd have to look... that sounds right though
[Feb 9-12 3:42:45]Scoff <fighter> ah ok, sweet as
[Feb 9-12 16:16:22]Sopboo <fighter> i know i can drop it
[Feb 9-12 16:16:27]Sopboo <fighter> so i assume you could wield
[Feb 9-12 16:16:53]Sopboo <fighter> just most spells abills for anti are self only like bloodlust and boost and stuff
[Mar 3-12 1:27:46]Nulvect <fighter> new spell help out at all, scoff??
[Mar 4-12 1:46:10]Yang <fighter> :(

[Mar 4-12 1:51:25]Nulvect <fighter> I still have their big new ability about... half done
[Mar 4-12 1:51:32]Yang <fighter> sweet
[Mar 4-12 1:51:47]Nulvect <fighter> but it's -big-, like several normal abilities in one
[Mar 4-12 1:51:59]Yang <fighter> uh oh
[Mar 4-12 1:52:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^like i prob gonna have to lvl again big :P
[Mar 4-12 1:53:12]Nulvect <fighter> no, as in it will take quite a while to finish and test when it's done, because it's about 5 times as much code
[Mar 4-12 1:53:32]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^wow
[Mar 4-12 1:53:36]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^awesome
[Mar 4-12 1:53:47]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^better start working on this char then huh
[Mar 4-12 1:54:2]Nulvect <fighter> I think I explained it before... it's going to combine basic weapon attacks together to make unique attacks
[Mar 4-12 1:54:19]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe ya i remember talking to you about it
[Mar 4-12 1:54:34]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^the combo thing
[Mar 4-12 1:54:41]Nulvect <fighter> entangle and gash will be removed once it gets put in
[Mar 4-12 1:54:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kool
[Mar 4-12 1:55:28]Nulvect <fighter> after that, I actually only have two more abilities on my idea list: a defensive combo ability and a finisher
[Mar 4-12 1:56:34]Nulvect <fighter> I think the big one can have enough different combinations of attacks to keep you busy... but if you have any ideas for other interesting stuff... keep me posted
[Mar 4-12 1:56:52]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^kool
[Mar 4-12 1:57:15]Yang <fighter> %^ORANGE%^<Warrior> %^WHITE%^hehe i know i spammed the fighter or warrior boards before about my ideas :P

[Jul 11-12 20:48:1]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ i think zerkers melee needs to be tweeked, I get more melee per lvl vs axe but wc makes me kill stuff faster in rage
[Jul 11-12 20:48:51]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ or maybe 2 melee hits for 2 armed ppl and 3 for 3 armed and so on and so on
[Jul 11-12 20:49:15]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ just my 2 cents
[Jul 11-12 21:34:18]Yinn <fighter> %^RED%^<RAGE> %^WHITE%^ what if in rage you get a kool melee abil :P
