[31-06 18:44:29]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ not sure
[31-06 18:44:35]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ but it causes some wierd errors
[1-06 20:43:7]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ BOO!
[1-06 20:43:43]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ thats a function
[1-06 20:44:9]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ int query_autoload I think
[1-06 20:45:11]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ query_autoload should be in the help file for armours and weapons
[1-06 20:45:53]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ shh NS :P

[1-06 20:51:43]Whit %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Doesnt matter as long as the #ifdef and #define are the same
[1-06 20:53:25]Whit %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Yes and no
[1-06 20:54:21]Whit %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ The concept is basically, if not defined __BLAH_H_ then define __BLAH_H and do a bunch of other defines, then #endif.  So, if __BLAH_H_ is already defined, it doesnt try to re-define causing errors
[1-06 21:3:5]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ 0_0

[Feb 9-06 18:50:52]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I can see it from overe on the player port
[Feb 9-06 18:51:10]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok, have fun, I'll be around
[Feb 9-06 19:6:0]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ negative
[Feb 9-06 19:6:24]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ aye
[Feb 9-06 20:34:3]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ negative
[Feb 9-06 21:57:47]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ fascinating. ^_-
[Feb 13-06 15:30:58]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ i have the flu, wont be doing much
[Feb 15-06 17:14:25]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Silly penguins
[Feb 15-06 17:15:33]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ The only way I could do it would be one file at a time, ed, copy/paste
[Feb 15-06 17:16:7]%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nesoo shrugs
[Feb 15-06 17:16:17]%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Whit smack!
[Feb 15-06 17:16:23]Whit %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Better than SPAM
[Feb 15-06 18:13:54]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Sorry, better, yeah, worded a little awkwardly though
[Feb 15-06 18:14:30]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ "It is seen" is just awkward
[Feb 15-06 18:15:48]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Much
[Feb 15-06 18:17:22]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hehe, np
[Feb 15-06 18:29:58]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ You hoo, over here :P
[Feb 15-06 18:30:14]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nevermind, heh
[Feb 15-06 18:31:24]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Yeah, you weren't answering, so I thought you were on builders instead of PD2
[Feb 15-06 18:36:58]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Well, since you use notepad to do everything, I suggest making a new file, and trying to use the format I have in /tmp/nest_if.c
[Feb 15-06 18:37:48]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Let me know when you have it done, then if ya got it done right, you can put it in your room code :)
[Feb 15-06 18:41:0]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Arma wants you
[Feb 15-06 18:47:20]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Hehe, wouldn't want to do it that way... because every # is > 0, so it would do the first one and stop there
[Feb 15-06 18:47:42]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and don't need the int x, that was just for my example, so x would make sense
[Feb 15-06 18:49:18]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ AFK a few
[Feb 15-06 18:51:56]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ back
[Feb 15-06 18:57:28]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hehe, no, though you should take that out as it serves no purpose
[Feb 15-06 18:58:16]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ The problem is that the first if() says if( [Dex] > 0 ) {-sp}... and EVERY value of Dex will be > 0, so that one is the ONLY one that will ever go off
[Feb 15-06 19:0:12]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ That's why my example starts with the highest number... and using x = 37 like in it, it will stop when it gets to if( x > 25 ), since it is less than 50, but greater than 25
[Feb 15-06 19:1:32]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ The other way to do it would be to keep what you had, but just use { this_player()->add_sp(-##); } for all the if()'s, and a return 0; at the end
[Feb 15-06 19:2:46]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok... just take your old code, and replace all the return 1;'s with return 0;'s, it'll acheive the same result.
[Feb 15-06 19:4:4]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Just use EXACLTY what you had before, and replace the 1's with 0's
[Feb 15-06 19:4:58]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Just use EXACLTY what you had before, and replace the 1's with 0's
[Feb 15-06 19:18:20]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I dunno, did you try changing one room first and testing it before changing all of them?
[Feb 15-06 19:20:8]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Giove me a few
[Feb 15-06 20:47:11]Nesoo %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ in a min
[Feb 16-06 14:54:17]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ sup?
[Feb 16-06 18:31:12]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ good
[Feb 16-06 18:31:20]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I'll look over it again when I get a chance
[Feb 16-06 18:31:26]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ good
[Feb 16-06 22:11:47]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what did you recover from?
[Feb 16-06 22:12:51]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well back in an hour
[Feb 17-06 10:28:31]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ daos didn't give me a report, so I have to talk with him
[Feb 17-06 10:29:7]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't get too excited though, whit hasn't gotten any system up yet to move things between the 2 ports
[Feb 17-06 10:30:29]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no, I didn't fix it
[Feb 17-06 10:30:39]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ my first instinct was to just take it out :P
[Feb 17-06 10:30:53]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ but I thought I'd give you a chance to fix it
[Feb 17-06 10:30:57]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and I want you to fix it
[Feb 17-06 10:31:7]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you need to pull out your math book
[Feb 17-06 10:31:29]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ cause you need to make sure that it only can special 12% of the time
[Feb 17-06 10:32:33]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nope
[Feb 17-06 10:32:41]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just have to use the random function and checks right
[Feb 17-06 10:32:55]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ correct
[Feb 17-06 10:33:15]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nope
[Feb 17-06 10:33:27]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ there were still many problems in that special code
[Feb 17-06 10:35:39]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I doubt it is over there
[Feb 17-06 10:35:59]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I can't even find it over here anymore
[Feb 17-06 10:36:5]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ amun, one last thing
[Feb 17-06 10:37:51]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ after looking at that weapon special code, I don't believe you understand even the basics of the coding process, which is fine, I don't expect builders to be good coders. But we can not be over there helping you all the time with the most simple of coding errors. So, I suggest reading some of NS's docs on how LPC works, and perhaps you'll end up needing our help less if you understand whats going on when you write certain code
[Feb 17-06 10:39:19]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ let me grab the folder
[Feb 17-06 10:39:25]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just read it at your leasure
[Feb 17-06 20:52:25]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Err?
[Feb 17-06 20:52:49]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I swear it is not my day
[Feb 18-06 0:6:49]Whit %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ?
[Feb 19-06 21:8:20]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ is it ok if I answer?
[Feb 19-06 21:8:42]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ set_no_clean is when the room resets it will not destruct the object
[Feb 19-06 21:9:54]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ for the storage room not the actual shop
[Feb 19-06 21:20:47]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ are you doing this for the storage room?
[Feb 19-06 21:30:1]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you define the type of shop in the shopkeeper
[Feb 19-06 21:30:25]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the way you had it was right, but it will not go in the room
[Feb 19-06 21:30:31]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you put it in the mob for the shop
[Feb 19-06 21:30:45]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ make sure you inherit "/std/vendor";
[Feb 19-06 21:30:59]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hopefully that helps you out
[Feb 19-06 21:31:27]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok, then all you need to do is add the set_type and it will be done
[Feb 20-06 10:6:56]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ test
[Feb 20-06 19:31:4]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nope
[Feb 20-06 19:32:16]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ The ones that were there when I looked recently, within the last few hours... they both said something like "you can sell ___ here for money. Soandso has put up a sign.
[Feb 20-06 19:33:0]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I wasn't being exact :P
[Feb 20-06 19:34:12]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Maybe it was "people come here to sell ____ for money. <shopkeeper's name> has hung a sign on the wall." somethin along those lines
[Feb 20-06 19:34:52]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Yeah, they both say that, but with different things that are sold, and a different person's name.
[Feb 20-06 19:45:39]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ You ok over there?
[Feb 20-06 21:6:21]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hm?
[Feb 20-06 21:6:45]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you didn't ask :P
[Feb 20-06 21:6:51]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Err?
[Feb 20-06 21:7:7]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ actually, no i didn't :P
[Feb 20-06 21:7:26]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I didn't make the connection until I saw one walk away, and I checked to see how you coded it
[Feb 20-06 21:7:38]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ cause the way you have it set up will spawn untold amounts of them
[Feb 20-06 21:9:46]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Oh, did you just do if( !present() ) instead of sizeof(children()) ?
[Feb 20-06 21:10:0]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Oh
[Feb 20-06 21:10:24]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Oh well, have fun with that, I'm out, really tired since I've been up since 2 AM :P
[Feb 20-06 21:10:54]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ bad news?
[Feb 20-06 21:12:12]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Ok I just logged on, sorry
[Feb 21-06 18:1:38]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hm?
[Feb 21-06 22:52:34]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ aye
[Feb 22-06 18:19:42]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Feb 22-06 18:19:50]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ not off the top of my head
[Feb 22-06 18:19:56]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ daos said he was done with the marshes
[Feb 22-06 18:20:20]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so now you just have to wait for him to go over the other 2 areas
[Feb 22-06 18:20:38]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I suggest you start planning you're next area until he can finish going over it
[Feb 22-06 18:21:8]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok
[Feb 22-06 18:21:48]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I can just tell you
[Feb 22-06 18:21:52]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nothing that special
[Feb 22-06 18:22:4]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I pretty much cut all your values in half
[Feb 22-06 18:22:22]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and lowered all your ac's and wc's to comform to my concept of balance
[Feb 22-06 18:22:42]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I pretty much have an idea in my head of what ac's and wc's should be
[Feb 22-06 18:22:51]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so I go over all new areas and make them comform
[Feb 22-06 18:23:0]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ not with your values you didn't
[Feb 22-06 18:23:12]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I noticed you almost always going at the max values
[Feb 22-06 18:23:52]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ thats not how it is supposed to work
[Feb 22-06 18:24:10]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the higher ranges should be reserved for rare items, not just items for higher levels
[Feb 22-06 18:24:48]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and with the values
[Feb 22-06 18:24:54]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you really need to look at the item itself
[Feb 22-06 18:25:8]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if it is made of wood, and is common, it should be cheap
[Feb 22-06 18:25:16]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if it is rare, the price goes up
[Feb 22-06 18:25:24]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ or if it is made of gold the price goes up
[Feb 22-06 21:40:11]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yar
[Feb 22-06 21:44:33]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ not atm
[Feb 22-06 21:44:35]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ in a few
[Feb 22-06 22:56:24]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ give me a minute ironman, have a download going so the connection is slow

[Feb 23-06 17:23:12]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well if you do have any questions, I'm not terribly busy
[Feb 23-06 17:24:54]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ not that I know of
[Feb 23-06 17:25:11]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I told daos to make going over your last two areas a priority
[Feb 24-06 14:44:43]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ aye
[Feb 24-06 17:26:27]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hm?
[Feb 24-06 17:27:1]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ahh
[Feb 24-06 17:27:39]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ he must be waiting than
[Feb 24-06 18:22:48]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I wouldn't have a clue
[Feb 24-06 18:23:36]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I guess I don't see it as an issue
[Feb 24-06 19:16:0]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I don't see what the hell the problem is
[Feb 24-06 19:16:48]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ mis
[Feb 24-06 19:17:8]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't mind him :P
[Feb 24-06 19:17:8]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ he likes to misline :P
[Feb 24-06 21:13:14]Whit %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ sup?
[Feb 25-06 21:17:27]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ of course :P
[Feb 25-06 21:18:17]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no :P
[Feb 25-06 21:18:39]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ because I wouldn't have the slightest clue how to do it
[Feb 25-06 21:19:41]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ a system level command isn't exacttly something that can easily be coded
[Feb 25-06 21:21:25]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what if you copy the line from the buffer, go to that line, and paste the code...
[Feb 25-06 21:22:17]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you can copy/paste from your client
[Feb 25-06 21:22:23]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and still use ed ironman
[Feb 25-06 21:22:39]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ there is your first problem, get mushclient or zmud
[Feb 25-06 21:22:43]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ :P
[Feb 25-06 21:24:19]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I don't know if whit is going to want to code a system level command
[Feb 25-06 21:25:9]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ which is why I suggested a workaround to the problem
[Feb 25-06 21:26:53]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah, I will be right over
[Feb 26-06 23:28:11]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ daos? where!

[Mar 1-06 1:9:33]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I was somehow thinking that
[Mar 1-06 1:9:35]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ :P
[Mar 1-06 1:9:47]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ have I ever lied?
[Mar 1-06 1:9:49]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well, don't answer that
[Mar 1-06 1:12:43]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ 1

[Mar 1-06 1:16:3]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that is what my mom said,  you need to smile
[Mar 1-06 1:17:1]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ they appear equal
[Mar 1-06 1:17:11]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ when I did the compare
[Mar 1-06 1:17:23]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ maybe the ac was changed
[Mar 1-06 1:17:36]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ or the syntax you used
[Mar 1-06 1:17:57]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it is compare earrings to earrings
[Mar 1-06 1:18:41]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok, same result
[Mar 1-06 1:18:43]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ they appear equal.
[Mar 1-06 1:19:7]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I'd appreciate if you didn't use my name all over the pd line
[Mar 1-06 1:19:43]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ for one, not everyone needs to know my name and I would tell them if they asked
[Mar 1-06 1:20:17]%^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Daos nods

[Mar 1-06 1:34:57]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ sorry, just wanted you to have the right spelling
[Mar 1-06 1:35:23]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ clergy would use a blunt
[Mar 1-06 1:35:33]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ or mages
[Mar 1-06 1:35:51]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't apologize,  I don't have to be so anal all the time :P
[Mar 1-06 1:37:19]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ good idea
[Mar 1-06 1:39:7]%^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Daos nods
[Mar 1-06 1:39:31]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't understand your question
[Mar 1-06 1:45:13]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ which weapon specials?
[Mar 1-06 2:17:16]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I hate that feeling, where you can feel your heartbeat in your arm or in your back

[Mar 1-06 3:0:0]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't know what is causing this
[Mar 1-06 3:12:26]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ currently experiencing extreme call volume due to a system outage
[Mar 1-06 4:14:4]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you use set_spells for abils/spells
[Mar 1-06 4:14:38]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yes
[Mar 1-06 4:14:52]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ also might want to set_spell_chance that it will go off
[Mar 1-06 4:15:28]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yes, but we don't have a set_abilities
[Mar 1-06 4:24:0]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ *nod*
[Mar 2-06 18:37:6]Azire %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nope, sorry

[Mar 3-06 9:29:53]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I'll take a look in a bit
[Mar 4-06 20:9:39]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I have about 0 time, but I'll swing by
[Mar 5-06 17:52:2]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hm?
[Mar 7-06 14:17:22]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ use this line please :P
[Mar 7-06 15:10:34]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok

[Mar 7-06 15:13:0]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ we shall see :P
[Mar 7-06 15:13:58]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok, it shouldn't have a pagan temple
[Mar 7-06 15:14:8]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ or a graveyard
[Mar 7-06 15:14:16]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's not appropriate for the area
[Mar 7-06 15:14:50]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ forests are also inproper
[Mar 7-06 15:14:58]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ this is a place in the clouds
[Mar 7-06 15:15:6]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I don't imagine a forest being there
[Mar 7-06 15:15:20]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that would be fine
[Mar 7-06 15:16:4]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ *Sigh* perhaps you shouldn't just pull stuff in and out to match my criteria
[Mar 7-06 15:16:44]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't just remve the forest and replace it with something else
[Mar 7-06 15:17:20]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ to me it doesn't make sense
[Mar 7-06 15:17:42]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you are missing my point
[Mar 7-06 15:18:20]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ my point is don't just plug in things. Your area should reflect some sort of thought in design
[Mar 7-06 15:18:54]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I don't think you do
[Mar 7-06 15:19:2]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ let me see how I can say it
[Mar 7-06 15:19:50]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I am just seeing you creating an area without giving much thought to how a city might be layed out
[Mar 7-06 15:20:46]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ again, you are not getting what I am trying to say
[Mar 7-06 15:21:8]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no, you don't amun
[Mar 7-06 15:21:14]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ your missing it entirely
[Mar 7-06 15:25:56]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I did not insult you, I was trying to explain my meaning, and you were not getting my meaning
[Mar 7-06 15:26:2]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and you were not giving me the chance to try
[Mar 7-06 15:26:30]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ anyway, I'm off.
[Mar 7-06 16:11:10]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nope
[Mar 7-06 16:11:42]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Indeed he does :P
[Mar 7-06 16:12:0]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah :P
[Mar 7-06 16:12:54]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Sure, just send it to me on the player side
[Mar 7-06 16:13:42]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Err?
[Mar 7-06 16:13:56]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Is it an actual item?
[Mar 7-06 17:10:48]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ than turn it off
[Mar 7-06 17:12:14]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ did you send me a new map?
[Mar 7-06 17:12:56]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I didn't get it
[Mar 7-06 17:13:26]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Yeah, I had to turn off newbie over there too, really annoying
[Mar 7-06 17:15:36]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok got it
[Mar 7-06 17:15:52]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you can start production, but remember. I'll be keeping a close eye on it
[Mar 7-06 17:16:16]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nod nod
[Mar 7-06 17:16:36]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ strip poker!
[Mar 7-06 17:16:38]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I don't think a game would fit this area
[Mar 7-06 17:16:56]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it is a place people go to contemplate and meditate
[Mar 7-06 17:17:4]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ gaming would run against that idea
[Mar 7-06 17:17:17]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yes, but there will be restrictions
[Mar 7-06 17:17:50]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no
[Mar 7-06 17:18:0]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just label it as such
[Mar 7-06 17:18:12]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and I will instruct you on what I want
[Mar 7-06 17:18:42]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no, I've been busy
[Mar 7-06 17:18:52]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Just inherit OIL or inherit STONE
[Mar 7-06 17:19:24]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and when I get it done, inherit OINTMENT
[Mar 7-06 17:19:30]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and I know you want elite
[Mar 7-06 17:21:18]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ how big is it?
[Mar 7-06 17:23:46]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Just go with the inherits, I have an idea for oil, ointment, and stones, that allows the basic ones to be elite
[Mar 7-06 17:24:36]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ You're going to have to recode your guild ointment once I get an inherit for them cooked up
[Mar 7-06 17:25:8]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ You'll just need to call set_elite(1); or something similar in create()
[Mar 7-06 17:26:4]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Hehe, you could still code them, it would just be a matter of adding 1 line to them later :)
[Mar 7-06 17:26:16]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I would wait on the ointment though :)
[Mar 7-06 19:57:22]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ BOO
[Mar 7-06 19:57:54]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ NS!
[Mar 7-06 19:58:8]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just admit it, I scared you
[Mar 7-06 19:58:32]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ LOL
[Mar 7-06 19:58:36]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that works for me :P
[Mar 7-06 19:59:30]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so how goes things?
[Mar 7-06 20:0:8]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ aye
[Mar 7-06 20:0:20]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hehe, I keep getting distracted myself
[Mar 7-06 20:0:34]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ finished up the remake of wizard, and now I'm on druid
[Mar 7-06 20:1:22]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ my new wizard seems to be a success
[Mar 7-06 20:1:42]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ all new attack and defensive spells
[Mar 7-06 20:1:56]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ on a whole new balance daemon
[Mar 7-06 20:6:53]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well, I just split the physical and magic attacks, otherwise it is ver similar
[Mar 7-06 20:7:7]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ oh
[Mar 7-06 20:7:23]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I also made fighter attacks far more based on stats
[Mar 7-06 20:7:27]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and mages on skills
[Mar 7-06 20:8:7]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Heh, you tell him that we're testing a new xp curve now too
[Mar 7-06 20:8:37]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I can mail you the daemon if you like
[Mar 7-06 20:9:1]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nod nod
[Mar 7-06 20:9:13]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so far it seems to be working
[Mar 7-06 20:9:21]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ lol, not sure this is much better, but it's based off of a comparison of the attacker's level and the target's level, and it scales on a percent basis... got a range where you get 100%, then it drops off to 50%, and anything lower than that is 0
[Mar 7-06 20:9:49]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Err, not a solid drop from 100-50%, but more like a curve
[Mar 7-06 20:10:15]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yah
[Mar 7-06 20:10:31]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's the only way to keep higher level players out of the lower level zones
[Mar 7-06 20:11:43]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Oh, are you alone over there?
[Mar 7-06 20:11:59]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Just realized I prolly shouldn't be talking specifics of it if palyers are there
[Mar 7-06 20:12:13]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ aye, it does
[Mar 7-06 20:12:31]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Ahh
[Mar 7-06 20:12:43]Daboura %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ makes us over here look nuts, but tbhats ok :P
[Mar 7-06 20:12:49]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ You see nothing, people!
[Mar 7-06 20:12:55]Nesoo %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ There was no

[Jul 3-06 3:41:24]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ this work?
[Jul 4-06 18:7:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ right now we're in bug fix mode on the main port
[Jul 9-06 22:56:15]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ test
[Jul 11-06 14:24:48]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ah, that is what DEV-MUD is
[Jul 11-06 14:25:10]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ cool, so that is where you hiding... is this a one way line?
[Jul 11-06 14:25:54]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ DEV-MUD is not that lame, I came up with DSMud, and was not able to think of a name so took if off dead souls and made it DS :P
[Jul 11-06 14:28:38]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah, true
[Jul 11-06 14:29:6]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ how long have you been working on DEV-MUD?
[Jul 11-06 14:29:38]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ made any progress?
[Jul 11-06 14:30:8]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ combat? :P
[Jul 11-06 14:30:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what lib are you using??
[Jul 11-06 14:30:38]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ah
[Jul 11-06 14:31:32]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the user.c was a huge file and hacks thrown in it all over
[Jul 11-06 14:32:8]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ going to have a classless mud?
[Jul 11-06 14:32:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ pd's lib is so... dirty
[Jul 11-06 14:32:40]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ interesting, if done right that can be fun
[Jul 11-06 14:33:38]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ are you still going to keep races in?
[Jul 11-06 14:34:18]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ we are going with a 6 stat d&d system
[Jul 11-06 14:34:44]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hola
[Jul 11-06 14:35:30]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hows your project going?
[Jul 11-06 14:35:48]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ heh
[Jul 11-06 14:36:26]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ gonna email you this eveing if I get time
[Jul 11-06 14:36:50]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ heh, I know how you feel =P
[Jul 11-06 14:37:30]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ anyhow, I am off to take the boy to drivers ed
[Jul 11-06 14:38:52]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm, a combat system that used chain attacks would be interesting, the more attacks you link, the more damage
[Jul 11-06 14:39:10]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ *nod*
[Jul 11-06 14:40:32]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ we have not even thought about classes, planned out 21 races, 5 that can only be acquired through a special quest
[Jul 11-06 14:42:0]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the problem is keeping the quests secret, once everyone knows it has to be redone
[Jul 11-06 14:43:4]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm, that sounds like a headache in the long run
[Jul 11-06 14:43:54]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well, quest races would not be true to d&d too
[Jul 11-06 14:44:44]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I like the d&d system actually
[Jul 11-06 14:44:50]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ be interesting to make a mud true to that system
[Jul 11-06 14:45:54]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I've also thought about character customization
[Jul 11-06 14:46:18]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ beyond the pick a name, select your race, log on the mud
[Jul 11-06 14:47:30]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ one system that players enjoy if it's balanced is a sphere based magic system
[Jul 11-06 14:48:12]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so a player does not have to learn magic missile, they might choose the sphere of fire and learn fireblast
[Jul 11-06 14:49:2]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ character portraits would be fun, they would get a kick out of watching their character change as they modify features
[Jul 11-06 14:50:20]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ there is a lot of great ideas, it's finding the time to code them
[Jul 11-06 14:51:30]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you are a lib coder, so anything you think up wouldn't be too hard for you to code :)
[Jul 11-06 14:52:12]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the only limit you have is whether or not it will work in the theme of your mud
[Jul 11-06 14:52:50]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah, that is important too :P
[Jul 11-06 14:53:10]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ are you passing your ideas by anyone?
[Jul 11-06 14:55:0]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ *nod*
[Jul 11-06 14:58:18]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ going to have to see it in a year or two when you open :)
[Jul 11-06 14:59:6]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ heh you guys are funny
[Jul 11-06 14:59:28]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yes, some ideas are top secret ;)
[Jul 11-06 14:59:34]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ =P
[Jul 11-06 15:0:22]%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Stormbringer only has one
[Jul 11-06 15:0:36]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so will this one, and it is not really my idea
[Jul 11-06 15:0:46]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it is whit'
[Jul 11-06 15:1:8]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't know why we never thought of it, but it is definately gonna change PD ;)
[Jul 11-06 15:1:28]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ probably for the worse, but you know how that goes =P
[Jul 11-06 15:1:48]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the better the ideas on your mud the worse the players seem to act =P
[Jul 11-06 15:17:12]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I really like this idea of staying true to d&d
[Jul 11-06 15:23:46]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that can open up a lawsuit as d&d is pretty popular
[Jul 11-06 15:24:6]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I'll have to think about it more as we get farther in development
[Jul 11-06 15:27:10]Stormbringer %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ heh
[Jul 11-06 15:27:46]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ *nod*
[Jul 11-06 15:27:50]Stormbringer %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well since PD has always been a refuge for players banished from other muds, kinda hard not to attract some riftraft =P
[Jul 11-06 15:28:12]Stormbringer %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ tis ok
[Jul 11-06 15:28:14]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I will be back later
[Jul 11-06 15:28:22]Stormbringer %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ my wife will run em all off

[Jul 14-06 0:45:34]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nice
[Jul 14-06 0:45:51]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ascii mapmaker doesn't allow you to add text?
[Jul 14-06 0:46:1]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ labels think they are called
[Jul 14-06 0:46:37]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ heh
[Jul 14-06 0:49:9]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ /domains/include is locked?
[Jul 14-06 0:49:19]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ err, /include/domains
[Jul 14-06 0:50:17]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ didn't think it was
[Jul 20-06 16:44:34]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I did a remove living on your char
[Jul 20-06 16:44:44]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hey line stopped bugging

[Jul 20-06 16:47:5]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ can't

[Jul 20-06 16:48:9]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I would recommend deleting that whole object daos :P
[Jul 20-06 16:48:15]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it just keeps causing problems
[Jul 20-06 16:51:5]Stormbringer %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what object do you have on you?
[Jul 20-06 16:51:21]Stormbringer %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it won't le me kick you off

[Jul 20-06 16:51:47]Stormbringer %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just delete the object off him, if you know the name
[Jul 20-06 16:52:5]Stormbringer %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I have a bud report

[Jul 20-06 16:58:47]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and that caused that bug msg??
[Jul 20-06 16:59:11]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no, I don't think so. I did that about 30 seconds before the error
[Jul 20-06 16:59:55]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that line is in the id() function
[Jul 20-06 17:0:29]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ apparently something has an id that's a number??
[Jul 20-06 17:0:31]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ only box I know of is the board in a box
[Jul 20-06 17:1:9]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ should be, I removed living on you, he deleted your ring
[Jul 20-06 17:5:57]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Daos, I swaer
[Jul 20-06 17:6:27]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I dunno what the hell is going on
[Jul 20-06 17:6:39]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I dested my healing ring the second I logged on earlier and haven't touched it since
[Jul 20-06 17:7:5]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ let me see if I can restart the mud
[Jul 20-06 17:7:5]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that test ob I dunno what's going on with it if that's the prob
[Jul 20-06 17:7:25]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ delete that test obj.
[Jul 20-06 17:8:58]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that object deleted yet?
[Jul 20-06 17:9:10]%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods

[Jul 20-06 17:23:54]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ mud is back up, Daos, if that object autoloaded, you can't come back on till it is fixed =P
[Jul 20-06 17:24:8]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it didn't a/l and I deleted the file anyway

[Jul 20-06 17:25:56]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I think you are ok D
[Jul 23-06 16:37:0]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you should be able to use "home" too, but best to pick a race first
[Jul 23-06 16:39:12]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the "home" command should take you to your workroom
[Jul 23-06 16:39:40]Daos %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ let me create you a home dir first and copy workroom.c over
[Jul 23-06 16:40:4]Daos %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ now try the "home" command
[Jul 23-06 16:41:6]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ sorry, I'll let you take care of it daos, heh

[Jul 24-06 14:37:20]Whit %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I always used wall
[Jul 24-06 14:37:34]Whit %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Crt+D exits out of write
[Jul 24-06 14:37:46]Whit %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ lol
[Jul 24-06 14:37:52]Whit %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Its all good
[Jul 24-06 14:37:58]Whit %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I gotta get going anyway
[Jul 24-06 14:38:16]Whit %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ lol
[Jul 24-06 14:38:26]Whit %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I gotta go job hunting
[Jul 24-06 14:38:26]Whit %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Cya
[Jul 24-06 16:0:54]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you should use this line for that stuff
[Jul 24-06 16:1:26]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ set_spells( ({"slash", "bash"}) );
[Jul 24-06 16:1:32]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ set_spell_chance(50);
[Jul 24-06 16:1:46]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the number is a percentage possibility, 100 means they always use one
[Jul 24-06 16:2:16]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ all skills and stats for a mob are set when you do set_level, so if you want to change them from the defaults put those line after the set_level
[Jul 24-06 16:3:32]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ set_skill("attack", 100) or set_stats("strength",4) need to be after the set_level(35) line
[Jul 24-06 16:3:44]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the set_level will completely override anything you set before it
[Jul 24-06 16:4:58]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nod, but do keep in mind that currently newbies kill level 8-16 mobs
[Jul 24-06 16:5:16]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ k
[Jul 24-06 18:43:49]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hey
[Jul 24-06 18:44:51]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I don't know if the help files are right over there, but hm weapons are 6-13 and elite 10-16, so probably 9 or 10
[Jul 24-06 18:45:5]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ try "help balwep" and "help balarm"
[Jul 24-06 18:48:57]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I'm not sure
[Jul 24-06 18:49:13]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ read the board in the wizlounge, it might have something mentioned
[Jul 24-06 18:49:23]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and if it doesn't, you'd have to ask whit or daos
[Jul 24-06 18:49:41]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ type wizlounge
[Jul 24-06 18:58:25]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ set_spells() and set_spell_chance()
[Jul 24-06 18:58:41]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ set_spells takes an array of ability and spell names
[Jul 24-06 18:59:29]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no it's the same way
[Jul 24-06 18:59:41]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ({"slash","bash"}) is an array
[Jul 24-06 19:0:11]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ({}) enclose the array and you need another set of () for the function... so you had it right
[Jul 24-06 19:0:21]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ set_spells( ({"slash","bash"}) );
[Jul 24-06 19:1:31]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what error??
[Jul 24-06 19:1:39]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I'll come check it out
[Jul 24-06 19:12:17]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ still not working??
[Jul 24-06 19:13:49]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if it says there's an error on line X, you should check line X and the line before it and maybe even the whole block it's in
[Jul 24-06 19:54:59]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you call orc;force_me;"wear armour" does he wear it??
[Jul 24-06 22:56:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you can ask on this line trexia
[Jul 24-06 22:56:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you need any imms from here
[Jul 24-06 22:57:5]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hi trexia
[Jul 24-06 22:57:23]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ how are you doing?
[Jul 24-06 22:58:29]%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Jul 24-06 23:20:26]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's always nice when they are on
[Jul 24-06 23:42:18]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah, what is up?
[Jul 24-06 23:43:42]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ thanks, I will reboot it soon
[Jul 25-06 18:34:42]Luna %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ shush
[Jul 25-06 19:23:18]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ coding up a spell
[Jul 25-06 19:23:42]%^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Jul 25-06 20:29:1]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ int query_autoload() { if (whatever) return 1; }
[Jul 26-06 1:40:0]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ dirty??
[Jul 26-06 2:26:9]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if it's your file
[Jul 26-06 2:26:15]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ mv filename newfilename
[Jul 26-06 2:26:43]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you can also do cp filename newfilename
[Jul 27-06 1:39:1]A shadow %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ thanks :)
[Jul 27-06 1:39:27]A shadow %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah, newbies don't need to hear discussions on code ;)
[Jul 27-06 1:39:31]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ probably 0 or 1 for outdoor areas
[Jul 27-06 1:39:41]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ unless they're well-lit
[Jul 27-06 1:39:55]A shadow %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ 0 is total dark
[Jul 27-06 1:39:57]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ -5 is magically bright
[Jul 27-06 1:40:22]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I think the default is 2 or 3
[Jul 27-06 1:40:26]A shadow %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no
[Jul 27-06 1:40:50]A shadow %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ default is 1 for dark
[Jul 27-06 1:40:54]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ /doc/build/properties/light
[Jul 27-06 1:41:6]A shadow %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ is it night?

[Jul 27-06 1:43:24]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok :)
[Jul 27-06 1:44:55]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ night light 1 is light enough to see by
[Jul 27-06 1:51:45]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ not especially
[Jul 27-06 1:52:43]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't worry about anything like that, if that changes we'll take care of it
[Jul 27-06 1:59:54]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you want it to use spells and abilities, it needs a set_class and set_subclass
[Jul 27-06 2:0:47]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ descartes's docs were written in 93 or so for the unmodified nightmare lib, not everything is still applicable, especially regarding lfuns
[Jul 27-06 2:1:33]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that probably means something on the left side of a -> is not an object
[Jul 27-06 2:2:1]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ everything you code needs to include your header
[Jul 27-06 2:3:21]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no, you need new(WEAP+"/upper/froststaff") or you can leave out the + sign
[Jul 27-06 2:3:47]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and you do need it as /upper if WEAP is defined without a / on the end
[Jul 27-06 2:4:3]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the ->etc part is fine, the cloning part is what isn't working right
[Jul 27-06 2:6:16]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yes we will need your header
[Jul 27-06 2:7:14]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ heh, using ed...
[Jul 27-06 2:8:20]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm, do ed filename.c, 1,$d, a, ctrl+v
[Jul 27-06 2:8:28]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ., x
[Jul 27-06 2:8:36]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ 1,$d deletes the whole file though
[Jul 27-06 2:8:50]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I always just delete the entire file and copy/paste again nul
[Jul 27-06 2:9:18]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you type the line number to go to, then use i, it will push the test from that line down and add all your pasted text to that line
[Jul 27-06 2:9:24]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ #include "fiwupp.h"
[Jul 27-06 2:9:30]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you use a, it will place your pasted text AFTER the line you are on
[Jul 27-06 2:9:44]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah, but if you use 1,$d to empty the contents of the file
[Jul 27-06 2:9:54]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you can do a select all in your text editor and do a, ctrl+v
[Jul 27-06 2:10:0]%^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Jul 27-06 2:10:4]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that's probably easier
[Jul 27-06 2:11:12]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ oh, if you use the Z command in ed it displays 40 lines at a time, good for copying it back into your text editor
[Jul 27-06 2:11:58]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ we're going to have to write up an ed tutorial I think :P
[Jul 27-06 2:14:6]%^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nulvect shrugs
[Jul 27-06 2:14:20]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what file?
[Jul 27-06 2:14:22]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ will take a look
[Jul 27-06 2:23:38]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well, <> looks in a couple standard places for the file, "" looks relative to the dir the file is in
[Jul 27-06 2:25:14]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ best to use the <> way for includes
[Jul 27-06 2:25:20]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you have the ) on the next line though
[Jul 27-06 2:25:26]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ keep it all on one line
[Jul 27-06 2:26:38]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you #define ARM "/some/dir/", you use ARM just like a string variable
[Jul 27-06 2:26:56]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so: new(ARM+"frostplate.c"), don't put ARM inside the ""s
[Jul 27-06 2:31:10]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ before you start "inflating" hp, try loading them up without changing their hp and use stat mobname to see how much they normally have
[Jul 27-06 2:31:16]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it might be more than you think
[Jul 27-06 2:36:24]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ use n in ed to turn line numbering on
[Jul 27-06 2:36:28]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ also do a set save to save the settings
[Jul 27-06 2:48:54]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ new("path of mob")->move(this_object());
[Jul 27-06 2:50:50]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ooooh, set save... somehow never found out about that one
[Jul 27-06 2:52:30]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ check the tirun square code, it loads a guard up
[Jul 27-06 2:54:24]A shadow %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ parse error is usually on the line before
[Jul 27-06 2:56:48]A shadow %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nite
[Jul 27-06 2:57:58]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ skunks don't smell that bad
[Jul 27-06 2:58:18]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I used to live near a tallow plant, skunk is nothing compared to that
[Jul 27-06 14:14:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok...
[Jul 27-06 18:41:14]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you need help seras, this is the line to ask on
[Jul 27-06 23:14:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ skills screwed up??
[Jul 27-06 23:14:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just make sure the mob is set as a class/sub that can cast it normally and it'll be fine
[Jul 27-06 23:15:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ dunno what was up with that, stuff works fine for me over there
[Jul 27-06 23:18:8]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ call me;set_class;"mage"  then call me;set_subclass;"necromancer"   then you can do set_level and you need to set your magic skills too..
[Jul 27-06 23:18:56]%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nulvect shrugs
[Jul 27-06 23:25:2]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ this is the line to use for coding stuff seras
[Jul 28-06 0:24:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Jul 28-06 0:24:46]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm, one sec
[Jul 28-06 1:9:16]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hey trexia
[Jul 28-06 15:39:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I am sort of
[Jul 28-06 15:39:20]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ trying to talk to 25 people at once though, what do you need??
[Jul 28-06 18:1:30]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ dunno, probably changes
[Jul 28-06 18:2:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you can check the packs in the tirun shop to see what theirs is to get an idea
[Jul 28-06 21:19:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just select the text, type ed whatever.c, type a, and paste.. then type . and x to save it
[Jul 29-06 20:54:28]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Jul 29-06 20:54:40]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ isn't it similar to the pit?
[Jul 29-06 20:54:48]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I believe it is already done on this port
[Jul 29-06 20:55:2]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ummm
[Jul 29-06 20:55:14]Stormbringer %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ not real sure, I will check
[Jul 30-06 1:58:20]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ by the way trexia, if you're still over there, that is automatic here when you look at a container
[Jul 30-06 1:59:42]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nod, don't think anyone ported the code over there for it
[Jul 30-06 2:0:30]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah it's probably in the container code over here, so any container you make will have it
[Jul 30-06 2:2:52]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what is your question?
[Jul 30-06 2:13:46]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ can you not set up the header trexia?
[Jul 30-06 2:19:33]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you would have ROOMS+"workroom"
[Jul 30-06 2:20:9]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok, I need to take an aspirin
[Jul 30-06 2:23:25]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ um, quick note, you cannot use ROOM or any of the other things you inherit like WEAPON, ARMOUR, etc, or bad things will happen
[Jul 30-06 2:23:57]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ROOMS or WEAPONS work fine though
[Jul 30-06 2:29:43]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ stupid, no
[Jul 30-06 2:29:45]Stormbringer %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you do not use them, your stuff will not go in the game
[Jul 30-06 2:29:45]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ they are useful
[Jul 30-06 2:30:17]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and they make the job of moving areas over much easier
[Jul 30-06 2:30:23]Stormbringer %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ guaranteed, no one here will do the changes needed to get an area into the game without a header
[Jul 30-06 2:31:5]Stormbringer %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ k
[Aug 1-06 14:30:32]A shadow %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ i do
[Aug 1-06 14:31:8]A shadow %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nod
[Aug 1-06 14:32:8]A shadow %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ haven't heard so i really don't know
[Aug 1-06 23:10:21]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ?
[Aug 1-06 23:10:41]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hang on brt
[Aug 1-06 23:26:1]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what is the error?
[Aug 1-06 23:26:20]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ array index needs to be positive or zero
[Aug 1-06 23:26:22]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ have a second to take a look
[Aug 1-06 23:26:26]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what file?
[Aug 1-06 23:26:26]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ when you type calendar
[Aug 1-06 23:26:42]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ /dameon/events_d.c
[Aug 1-06 23:26:56]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that bug has been there for some time
[Aug 1-06 23:27:2]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ mailed whit on it too
[Aug 1-06 23:27:12]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ stormy said he would have to deal with it is that right?
[Aug 1-06 23:27:36]Luna %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ k, going to bed now
[Aug 3-06 2:6:54]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ heh, my day went by really fast
[Aug 3-06 2:7:58]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ waking, coding, watching my weekly anime, work, relaxing, and now more coding
[Aug 3-06 2:9:22]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ not really, generally takes about an hour
[Aug 3-06 2:9:24]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ heh
[Aug 3-06 2:9:28]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the waking, I mean
[Aug 3-06 2:10:0]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ my alarm first went off at 8:30 this morning, I finally got up around 9:40
[Aug 3-06 2:10:24]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I've hit snooze every 10 minutes for 3-4 hours straight before
[Aug 3-06 2:10:56]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ oh, I do, it just takes time to recalibrate
[Aug 26-06 15:3:52]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ who?
[Aug 26-06 15:4:2]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok, will be right over
[Aug 26-06 15:4:34]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Aug 26-06 16:7:12]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ for what??
[Aug 26-06 16:7:52]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ oh, no problem
[Aug 26-06 16:8:50]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yes??
[Aug 26-06 16:9:42]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's how to make commands usable.. they have to be in a dir which is in your search path
[Aug 26-06 16:10:2]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ when you log in, the mud automatically adds /wizards/amun/bin/ to your search path, if that dir exists
[Aug 26-06 16:10:38]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ can't do any testing otherwise
[Aug 30-06 0:1:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I'm not balance, but I would say it would have to be extremely rare, a single stat or skill, and not too much of a boost
[Aug 30-06 0:1:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ and last for maybe 1-2 minutes at most
[Aug 30-06 0:18:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ maybe 10 or so for stats, 50ish for skills, but yeah, you can try asking them
[Aug 30-06 0:20:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ random makes for an annoying trinket rather than something people would actually want
[Aug 30-06 0:22:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ all stats at once?? hmm, maybe
[Aug 30-06 0:24:36]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ sounds good
[Aug 30-06 0:24:58]%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Sep 4-06 3:0:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you can ask stuff on this line too by the way
[Sep 4-06 3:2:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ testing
[Sep 4-06 3:2:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Sep 13-06 13:0:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok
[Sep 13-06 13:0:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what's the question??
[Sep 13-06 13:2:1]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ah, ok
[Sep 13-06 13:2:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ will you be around friday morning, by the way??
[Sep 13-06 13:2:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ k, doesn't look like you read my mudmail over here, but I'll try to go over your area then
[Sep 13-06 13:3:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ since I'm not an admin on builders I need you to be there as well
[Sep 15-06 12:34:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ WOOHOO
[Sep 18-06 15:52:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Sep 18-06 15:53:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ never been a problem before, most help files here even tell you
[Sep 18-06 15:56:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the help files for each spell/abil
[Sep 18-06 16:1:28]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well I'm not posting up a full spell list for every sub anywhere where non-staff can see it
[Sep 22-06 16:13:18]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ k
[Sep 22-06 18:16:34]Luna %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hiya
[Sep 22-06 18:17:26]Luna %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ do i have to? ;)
[Sep 22-06 18:18:18]Luna %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ can it wait, fixin to go to dinner and just checking posts and such atm
[Sep 22-06 18:18:56]Luna %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ gimme a sec then
[Sep 22-06 18:23:34]Luna %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ gonna have to do this later, stormy wants me to leave now
[Sep 25-06 1:16:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeeep
[Sep 25-06 1:17:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ those new tutorials helping out at all??
[Sep 25-06 14:32:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ???
[Sep 29-06 12:19:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yep
[Sep 29-06 12:20:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ shoot
[Sep 29-06 12:21:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok...
[Sep 29-06 12:22:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ like "left slash"??
[Sep 29-06 12:23:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so the movement is inherent in the attack??
[Sep 29-06 12:24:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that doesn't make some things make sense though
[Sep 29-06 12:24:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ charge is a movement then an attack
[Sep 29-06 12:26:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok
[Sep 29-06 12:26:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ so where's the problem??
[Sep 29-06 12:28:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ah, I would do it like this then:
[Sep 29-06 12:28:27]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hiya guys!
[Sep 29-06 12:28:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ err, you might remember how stones work here
[Sep 29-06 12:28:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the first stone is the controller of the next two
[Sep 29-06 12:28:51]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nightshade it's me hep
[Sep 29-06 12:29:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I would set something up similarly in the heart_beat, probably based on dex, for which player is the controller and goes first, and his heart_beat would do everything itself
[Sep 29-06 12:30:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yep
[Sep 29-06 12:32:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm, one way to alleviate that would be to set a variable in everyone involved
[Sep 29-06 12:32:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ each heart_beat would have the same code to figure out who goes first
[Sep 29-06 12:32:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ then it would loop over everyone in combat and do like set_combat_controller(1/0)
[Sep 29-06 12:33:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ then all the other people involved could just check that variable instead of running the same code over again
[Sep 29-06 12:34:9]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yep
[Sep 29-06 12:34:35]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ but it any given group of combatants, it only happens once per round
[Sep 29-06 12:37:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if (in_combat) { if (combat_control) { do_attacks; do_moves; } else if (!controller_figured_out_already) { figure out controller; controller->set_combat_control(1); others->set_combat_control(0); } }
[Sep 29-06 12:38:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ in figure out controller;
[Sep 29-06 12:39:9]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ or you could just use three settings for the combat_control flag, 0 meaning it's not figured out yet and 1 and 2 for the others..
[Sep 29-06 12:39:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the heart_beat can reset everything after all that is done
[Sep 29-06 12:39:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Sep 29-06 12:39:45]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just reset it after the combat code
[Sep 29-06 12:41:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hb1: c's hb goes first, sets variables in b and a, sees it isn't controller, and resets his own variables - a goes, sees the variable c set, IS controller, runs attacks and moves, and resets a's vars - b goes, sees the variable c set, is NOT controller, and resets his own variables
[Sep 29-06 12:42:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ the variables being set are just for the reference of that one object they're being set in, the others don't actually query them
[Sep 29-06 12:46:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nod
[Sep 29-06 13:56:16]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ns, you still around??
[Sep 29-06 13:57:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ or anyone??
[Sep 29-06 14:4:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Sep 29-06 14:22:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ah, I think I figured it out
[Sep 29-06 14:22:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ trying to return an array of function pointers
[Sep 29-06 14:24:30]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ oh hey... recall what the problem was with the elemental system??
[Sep 29-06 14:24:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I remember someone telling me not to use it because it didn't work right
[Sep 29-06 17:22:13]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hi
[Oct 1-06 2:4:0]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what's that?
[Oct 3-06 13:39:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ k
[Oct 6-06 12:59:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ why are you using a tertiary operator for that??
[Oct 6-06 13:0:1]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ member_array(find_player("ironman"), users()) will return -1 if not found, otherwise it will return the array index for which member it is
[Oct 7-06 15:27:45]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ k
[Oct 7-06 15:27:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ probably going to be gone for the day in a sec
[Oct 7-06 15:29:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it seems ok, I'll look into it though
[Oct 7-06 15:32:42]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ dunno what kind of 25k mobs you fight, but in my test.. while naked.. I barely took 50 damage
[Oct 7-06 15:33:24]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ those aren't 25k mobs :P
[Oct 10-06 22:47:7]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what thing??
[Oct 10-06 22:47:15]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ haven't read them yet
[Oct 10-06 22:47:39]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ assuming you == carina
[Oct 10-06 22:48:9]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ "A shadow@Primal Darkness-II <pd> you didnt know i was carina?"
[Oct 10-06 22:48:33]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's just what the mud sends
[Oct 10-06 22:48:37]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hang on a sec
[Oct 11-06 14:40:16]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nah, that usuallyonly happens in the evenings
[Oct 11-06 14:40:21]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ working actually

[Oct 11-06 14:44:31]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ something I need to see or can you explain over this line?
[Oct 11-06 14:44:39]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok
[Oct 11-06 14:44:43]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ gimme a few

[Oct 11-06 14:47:24]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nod, sent him a mail. I will call this evening if he does not respond by then
[Oct 11-06 14:51:28]Stormbringer %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ on my way

[Oct 26-06 1:55:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ thanks
[Oct 26-06 1:56:5]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ gave me an error in /daemon/chat.c line 207, soon as I logged on, hope my char unbugs itself later on
[Oct 26-06 1:56:31]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ lol
[Oct 26-06 1:56:35]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Sorry, that was me
[Oct 26-06 1:56:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nod, figured you were working on chat daemon
[Oct 26-06 2:10:21]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ testing
[Oct 27-06 19:51:59]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ uh
[Oct 27-06 19:52:3]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ explain what you are trying to do??
[Oct 27-06 20:48:50]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yep
[Oct 27-06 21:20:34]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ooook
[Oct 27-06 21:30:19]Nulvect %^B_MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yep
[Oct 28-06 20:18:30]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yeah, have to grab some indian food first though, give me a few minutes
[Nov 6-06 13:13:53]Whit %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ You still over there Ironman?
[Nov 12-06 15:12:9]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ amun, you awake??
[Nov 12-06 15:14:29]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ blah
[Nov 23-06 1:57:13]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ deathgrip??
[Nov 23-06 1:58:7]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ don't remember anything about that
[Nov 23-06 2:0:41]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Nov 23-06 2:10:53]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ bah, I find myself with a glut of offensive necromancy spells
[Nov 23-06 2:12:53]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ too many attack spells
[Nov 23-06 2:26:43]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ estoy de acuerdo
[Nov 28-06 11:28:31]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you put it in the reset() func
[Nov 28-06 11:28:41]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ same way you load mobs
[Nov 28-06 11:29:33]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ um... oh... they have to search to find it or something??
[Nov 28-06 11:29:49]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ then you'd base it on a variable and reset that variable in reset()
[Nov 28-06 11:30:45]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ int foundboom;     youraddaction() { if (!foundboom) { give them one; } }     void reset() { ::reset(); loadmobs; foundboom=0; }
[Nov 28-06 11:36:11]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well you want something like if (!foundboom) { write("You search and find something."); new(blah blah); } else { write("You search but find nothing."); }
[Nov 28-06 11:41:49]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that is correct actually, I just forgot one thing... add foundboom=1; right after the new() line
[Nov 28-06 11:42:59]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yep
[Nov 28-06 11:44:7]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ add "int foundboom;" after your inherit line in the room
[Nov 28-06 11:45:58]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you have an existing reset() function just put foundboom=0; into it and delete that one you just made
[Nov 28-06 11:48:6]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that was just a shortcut I used, everything I type is not to be taken down exactly
[Nov 28-06 11:48:42]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ just take out "loadmobs" and it should work fine
[Nov 28-06 11:51:4]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ your search_willow func needs to return 1 at the end
[Nov 28-06 11:51:22]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ else it drops through to the search command
[Nov 28-06 11:55:28]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ np
[Nov 28-06 12:29:30]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ depends on what they're a deity of
[Nov 28-06 12:32:30]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ bold cyan sounds good to me
[Dec 2-06 1:18:54]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hey
[Dec 2-06 1:19:34]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm, had that prob with someone else before on main port
[Dec 2-06 1:20:0]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ how bout he sets his stats to 20 all??
[Dec 2-06 2:51:59]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ok, just a second
[Dec 2-06 12:11:19]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ .hack//sign music is great for coding...
[Dec 7-06 19:5:25]Whit %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Are you around ironman?
[Dec 14-06 20:28:27]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ wtf
[Dec 14-06 20:28:33]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ How you know im around?
[Dec 14-06 20:29:41]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Im ok
[Dec 14-06 20:30:3]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ shad?
[Dec 14-06 20:30:5]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ow
[Dec 14-06 20:30:41]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Whit
[Dec 22-06 20:57:54]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ looking at it here, someone probably moved seeker's dir, and the wizhall loads up the box.c in it
[Jan 4-07 11:31:36]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ uh... probably not the best name to use...
[Jan 4-07 11:33:32]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you're talking about "humpy the humpback whale", that's probably ok
[Jan 7-07 17:52:11]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ test
[Feb 18-07 22:14:28]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ am now
[Feb 18-07 22:15:3]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what are you trying to do??
[Feb 18-07 22:15:29]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ah
[Feb 18-07 22:15:43]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that should really be done with a daemon
[Feb 18-07 22:16:5]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ inherit DAEMON;
[Feb 18-07 22:16:45]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Feb 18-07 22:17:57]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ah... that's kind of an odd setup.. but ok
[Feb 18-07 22:37:39]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ does anyone remember who wrote the coach system??
[Feb 18-07 22:38:29]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ let me think
[Feb 18-07 22:39:49]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it might have been nesoo
[Feb 18-07 22:42:23]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ah, I think it was
[Feb 18-07 22:44:37]%^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Nulvect laments that nobody seems to actually use OOP around here...
[Feb 18-07 22:45:43]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ object oriented programming
[Feb 18-07 22:46:51]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ OOP... LPC is not a 100% OOP language nul
[Feb 18-07 22:46:55]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's when you code objects that have interfaces to them and make them interact... it cuts down on people rewriting the same code all the time, keeps things a lot cleaner and easier to mess with
[Feb 18-07 22:47:13]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's not??
[Feb 18-07 22:47:23]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well... not in the OOP sense of say a language like c++
[Feb 18-07 22:50:5]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ there's no destructor exactly built in...
[Feb 18-07 22:50:29]Daos %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ what is the error?
[Feb 18-07 23:41:45]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you just copy the whole coach system and change the rooms and stuff, it should work fine
[Feb 18-07 23:43:55]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ are you including coach.h?? cause that'll look in the wrong dir
[Feb 18-07 23:45:7]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ uh, make it a different dir, with a different header file
[Feb 18-07 23:47:29]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<pd>%^RESET%^ would be a good learning experience to make a new one from scratch
[Feb 19-07 21:23:11]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ um...
[Feb 19-07 21:23:29]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you edited the guild treasury room??
[Feb 19-07 21:25:1]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no it's fine, just trying to understand what you did
[Feb 19-07 21:25:11]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ does the room update when you are not in it??
[Feb 19-07 21:25:19]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ IE, you sit in your workroom and update /d/guilds/blah/blah.c
[Feb 19-07 21:26:25]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ that's kind of odd
[Feb 19-07 21:26:31]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ but ok
[Feb 19-07 21:26:39]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you can go into the treasury after that??
[Feb 19-07 21:27:47]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ ahhhhh, dynamic exit
[Feb 19-07 21:28:5]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ using set_pre_exit_func?? or just an add_action??
[Feb 19-07 21:28:29]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Feb 19-07 21:28:31]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ hang on a sec
[Feb 19-07 22:46:23]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's fine
[Feb 19-07 23:26:46]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ actually all guild oils and stones are the same
[Feb 19-07 23:26:58]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ all that gets set is the descriptions
[Feb 19-07 23:27:56]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ nope it's the same
[Feb 19-07 23:28:12]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ yep
[Feb 19-07 23:28:28]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ someone (whit I think) made an oil inherit so they would all be the same
[Feb 19-07 23:28:30]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's all perception
[Feb 19-07 23:30:8]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ well...
[Feb 19-07 23:31:4]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ I think that letting guilds customize items is not a bad idea, as long as they aren't more powerful than regular items, so I think it would be better to make a general inherit for seals and one for ointments and let all guilds have them (for a price of course)
[Feb 19-07 23:32:8]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ as for armour and weapons, I support the idea someone else came up with of allowing a guild member to bring in an item they already have and issue some command to change the descriptions but keep all else the same
[Feb 19-07 23:32:16]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it can be, to do it right
[Feb 19-07 23:32:28]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ an inherit is a basic template, with a bunch of defaults
[Feb 19-07 23:33:26]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if your room does inherit ROOM; then the ROOM file can inherit CONTAINER and that one can inherit OBJECT ... etc... so you can have a whole line of things that are inherited
[Feb 19-07 23:34:22]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if you google for "lpc inherit" you'll find a more detailed explanation of how it works
[Feb 19-07 23:34:28]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ he may have, I'm not sure
[Feb 19-07 23:37:20]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ it's a little hard to explain, I would suggest you pick a basic file in tirun and check the file it inherits, and try to get an idea how it works
[Feb 19-07 23:37:50]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ /std/
[Feb 19-07 23:38:4]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ if it does inherit ROOM; the file is /std/room.c usually
[Feb 20-07 0:53:23]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ you probably want present("wax", this_player())
[Feb 20-07 4:16:31]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ sure, just a sec
[Feb 24-07 23:50:7]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ sometimes I wonder how descartes and the gang could write a whole mudlib with such minimal use of basic things like.. oh.. variables
[Mar 31-07 15:30:20]Whit %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Which header file?
[Mar 31-07 17:6:4]Whit %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Done
[Mar 31-07 17:32:51]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ no
[Apr 4-07 20:35:19]Whit %^MAGENTA%^<pd>%^RESET%^ Your mom sucks
[Apr 8-07 17:27:55]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ woot, updated ok
[Apr 8-07 17:31:15]Nulvect %^CYAN%^<pd>%^RESET%^ now how the hell do I test this... hmmm
[Jun 23-07 20:38:9]Nulvect <pd> what error??
[Jun 24-07 0:27:38]Daboura <pd> er?
[Jun 24-07 0:29:10]Daboura <pd> I would suggest putting the code on the mirror
[Jun 24-07 0:29:26]Daboura <pd> that way, we can simply clsoe the quest by removing the mirror
[Jun 24-07 0:30:12]Daboura <pd> yup
[Jun 24-07 0:30:30]Daboura <pd> whatever command you want it to be
[Jun 24-07 0:42:36]Daos <pd> what inherit are you using?
[Jun 24-07 0:43:2]Daos <pd> yeah, also over here talking to daboura
[Jun 24-07 0:43:42]Daos <pd> there is a set_closed() you can use
[Jun 24-07 0:45:10]Daos <pd> there is no set_closed() for desc, just override the query_long_closed()
[Jun 24-07 0:45:24]Daos <pd> it will return a string
[Jun 24-07 0:46:24]Daos <pd> the only set_closed() we have takes a 0 or 1 as an argument and checks if the bag is closed or open
[Jun 24-07 4:26:55]Nulvect <pd> uh yeah, here for a bit longer
[Jun 24-07 4:27:29]Nulvect <pd> it's not going to work right on builder's port
[Jun 24-07 4:27:39]Nulvect <pd> there's different code there than on main port
[Jun 24-07 4:39:31]Nulvect <pd> k, I'm out of here for now
[Jun 25-07 2:48:34]Nulvect <pd> sure
[Jun 25-07 2:53:30]Nulvect <pd> well, technically speaking no, it's not needed
[Jun 25-07 2:53:40]Nulvect <pd> I would just do girl->remove()
[Jun 25-07 2:54:0]Nulvect <pd> you can always re-clone her later, and it's not like she'll autoload in the mirror anyway
[Jun 25-07 2:54:50]Nulvect <pd> no prob
[Jun 25-07 22:39:19]Daboura <pd> so I hear there is a vamp quest in the works
[Jun 25-07 22:40:41]Daboura <pd> odd
[Jun 27-07 20:34:29]Daboura <pd> there we go
[Jun 27-07 20:36:5]Nulvect <pd> yep
[Jun 27-07 20:45:13]Daboura <pd> do you remember that LAN allow command?
[Jun 27-07 20:45:29]Daboura <pd> nul
[Jun 27-07 20:54:45]Nulvect <pd> not off hand, I think it's in admintool
[Jun 27-07 20:54:51]Daboura <pd> it's cool
[Jun 27-07 20:54:59]Daboura <pd> I found willing test subject, MUHAHAH
[Jun 27-07 20:54:59]Nulvect <pd> absolute_value(x)
[Jun 27-07 20:55:9]Daboura <pd> I just made my own ;)
[Jun 27-07 22:2:26]Daboura <pd> not really
[Jun 27-07 22:2:54]Daboura <pd> you still have to prove to an admin you would make a good imm
[Jun 27-07 22:3:16]Daboura <pd> you just have no real chance unless you have codes at elast 2 areas
[Jun 27-07 22:3:22]Daboura <pd> evfen if you would make a good imm
[Jun 27-07 22:3:42]Daboura <pd> there is no perfect way to becoming an Imm
[Jun 27-07 22:3:52]Daboura <pd> no schedule to follow
[Jun 27-07 22:4:2]Daboura <pd> well he used to be one
[Jun 27-07 22:4:6]Daboura <pd> which helps :P
[Jun 27-07 22:4:48]Daboura <pd> don't forget to suck up to the admins
[Jun 27-07 22:5:4]Daboura <pd> :P
[Jun 27-07 22:6:46]Nulvect <pd> ok...
[Jun 27-07 22:6:50]Daboura <pd> *too
[Jun 27-07 22:6:56]Nulvect <pd> did you get your question about exits answered, by the way??
[Jun 27-07 22:7:24]Nulvect <pd> k
[Jun 27-07 22:7:40]Nulvect <pd> do I need to come look at it, or can you describe it to me??
[Jun 27-07 22:39:19]Nulvect <pd> we keep track of the exact second you complete a deed, but not of quests... great
[Jun 27-07 22:39:37]Daboura <pd> LOL
[Jun 27-07 23:5:27]Daboura <pd> you are talking about the quest, right?
[Jun 27-07 23:9:21]Daboura <pd> that's fine
[Jun 27-07 23:9:29]Daboura <pd> like I said
[Jun 27-07 23:9:31]Daboura <pd> just get it done
[Jun 27-07 23:9:41]Daboura <pd> when nul gives the thumbs up I will add it
[Jun 27-07 23:11:21]Daboura <pd> and yes, the more there are the weaker they will all be
[Jun 28-07 20:9:0]Daboura <pd> bara bodo bele
[Jun 28-07 20:9:52]Daboura <pd> most excellent
[Jun 28-07 20:10:38]Daboura <pd> good
[Jun 28-07 20:10:44]Daboura <pd> I did see him
[Jun 28-07 20:10:54]Daboura <pd> miss
[Jun 28-07 20:29:14]Daboura <pd> good
[Jun 28-07 20:29:20]Daboura <pd> just working on the tedious part now
[Jun 28-07 20:29:34]Daboura <pd> and watching my file balloon in size :P
[Jun 28-07 20:29:58]Daboura <pd> I'm at 11k now
[Jun 28-07 20:30:6]Daboura <pd> I expect to go over 20
[Jun 28-07 20:31:8]Daboura <pd> the bottem of ls shows
[Jun 28-07 21:20:22]Daboura <pd> that's a no
[Jun 28-07 21:20:30]Daboura <pd> I can barely write my own
[Jun 28-07 23:27:42]Daos <pd> heh, daboura can barely write descriptions
[Jun 28-07 23:28:0]Daos <pd> of course :P
[Jun 28-07 23:28:28]Daos <pd> uh... didn't say I want to help with descriptions
[Jun 28-07 23:28:42]Daos <pd> that is pretty vague
[Jun 28-07 23:28:50]Daos <pd> could be I want to help with room actions or something :P
[Jun 28-07 23:29:10]Daos <pd> masterful? you shouldn't stroke your ego :P
[Jun 28-07 23:29:38]Daos <pd> well... I was grasping for the right word
[Jun 28-07 23:29:44]Daos <pd> stroke was the best I could come up with
[Jun 28-07 23:30:16]Daos <pd> oh, trust me I will
[Jun 28-07 23:30:34]Daos <pd> hold on, jynx is talking to me
[Jun 28-07 23:31:48]Daos <pd> jynx is looking for some work to do and so he brought up the idea of the lich quest, any word on that?
[Jun 28-07 23:32:10]Daboura <pd> I have no problem with someone remaking the lich quest
[Jun 28-07 23:33:22]Daos <pd> sorry but he is idle
[Jun 28-07 23:33:24]Nulvect <pd> just woke up, sorry
[Jun 28-07 23:33:28]Daos <pd> nevermind :P
[Jun 28-07 23:33:52]Daos <pd> no, that is just filler code
[Jun 28-07 23:34:56]Daos <pd> no but with a question like is do stuff here actually what you write? I figured that was just code you have to put in
[Jun 28-07 23:35:10]Daboura <pd> perhaps if you could explain what the heck you are tlaking about :P
[Jun 28-07 23:36:56]Daos <pd> yeah, what he means is you have to put the stuff to make the code work
[Jun 28-07 23:37:26]Daos <pd> no idea because didn't look at the inherit
[Jun 28-07 23:38:14]Daos <pd> sorry, thought you were asking anyone on this line
[Jun 29-07 15:46:11]Nulvect <pd> every 4 rounds that should be fine
[Jun 29-07 15:49:37]Nulvect <pd> most people are idle
[Jun 29-07 15:50:15]Nulvect <pd> probably
[Jun 29-07 16:0:18]Nulvect <pd> that went a lot faster than I thought it would
[Jun 29-07 16:0:36]Nulvect <pd> figured out their skills
[Jun 29-07 16:0:40]Nulvect <pd> now for stats
[Jun 29-07 16:1:10]Nulvect <pd> nod
[Jun 29-07 16:1:34]Nulvect <pd> glad I made choke, cause drink will be similar...
[Jun 29-07 16:1:50]Nulvect <pd> new abil
[Jun 29-07 16:2:0]Nulvect <pd> the old one sucked, this one is good
[Jun 29-07 16:2:16]Nulvect <pd> nope
[Jun 29-07 16:2:26]Nulvect <pd> not unless you make a thug
[Jun 29-07 16:3:16]Nulvect <pd> yep, looks like I've had a hand in all their attack abils and most of their deception ones.. I'd say that's redoing
[Jun 29-07 16:4:36]Nulvect <pd> might even give them the new circle when I make it...hmmm
[Jun 29-07 16:4:44]Nulvect <pd> good good
[Jun 29-07 16:12:8]Nulvect <pd> no problem
[Jun 29-07 16:46:17]Nulvect <pd> ok
[Jun 29-07 16:46:49]Nulvect <pd> ok...
[Jun 29-07 16:47:35]Nulvect <pd> uh, sounds fine the way it is
[Jun 29-07 16:48:37]Nulvect <pd> you might want to just make it a down exit in that case
[Jun 29-07 16:48:47]Nulvect <pd> and describe it in the room as stairs going down
[Jun 29-07 16:49:21]Nulvect <pd> perhaps even add a little pre exit func that just shows a message, "The stairs creak loudly as you descend"
[Jun 29-07 16:49:25]Nulvect <pd> or something
[Jun 29-07 16:49:31]Nulvect <pd> ah
[Jun 29-07 16:49:35]Nulvect <pd> that's not that bad then
[Jun 29-07 16:50:15]Nulvect <pd> shrug
[Jun 29-07 16:50:17]Nulvect <pd> ok
[Jun 29-07 16:52:33]Nulvect <pd> ah, ok
[Jun 29-07 16:52:51]Nulvect <pd> so they're heading toward the center
[Jun 29-07 16:53:5]Nulvect <pd> looks fine to me
[Jun 29-07 16:54:7]Nulvect <pd> that's fine
[Jun 29-07 17:23:58]Nulvect <pd> tier
[Jun 29-07 17:39:37]Nulvect <pd> alright, all skills and stats info looks good, got names for most of those abils we came up with...
[Jun 29-07 17:40:21]Nulvect <pd> good good
[Jun 29-07 17:40:34]Nulvect <pd> I think we need some more stuff to give them
[Jun 29-07 17:41:48]Nulvect <pd> probably another attack abil, an attack spell or two would be good, and at least one defense abil or spell..
[Jun 29-07 17:43:6]Nulvect <pd> I'd rather keep it between staff and you two
[Jun 29-07 17:43:42]Nulvect <pd> k
[Jun 29-07 17:48:28]Nulvect <pd> mailing to carina
[Jun 29-07 17:51:46]Nulvect <pd> martial arts are mainly for monks
[Jun 29-07 17:52:22]Nulvect <pd> one might be ok
[Jun 29-07 17:53:41]Nulvect <pd> crescent... hmmm... that might be good
[Jun 29-07 17:55:47]Nulvect <pd> I forgot to include drink in there, they'll be able to use that in combat
[Jun 29-07 17:56:29]Nulvect <pd> sounds like a good way to get your teeth ripped out
[Jun 29-07 17:59:7]Nulvect <pd> hmmm, maybe
[Jun 29-07 17:59:33]Nulvect <pd> that's psionics though
[Jun 29-07 18:0:43]Nulvect <pd> enthrall I think
[Jun 29-07 18:1:1]Nulvect <pd> well, that's basically trance
[Jun 29-07 18:2:55]Nulvect <pd> sideswipe??
[Jun 29-07 18:3:39]Nulvect <pd> definitely need an attack spell, and a defensive ability
[Jun 29-07 18:4:33]Nulvect <pd> hmm, don't think so no
[Jun 29-07 18:6:31]Nulvect <pd> so just a self-buff
[Jun 29-07 18:9:18]Nulvect <pd> I wonder if I would get any reaction if I made a spell called nigritude
[Jun 29-07 18:10:36]Nulvect <pd> that was my point... it sounds like that... but it means darkness
[Jun 29-07 18:15:48]Nulvect <pd> hmmm
[Jun 29-07 18:22:6]Nulvect <pd> a bit
[Jul 1-07 17:44:31]Daboura <pd> you there?
[Jul 1-07 21:27:23]Daboura <pd> negative
[Jul 1-07 21:27:49]Daboura <pd> :P
[Jul 1-07 21:27:57]Daboura <pd> sorry, not in a good mood :P
[Jul 1-07 21:28:27]Daboura <pd> not really. My family just f'ed up a nice weekend I had planned.
[Jul 1-07 21:29:5]Daboura <pd> yah, I just hope I can recover next weekend
[Jul 1-07 21:29:21]Daboura <pd> well, let me tell you the quick synopsis
[Jul 1-07 21:29:37]Daboura <pd> I *had* planned to tak the gf strawberry picking yesterday
[Jul 1-07 21:30:15]Daboura <pd> well, my parrents invited us up to my uncles cabin for a fun weekend of jet skiing, boating, drinking and an overall good time
[Jul 1-07 21:30:23]Daboura <pd> so we talked about it and decided to go up to teh cabin
[Jul 1-07 21:30:49]Daboura <pd> well.... thanks to my parent's horrible directs and mismanagement, we got to play cards
[Jul 1-07 21:30:57]Daboura <pd> and watch some tv
[Jul 1-07 21:31:7]Daboura <pd> and I got to waste $40 in gad to do it
[Jul 1-07 21:31:13]Daboura <pd> *gas
[Jul 1-07 21:31:31]Daboura <pd> yah, I'm not happy, seeing as how this is the last weekend to do the picking
[Jul 1-07 21:32:41]Daboura <pd> like I said, I hope I can recover next weekend with the camping trip I have planned
[Jul 1-07 21:32:56]Daboura <pd> *fumes*
[Jul 1-07 21:34:22]Daboura <pd> me too
[Jul 1-07 21:34:32]Daboura <pd> abunch of her friends are going too
[Jul 1-07 21:34:48]Daboura <pd> so at least she'll have someone to talk to besides my pathetic family
[Jul 1-07 21:35:0]Daboura <pd> thanks
[Jul 1-07 23:14:23]Daboura <pd> hold on a sec
[Jul 1-07 23:15:1]Daboura <pd> hold on a sec, sheesh :P
[Jul 1-07 23:33:37]Daboura <pd> I'm not saying they have to be epic quests
[Jul 1-07 23:33:55]Daboura <pd> and they can be incorporated into the current mud
[Jul 1-07 23:34:11]Daboura <pd> fun things to keep players busy
[Jul 1-07 23:34:25]Daboura <pd> sure, if you wanna be lame
[Jul 1-07 23:34:27]Daboura <pd> :P
[Jul 1-07 23:35:45]Daboura <pd> why is that?
[Jul 1-07 23:36:37]Daboura <pd> just keep in mind
[Jul 1-07 23:36:43]Daboura <pd> if he does decide to make you an imm....
[Jul 1-07 23:36:53]Daboura <pd> you would still be workign for me
[Jul 1-07 23:37:5]Daboura <pd> and I don't let the imms just do their own thing
[Jul 1-07 23:37:25]Daboura <pd> LOL
[Jul 1-07 23:37:31]Daboura <pd> no one is doing guilds
[Jul 1-07 23:37:43]Daboura <pd> I still want them all wiped :P
[Jul 1-07 23:37:57]Daboura <pd> it wont happen :P
[Jul 1-07 23:38:3]Daboura <pd> I'm not that cruel
[Jul 1-07 23:38:31]Daboura <pd> are caps still in place?
[Jul 1-07 23:39:13]Daboura <pd> that's ok
[Jul 1-07 23:39:17]Daboura <pd> I'd rather still havea  cap
[Jul 1-07 23:39:35]Daboura <pd> hrm
[Jul 1-07 23:39:41]Daboura <pd> I might have to fix that
[Jul 1-07 23:40:3]Daboura <pd> guilds should HAVE to be picky about their members
[Jul 1-07 23:40:23]Daboura <pd> it took me months to get nesoo to finish that system
[Jul 1-07 23:40:29]Daboura <pd> and I have no idea where it stands
[Jul 1-07 23:41:37]Daboura <pd> aye, he didn't want to have to be bothered by players
[Jul 1-07 23:42:31]Daboura <pd> sure
[Jul 1-07 23:43:23]Daboura <pd> I havn't interacted enough with anyone to make that kind of call
[Jul 1-07 23:44:13]Daboura <pd> you still bother me though? :P
[Jul 1-07 23:44:15]Daboura <pd> j/k
[Jul 1-07 23:44:39]Daboura <pd> ok, let me put it this way to you so we can be perfeclty clear
[Jul 1-07 23:45:47]Daboura <pd> if stormy makes you an Imm, you would be doing events, and have no authority outside of your directive. If you apply and I select you, you will be doing events, and have no authority outside of your directive.
[Jul 1-07 23:45:59]Daboura <pd> I don't want to be mean
[Jul 1-07 23:46:7]Daboura <pd> but you will not be doing guilds
[Jul 1-07 23:46:11]Daboura <pd> either way
[Jul 1-07 23:46:53]Daboura <pd> a simple reason, players base
[Jul 1-07 23:47:9]Daboura <pd> with a limited number of players we have a limited number of jobs to do
[Jul 1-07 23:47:47]Daboura <pd> nul is doing balance, which is perhaps the most important
[Jul 1-07 23:47:55]Daboura <pd> and I am having daos approve new areas
[Jul 1-07 23:48:15]Daboura <pd> and until another need arises, I don't need anyone else
[Jul 1-07 23:48:27]Daboura <pd> 1 need I do have though is a low player base
[Jul 1-07 23:48:31]Daboura <pd> I want it bigger
[Jul 1-07 23:48:57]Daboura <pd> and outside of getting a balanced game, and a bigger world, the only thing I can think of is events
[Jul 1-07 23:49:13]Daboura <pd> and that is where this postion comes in
[Jul 1-07 23:49:35]Daboura <pd> if the player base were to get big enough, and the guilds filled up with active players, we would than need a guild imm
[Jul 1-07 23:49:47]Daboura <pd> you would keep building on the builders posrt
[Jul 1-07 23:49:49]Daboura <pd> *por
[Jul 1-07 23:49:53]Daboura <pd> *port even
[Jul 1-07 23:50:13]Daboura <pd> you can build on the main port
[Jul 1-07 23:50:21]Daboura <pd> but I prefer you do any testing over there
[Jul 1-07 23:50:33]Daboura <pd> for the most part
[Jul 1-07 23:50:45]Daboura <pd> with ironmans new security, leaks would not happen
[Jul 1-07 23:50:47]Daboura <pd> yes
[Jul 1-07 23:50:53]Daboura <pd> to run the events
[Jul 1-07 23:51:21]Daboura <pd> within the scope of the events, the holder of this position would have a lot of power
[Jul 1-07 23:51:35]Daboura <pd> well yah
[Jul 1-07 23:51:43]Daboura <pd> I wont through the newbie to the wolves :P
[Jul 1-07 23:51:47]Daboura <pd> aka players
[Jul 1-07 23:52:31]Daboura <pd> why you think you would be good for the position
[Jul 1-07 23:52:58]Daboura <pd> if you get the position, and you can think of other ways to increase the player base, by all means, let me know and we can talk about it
[Jul 1-07 23:53:38]Daboura <pd> what I know doesn't matter. You are trying to get a job, treat it like such
[Jul 1-07 23:54:2]Daos <pd> amun is being really formal to call you sir
[Jul 1-07 23:54:28]Daos <pd> it's probably out of habit
[Jul 1-07 23:55:30]Daboura <pd> 2 weeks
[Jul 2-07 2:45:54]Daos <pd> I think he is idle
[Jul 2-07 2:54:35]Daos <pd> I'm reviewing Ironman's area for approval
[Jul 2-07 2:54:51]Daos <pd> as much as fun that you can have ;)
[Jul 2-07 2:55:43]Daos <pd> nul is also a reviewer, but I have been assigned the job of being in charge of all areas on PD
[Jul 2-07 2:56:21]Daos <pd> yeah, I kind of like the job desc :P
[Jul 2-07 2:56:51]Daos <pd> next I will be amun's boss ;)
[Jul 2-07 2:57:3]Daos <pd> wouldn't that be funny? lol
[Jul 2-07 2:57:23]Daos <pd> because we are going to have a new imm fill that position
[Jul 2-07 2:57:29]Daos <pd> hint
[Jul 2-07 2:57:51]Daos <pd> if you didn't know, I'd have to wonder
[Jul 2-07 2:57:57]Daos <pd> though I already do that about a lot of things
[Jul 2-07 2:58:23]Daos <pd> yeah, exactly
[Jul 2-07 2:58:31]Daos <pd> I also mentioned it to him
[Jul 2-07 2:59:1]Daos <pd> that you might be an imm here
[Jul 2-07 2:59:57]Daos <pd> uh... no let me rephrase... I said so I heard that amun might be coming over here as an imm :P
[Jul 2-07 3:0:31]Daos <pd> and besides, I do have some guts :P
[Jul 2-07 3:1:23]Daos <pd> I thought of another ability for vampires that nul might use, I think it's pretty good
[Jul 2-07 3:1:47]Daos <pd> blood transferrence
[Jul 2-07 3:2:35]Daos <pd> the idea is that a vampire can transfer some of his blood to another vampire, it would probably be a higher level ability
[Jul 2-07 3:3:15]Daos <pd> it's quite original, actually
[Jul 2-07 3:3:21]Daos <pd> so I don't know how you saw that
[Jul 2-07 3:4:1]Daos <pd> hmm, well he may or may not use it
[Jul 2-07 3:6:11]Daos <pd> that would render the class pretty useless
[Jul 2-07 3:6:29]Daos <pd> if they can't xp during the day
[Jul 2-07 3:6:47]Daos <pd> and no one would want to tackle that
[Jul 2-07 3:7:25]Daos <pd> bp is probably just going to be hp, which is an easy change
[Jul 2-07 3:8:17]Daos <pd> you are missing what I said... instead of having hp for vampires, it will be where the bp points are stored
[Jul 2-07 3:9:9]Daos <pd> blood points can be called hp or anything really, they are still going to be used by the abils/spells
[Jul 2-07 3:33:29]Daos <pd> trying to, but it's hot in my room so also doing my best not to fall asleep
[Jul 2-07 3:34:45]Daos <pd> I need to make a command that will quickly scan a monster, armor, weapon, etc and give me quick info on it
[Jul 2-07 3:50:29]Daos <pd> hey amun?
[Jul 2-07 3:51:7]Daos <pd> yeah, my friend is making like 9.25 or something an hour stacking boxes at a warehouse... working 5-2 and I make like 8.25 in fast food... I need a better job :P
[Jul 2-07 3:52:15]Daos <pd> I picked up a second job though doing some filing and computer work for a lady at $10/hour, not bad
[Jul 2-07 3:52:23]Daos <pd> she runs a therapy company
[Jul 2-07 3:52:33]Daos <pd> it's only like once or twice a month though
[Jul 2-07 3:57:58]Daos <pd> it's coming
[Jul 2-07 3:58:42]Daos <pd> coding a new command for myself
[Jul 2-07 4:27:24]Daos <pd> yeah?
[Jul 2-07 4:28:6]Daos <pd> sure, what's up?
[Jul 2-07 4:30:8]Daos <pd> you have the voice part done?
[Jul 2-07 4:30:30]Daos <pd> ok, so you want to use the input_to function to get the player to answer yes or no
[Jul 2-07 4:31:46]Daos <pd> input_to("function name", I_NOECHO | I_NOESC);
[Jul 2-07 4:32:18]Daos <pd> man input_to
[Jul 2-07 4:32:48]Daos <pd> once the player answers yes or no, it will go the function where they will finish doing whatever
[Jul 2-07 4:32:52]Daos <pd> if that makes better sense to you
[Jul 2-07 4:33:52]Daos <pd> hold on a second
[Jul 2-07 5:43:29]Daos <pd> over here
[Jul 2-07 5:44:41]Daos <pd> was working on that command, you still need me?
[Jul 2-07 20:4:42]Daos <pd> hey amun
[Jul 2-07 20:6:14]Daos <pd> I was checking nul has any ideas on our problem Amun
[Jul 2-07 20:6:26]Daos <pd> err, checking if
[Jul 2-07 20:6:34]Daos <pd> that is what he said
[Jul 2-07 20:7:8]Daos <pd> do we really need to keep ironman's system (this is for daboura and nul specifically)?
[Jul 2-07 20:8:2]Daos <pd> I don't really remember if anyone approved his code or he had just thrown it at the spur of a moment thing
[Jul 2-07 20:8:40]Daos <pd> it's possible come to think of it that stormy approved the system
[Jul 2-07 20:9:48]Daos <pd> any thoughts on that nul?
[Jul 2-07 20:10:18]Daos <pd> yeah, well I know that whit or I did not give him the go on adding that security to builder's
[Jul 2-07 20:12:32]Daos <pd> I'm also not sure ohw to uninstall it completely
[Jul 2-07 20:12:36]Daos <pd> how
[Jul 2-07 20:13:4]Daos <pd> he has the code in several files
[Jul 2-07 20:13:36]Daos <pd> when he is he on usually?
[Jul 2-07 20:14:36]<pd> Daos nods
[Jul 2-07 20:14:54]Nulvect <pd> it's integrated into the master object daos
[Jul 2-07 20:15:2]Daos <pd> you know the answer to that already
[Jul 2-07 20:15:8]Daos <pd> I figured, nul
[Jul 2-07 20:19:2]Nulvect <pd> I'm not sure really
[Jul 2-07 20:22:16]Nulvect <pd> something else might be good
[Jul 2-07 20:28:20]Daboura <pd> yes
[Jul 2-07 20:28:24]Daos <pd> he is busy I believe
[Jul 2-07 20:33:12]Nulvect <pd> that sounds pretty decent
[Jul 2-07 20:34:0]Nulvect <pd> ah, forgot to put it on, will do that now
[Jul 2-07 20:34:4]Nulvect <pd> err, wrong line
[Jul 2-07 20:34:16]Nulvect <pd> yeah that's a little better
[Jul 2-07 20:36:0]Nulvect <pd> I think it would be better to just go with the blood pool
[Jul 2-07 20:36:16]Nulvect <pd> we already have to help drac get "special" blood
[Jul 2-07 20:36:16]Daos <pd> you guys are really thinking deep on this
[Jul 2-07 20:36:34]Nulvect <pd> did you read the summary I posted daos??
[Jul 2-07 20:36:38]Nulvect <pd> this thing is long
[Jul 2-07 20:37:4]Daos <pd> yeah, it's quite a detailed quest... though I'm not sure I particularly like the idea of the slashing of the wrist
[Jul 2-07 20:37:12]Nulvect <pd> nah, long and detailed is cool
[Jul 2-07 20:37:14]Daos <pd> which I expressed to amun
[Jul 2-07 20:37:38]Daos <pd> some people might get the wrong interpretation, that's all
[Jul 2-07 20:38:14]Daos <pd> and if we are still under a "G" rating, slashing of the wrist probably wouldn't be appropriate... do you agree?
[Jul 2-07 20:39:10]Daos <pd> are we deemed "G" rated or PG-13 now nul or daboura, if you want to chime in?
[Jul 2-07 20:39:32]Nulvect <pd> the lines are supposedly G rated, but the playing never has been
[Jul 2-07 20:39:48]Daos <pd> I know that stormy always said that we want to have content that is appropriate for a "G" rated audience
[Jul 2-07 20:39:58]Daos <pd> but we have changed
[Jul 2-07 20:40:8]Daboura <pd> how about I just make a call on this :P
[Jul 2-07 20:40:14]Daos <pd> go ahead, daboura :P
[Jul 2-07 20:40:16]Daboura <pd> so here is my call
[Jul 2-07 20:40:26]Nulvect <pd> "In a spray of blood, you finish off <name>" <-- that's been in since I started playing here
[Jul 2-07 20:40:36]Nulvect <pd> and is not G-rated at all
[Jul 2-07 20:40:42]Daboura <pd> the lines are G, while the content must stay pg-13
[Jul 2-07 20:41:8]Daos <pd> ok, question... does slashing of the wrist fall under PG-13?
[Jul 2-07 20:41:24]Daboura <pd> if they can show tits in a pg-13, yes that counts
[Jul 2-07 20:41:32]Nulvect <pd> they can do that now??
[Jul 2-07 20:41:34]Daos <pd> fair enough :P
[Jul 2-07 20:41:44]Nulvect <pd> nice
[Jul 2-07 20:41:58]Daos <pd> but they don't show any cleavage, it's usually blacked out or the scene is a quick one :P
[Jul 2-07 20:41:58]Nulvect <pd> oh, "blood to be drunk", not drank
[Jul 2-07 20:43:6]Nulvect <pd> oh, nearly forgot... need to go for a while
[Jul 2-07 20:46:34]Daos <pd> purg wouldn't be bad
[Jul 2-07 20:46:40]Daos <pd> got a lot of other blodo stuff there :P
[Jul 2-07 20:46:44]Daos <pd> blood
[Jul 2-07 20:47:8]Daos <pd> hmm, maybe on the outskirts
[Jul 2-07 20:47:34]Daos <pd> I was thinking the throne room personally
[Jul 2-07 20:47:52]Daos <pd> but I'd just make them look through purg for it
[Jul 2-07 20:48:16]Daos <pd> true :P
[Jul 2-07 20:48:28]Daos <pd> I remember that annoying assassin
[Jul 2-07 20:49:10]Daos <pd> we will worry about that later, but put it in a new room
[Jul 2-07 20:49:26]Daos <pd> somewhere in purg, not in the city though
[Jul 2-07 20:50:14]Daos <pd> you can make the new room over there in your dir and will move it over when it's ready, ok?
[Jul 2-07 20:50:46]Daos <pd> ok, got that :)
[Jul 2-07 20:54:44]Daos <pd> that works
[Jul 2-07 20:56:4]Daos <pd> you know what that does?
[Jul 2-07 20:56:26]Daos <pd> yeah, wouldn't have to be 25 per-se
[Jul 2-07 20:56:58]Daos <pd> let's think about it another way amun
[Jul 2-07 20:57:6]Daos <pd> how much charisma would a level 20-25 player have? and go with that number
[Jul 2-07 20:58:12]Daos <pd> wait, thought you were asking if 25 aggressive was alright for level 20-25 mobs?
[Jul 2-07 21:5:6]Daboura <pd> ack! PD line spam!
[Jul 2-07 21:5:26]Daboura <pd> you should be! :P
[Jul 2-07 21:5:40]Daboura <pd> :P
[Jul 2-07 21:6:4]Daboura <pd> no questions tonight
[Jul 2-07 21:6:40]Daboura <pd> flask?
[Jul 2-07 21:6:56]Daboura <pd> I did eh? what did it do?
[Jul 2-07 21:7:6]Daboura <pd> meh
[Jul 2-07 21:7:48]Daboura <pd> fancy
[Jul 2-07 21:8:12]Daboura <pd> LOL
[Jul 2-07 21:8:16]Daboura <pd> I love the telescope
[Jul 2-07 21:8:28]Daboura <pd> who knows
[Jul 2-07 21:9:26]Daboura <pd> feel free to
[Jul 2-07 21:10:26]Daboura <pd> NO!
[Jul 2-07 21:10:30]Daboura <pd> :P
[Jul 2-07 21:12:44]Daboura <pd> does it work?
[Jul 2-07 21:14:10]Daboura <pd> well thats good
[Jul 2-07 21:20:46]Daboura <pd> my god I am starting to hate this system :P
[Jul 2-07 21:23:42]Daboura <pd> I designed this lovely perfect system
[Jul 2-07 21:24:6]Daboura <pd> and then I tried to connect it to the rest of the system, and my lovely system is being mutilated by it
[Jul 2-07 23:10:43]Nulvect <pd> nope, all dead
[Jul 2-07 23:11:25]Nulvect <pd> ok
[Jul 3-07 23:33:3]Daos <pd> hey amun
[Jul 3-07 23:34:1]Daos <pd> going through papers in my room
[Jul 3-07 23:36:41]Daos <pd> yeah, kind of cleaning up
[Jul 5-07 20:56:0]Nulvect <pd> you need to be able to get the player object somehow, maybe through this_player()
[Jul 5-07 20:56:52]Nulvect <pd> then it's easy: if (this_player()->query_level() >= 20 && this_player()->query_level() <= 25) { do something special here; }
[Jul 5-07 20:58:4]Nulvect <pd> you want to do this when the mob dies right??
[Jul 5-07 20:59:0]Nulvect <pd> there's a set_die() you can use but I don't think it allows you to grab the killer
[Jul 5-07 20:59:58]Nulvect <pd> let me check something
[Jul 5-07 21:1:24]Nulvect <pd> ahh I had the sense to modify it, good
[Jul 5-07 21:1:38]Nulvect <pd> do this:
[Jul 5-07 21:1:58]Nulvect <pd> set_die( (: die_func :) ); in your create()
[Jul 5-07 21:2:8]Nulvect <pd> then you make void die_func(object killer) {
[Jul 5-07 21:2:14]Nulvect <pd> as a separate function
[Jul 5-07 21:2:20]Nulvect <pd> and it will call that when the mob dies
[Jul 5-07 21:5:16]Nulvect <pd> sure
[Jul 5-07 21:5:42]Nulvect <pd> we'll make the changes on main port ourselves when we move it over, since it's possible things have been changed here since the builders copy was made
[Jul 5-07 22:13:11]Daboura <pd> not everyone is as evil about it as I
[Jul 5-07 22:13:43]Daboura <pd> damn straight
[Jul 5-07 22:14:43]Daboura <pd> there will be interviews
[Jul 5-07 22:14:49]Daboura <pd> trying to dream up questions
[Jul 5-07 22:15:3]Daboura <pd> LOL
[Jul 5-07 22:16:5]Daboura <pd> bah!
[Jul 5-07 22:16:19]Daboura <pd> jsut you an iron
[Jul 5-07 22:16:35]Daboura <pd> as did I
[Jul 5-07 22:16:47]Daboura <pd> well, might as well interview now if you have tine
[Jul 5-07 22:17:11]Daboura <pd> on players port
[Jul 5-07 22:58:13]Daboura <pd> vamp has priority
[Jul 5-07 23:12:25]Nulvect <pd> amun, you can only have one set_die, the last one will take precedence, but you can add the code you need into the existing function it calls
[Jul 7-07 1:1:19]<pd> Nulvect growls
[Jul 8-07 21:45:28]Nulvect <pd> if you are still there amun, the answer is yes, try to have different room descriptions aside from in that one area
[Jul 9-07 23:36:31]Daboura <pd> ?
[Jul 11-07 19:19:22]Daboura <pd> yo
[Jul 11-07 19:33:8]Daboura <pd> I peeked, but  don't remamber what I thought
[Jul 11-07 22:25:24]Nulvect <pd> uh.. what's the problem??
[Jul 11-07 22:26:32]Nulvect <pd> hmm
[Jul 11-07 22:44:7]Nulvect <pd> ni he zui le ma
[Jul 11-07 23:8:45]Nulvect <pd> can't have spaces in function names
[Jul 11-07 23:9:9]Nulvect <pd> and string *given makes given an array, just be sure that's what you want
[Jul 11-07 23:9:47]Nulvect <pd> you probably don't need the * though
[Jul 12-07 20:54:41]Nulvect <pd> sure, just a sec
[Jul 16-07 22:11:21]Nulvect <pd> hmm
[Jul 16-07 22:12:15]Nulvect <pd> make sure the book has the same ID that the things check for
[Jul 17-07 21:18:19]Nulvect <pd> probably
[Jul 17-07 21:23:37]Nulvect <pd> I'll take a look at it in a while
[Jul 17-07 21:23:43]Nulvect <pd> pizza awaits
[Jul 17-07 21:46:4]Daboura <pd> :P
[Jul 17-07 21:46:56]Daboura <pd> bah
[Jul 17-07 21:47:8]Daboura <pd> so tired and grumpy I don't feel like doing anything
[Jul 17-07 21:51:58]Daboura <pd> that was last night :P
[Jul 17-07 21:52:24]Daboura <pd> hehe
[Jul 17-07 21:52:38]Daboura <pd> it's nice to have a hot gf, that's for sure :P
[Jul 17-07 21:53:50]Daboura <pd> tsk tsk
[Jul 17-07 21:57:2]Nulvect <pd> pizza partially consumed... time to look at that code
[Jul 19-07 21:5:27]Daboura <pd> stormy and NS did something over there the other night
[Jul 19-07 21:5:45]Daboura <pd> that junk is over my head :P
[Jul 19-07 21:5:57]Nulvect <pd> that stuff shouldn't be going to players, blah... it should be stderr and/or in a log file
[Jul 19-07 21:17:13]A shadow <pd> we did nothing to builders
[Jul 19-07 21:17:25]A shadow <pd> we worked on the server
[Jul 19-07 21:17:41]Nulvect <pd> it's just a problem it seems to have every now and then
[Jul 19-07 21:18:7]A shadow <pd> probably one of Whits network hacks
[Jul 19-07 21:21:33]A shadow <pd> turn the line off
[Jul 19-07 21:21:39]A shadow <pd> is it info line?
[Jul 19-07 21:22:17]A shadow <pd> gotta be whit's network thing
[Jul 19-07 21:40:2]Nulvect <pd> probably be like that til it reboots a bit
[Jul 19-07 23:9:43]Nulvect <pd> finally writing an inheritable file for seals
[Jul 20-07 13:7:32]Nulvect <pd> woot
[Jul 20-07 13:32:31]Nulvect <pd> you getting that now??
[Jul 20-07 13:32:47]Nulvect <pd> that sucks.. that's the emote database
[Jul 20-07 13:33:37]Nulvect <pd> almost got the seal inheritable ready
[Jul 20-07 13:34:1]Nulvect <pd> I might need to tweak it so that basic tirun seals can use it too, where you can't set the location
[Jul 20-07 13:35:19]Nulvect <pd> it'll be a simple matter once I get the bugs out of this
[Jul 20-07 13:35:25]Nulvect <pd> hopefully before midnight :P
[Jul 22-07 6:7:58]Daos <pd> sleep well when you go :)
[Jul 22-07 23:2:17]Nulvect <pd> is everything ok over there?? I've seen twice now that builders closed a connection unexpectedly
[Jul 22-07 23:2:49]Nulvect <pd> k
[Jul 22-07 23:2:55]Nulvect <pd> ask away
[Jul 22-07 23:4:5]Nulvect <pd> if I'm not actively paying attention, I usually check in right before I go to sleep and right when I wake up, and whenever I get home or before I leave, and often I just glance over here now and then when doing other things
[Jul 22-07 23:7:27]Nulvect <pd> as far as I know, we don't have any general invasions set up to just go whenever
[Jul 22-07 23:7:37]Nulvect <pd> that will be the job of the new imm dab hires
[Jul 23-07 13:21:17]Nulvect <pd> doesn't look like it
[Jul 23-07 13:44:51]Nulvect <pd> what's being retarded about it??
[Jul 23-07 13:45:49]Nulvect <pd> hmmmm
[Jul 23-07 13:46:9]Nulvect <pd> that's... pretty weird
[Jul 23-07 13:48:7]Nulvect <pd> you can try mailing whit or ns about it, I don't recall how it was fixed last time
[Jul 23-07 13:55:5]Nulvect <pd> like what??
[Jul 23-07 13:56:14]Nulvect <pd> wonderful
[Jul 23-07 13:56:42]Nulvect <pd> I haven't seen them yet, but I don't sit over there for very long usually
[Jul 23-07 13:57:18]Nulvect <pd> far as I know you are
[Jul 23-07 13:57:38]Nulvect <pd> mail this stuff to whit and/or nightshade, pretty sure it was one of them who fixed it before
[Jul 23-07 13:57:40]Nulvect <pd> no
[Jul 23-07 15:40:47]Nulvect <pd> uh, do what??
[Jul 23-07 15:41:7]Nulvect <pd> oh heh
[Jul 23-07 22:26:48]Nulvect <pd> man, it's boring editing one abil into another
[Jul 23-07 22:27:50]Nulvect <pd> often I just rewrite it from scratch
[Jul 23-07 22:33:18]Nulvect <pd> shrug
[Jul 23-07 22:33:44]Nulvect <pd> livens up the monotony of debugging
[Jul 23-07 23:33:42]Nulvect <pd> up to 9k for drink now..blah
[Jul 23-07 23:34:22]Nulvect <pd> 9k of code
[Jul 23-07 23:34:34]Nulvect <pd> yep
[Jul 23-07 23:35:4]Nulvect <pd> that's not counting the stop command to stop drinking
[Jul 23-07 23:35:22]Nulvect <pd> which is close to 2k itself
[Jul 23-07 23:35:42]Nulvect <pd> heh
[Jul 23-07 23:47:52]Nulvect <pd> I'm sure you'll figure it out...
[Jul 24-07 0:1:44]Nulvect <pd> heh
[Jul 27-07 0:18:13]Nulvect <pd> you can ask on this line if you need help, kastel
[Jul 27-07 0:18:19]Nulvect <pd> if you can hear this, that is
[Aug 2-07 1:47:41]Nulvect <pd> use this line to talk to us kaster
[Aug 2-07 1:51:5]Daos <pd> set_short()
[Aug 2-07 1:51:21]Daos <pd> as a general rule, all functions are in lowercase
[Aug 2-07 1:53:33]Daos <pd> how is life treating you kastel?
[Aug 2-07 1:53:59]Daos <pd> kind of got something about you having something in your head that makes you evil
[Aug 2-07 1:54:3]Daos <pd> that is pretty weird
[Aug 2-07 1:55:7]Daos <pd> yeah, it needs to be a valid limb
[Aug 2-07 1:55:11]Daos <pd> torso, arms, head, etc
[Aug 2-07 1:55:47]Daos <pd> so it should be "torso", "head", you get the idea
[Aug 2-07 1:58:43]Daos <pd> help balarm micky and go by that
[Aug 2-07 2:6:24]Daos <pd> set_stats(10)
[Aug 2-07 2:7:8]Daos <pd> set_stats("dexterity", 20)
[Aug 2-07 2:7:30]Daos <pd> you can also do a temporary stat thing with add_stat_bonus()
[Aug 2-07 2:8:4]Daos <pd> add_stat_bonus("dexterity", 20, 5)
[Aug 2-07 2:8:14]Daos <pd> that last number is the amount of time you want the stat bonus to last
[Aug 2-07 2:9:10]Daos <pd> yeah, but you did check out the balance requirements right?
[Aug 2-07 2:9:28]Daos <pd> you don't want to give too high of a bonus on armour
[Aug 2-07 2:10:0]Daos <pd> makes things easier and then as you get more into coding you can start adding other bonuses
[Aug 2-07 2:12:26]Daos <pd> don't let them hurt each other
[Aug 2-07 2:12:40]Daos <pd> if you are talking about RL that is
[Aug 2-07 2:25:56]Daos <pd> you don't want it to happen too frequently
[Aug 2-07 2:27:16]Daos <pd> ok, will do that in a few minutes
[Sep 25-07 7:15:36]Amun <pd> sorry have to go fast
[Oct 25-07 20:25:22]Stormbringer <pd> test
[Oct 26-07 18:7:20]Amun <pd> are hospitals sexy?
[Oct 26-07 18:7:42]Amun <pd> what hospitals have you been to? ll
[Oct 26-07 18:13:30]Amun <pd> i can give you the code for the room
[Oct 26-07 18:13:32]Nulvect <pd> it's just like the oil shop but it makes stones instead of oil and doesn't set_uses() in the stones, just makes a bunch of them
[Oct 26-07 18:15:12]Nulvect <pd> ah
[Nov 28-07 23:57:26]Nulvect <pd> what do you need help with??
[Nov 28-07 23:58:4]Nulvect <pd> bah, buggy line
[Nov 28-07 23:58:46]Nulvect <pd> if you need help from the staff you can use this line to talk to us, but for some reason we can't start it up from this side
[Nov 28-07 23:59:40]Amun <pd> but yeah, if you need anything more micky, just holler on the pd line
[Nov 28-07 23:59:50]Amun <pd> back to sequences
[Nov 29-07 0:11:38]Daos <pd> I'm also here if you need any help
[Nov 29-07 0:13:38]Daos <pd> alright :)
[Nov 29-07 0:13:56]Amun <pd> plinking or plugging?
[Nov 29-07 0:14:0]Amun <pd> giggles-
[Nov 29-07 0:14:2]Daos <pd> no comment
[Nov 29-07 0:14:28]Amun <pd> muy interesante
[Nov 29-07 1:41:19]Daos <pd> what is this build you are doing with ironman?
[Nov 29-07 1:41:31]Nulvect <pd> it only turns on coming from the other way
[Nov 29-07 1:41:45]Daos <pd> what the hell? that is weird...
[Dec 2-07 22:39:29]Amun <pd> and ill see it over here :)
[Dec 2-07 22:40:1]<pd> Amun smiles
[Dec 2-07 22:59:31]Stormbringer <pd> try harder, make better!
[Jan 18-08 17:28:55]Amun <pd> yes Sir?
[Jan 18-08 17:29:5]Amun <pd> ok what can i do? yes i can
[Jan 18-08 17:29:33]Amun <pd> got an error
[Jan 18-08 17:29:43]Amun <pd> bad argument 1 to call_other()
[Jan 18-08 17:30:21]Amun <pd> ok
[Jan 18-08 17:30:57]Amun <pd> ok..it's done on me..need you?
[Jan 18-08 17:31:25]Amun <pd> ok
[Jan 18-08 17:31:35]Amun <pd> done
[Feb 20-08 22:41:15]Nulvect <pd> yeah I saw it
[Feb 20-08 22:41:51]Nulvect <pd> I seriously need to find a way to not show passwords in error msgs...
[Feb 20-08 22:42:29]Nulvect <pd> you do anything like change your race without doing new_body??
[Feb 20-08 22:42:41]Nulvect <pd> in the error output it includes the arguments to the functions that were being run
[Feb 20-08 22:42:45]Nulvect <pd> so yes, it showed it in there
[Feb 20-08 22:44:57]Nulvect <pd> ok try logging in now
[Feb 20-08 22:52:16]Nulvect <pd> bah
[Feb 20-08 22:52:20]Nulvect <pd> I did a new_body on you
[Feb 20-08 22:53:12]Nulvect <pd> what I have to do is get it to save the change...
[Mar 16-08 0:14:11]Nulvect <pd> just please don't put it on newbie or OOC like some people like to do, heh
[May 9-08 14:37:32]Nulvect <pd> mmmm, yummy
[May 11-08 12:0:47]Amun <pd> you over there?
[May 11-08 12:0:57]Amun <pd> if so i'll come that way
[May 28-08 22:31:52]Amun <pd> line
[May 29-08 1:22:28]Nulvect <pd> yes you can
[Jul 15-08 0:6:35]Pyro <pd> lol
[Jul 15-08 0:12:24]Nulvect <pd> all of us can hear you, you know :P
[Jul 15-08 0:12:48]Amun <pd> um what am i?
[Jul 15-08 0:12:52]Amun <pd> chopped liver?
[Jul 15-08 0:12:54]Amun <pd> i wized you
[Jul 15-08 0:13:38]Amun <pd> not when you said that i wasnt, i was unidle
[Jul 15-08 0:22:25]Pyro <pd> that worked
[Jul 15-08 18:4:22]Pyro <pd> =p
[Jul 15-08 18:5:4]Amun <pd> i didn't see that...
[Jul 15-08 18:7:34]Pyro <pd> yeah I think you're allowed to put money on them
[Jul 15-08 18:7:46]Pyro <pd> but I guess that's just me
[Jul 15-08 18:8:12]Amun <pd> i think it's just your discreation
[Jul 15-08 18:9:4]Amun <pd> this is true vian
[Jul 15-08 18:9:34]Amun <pd> got to go make dinner
[Jul 15-08 18:9:36]Amun <pd> later
[Jul 15-08 18:9:38]Pyro <pd> seeya
[Jul 15-08 18:10:48]Pyro <pd> I don't think you can
[Jul 15-08 18:14:6]Pyro <pd> *shrug* you know more than I do there
[Jul 15-08 18:14:22]Pyro <pd> try it out
[Jul 15-08 18:24:20]Pyro <pd> I don't suppose you would know what directory bboard.h is in, or what file I would need to edit to set all my boards as read without spamming myself?
[Jul 15-08 18:25:28]Pyro <pd> I just see directories and *.c files in /std
[Jul 15-08 19:14:57]Pyro <pd> man, I hate chasing down #include files
[Jul 15-08 19:15:7]Pyro <pd> this mob uses #include <shadow.h>
[Jul 15-08 19:15:11]Pyro <pd> and I don't know where that is
[Jul 15-08 19:15:48]Pyro <pd> wouldn't you have the same problem with inherit? finding where it's inheriting from
[Jul 15-08 19:16:4]Pyro <pd> there's an inherit_list?
[Jul 15-08 19:28:4]Pyro <pd> thanks cenn, it was in /include/domains
[Jul 15-08 22:23:24]Nulvect <pd> some day I'll fix it so we can start this line from main port...
[Jul 16-08 22:10:28]Pyro <pd> you know how you can add_pre_exit_function()? What's the syntax to remove it?
[Jul 16-08 22:10:58]Nulvect <pd> more /std/room/exits.c
[Jul 16-08 22:11:48]Nulvect <pd> haha, it's a static function, that's probably not the best idea :P
[Jul 16-08 22:12:50]Nulvect <pd> static means you can't do roomob->remove_pre_exit_function("east"); , you have to have remove_pre_exit_function("east"); in the actual room code for that room
[Jul 16-08 22:13:40]Pyro <pd> I was planning on adding it to the remove_door() function in vault.c
[Jul 16-08 22:14:22]Nulvect <pd> ah
[Jul 17-08 16:1:14]Ironman <pd> works
[Jul 17-08 16:1:48]Pyro <pd> I was wondering if you could help me out with something.... I want to use something like present("monster"), but I want to be able to actually return the object itself
[Jul 17-08 16:1:56]Pyro <pd> what function would I use for that?
[Jul 17-08 16:2:18]Pyro <pd> so I could do like get_object_from_this_environment("monster")->delete();
[Jul 17-08 16:2:30]Pyro <pd> thanks
[Jul 17-08 18:59:41]Pyro <pd> test
[Jul 18-08 12:42:33]Nulvect <pd> oh, no no
[Jul 18-08 12:42:53]Nulvect <pd> if (this_player()->is_player()) { this_player()->add_hp(blah); write(blah); say(blah); }
[Jul 18-08 12:43:27]Nulvect <pd> that say() text should be more informative, it would look odd if someone entered and it said that
[Jul 18-08 12:44:31]Nulvect <pd> that sounds just fine
[Jul 18-08 12:45:57]Nulvect <pd> hmmm, very difficult
[Jul 18-08 12:46:23]Nulvect <pd> you could make a fake exit in the other room and do it all from there
[Jul 18-08 12:59:52]Nulvect <pd> yes you can inherit mount
[Jul 18-08 12:59:56]Nulvect <pd> and it will work as expected
[Jul 18-08 13:0:20]Nulvect <pd> I think MOUNT is not 'monster', by default... let me check
[Jul 18-08 13:0:30]Nulvect <pd> use "cure me"
[Jul 19-08 12:38:54]Pyro <pd> "update" works fine. "update here" kills me
[Jul 19-08 12:39:2]Pyro <pd> it booted both you and me off main
[Jul 19-08 12:39:42]Pyro <pd> well, regardless of the reason
[Jul 19-08 12:39:46]Pyro <pd> I have to stop doing it =p
[Jul 19-08 12:40:23]Pyro <pd> I tried doing it on builders and got a huge lag spike
[Jul 19-08 12:40:35]Pyro <pd> could have been because somebady was logging on here though
[Jul 19-08 12:45:2]Pyro <pd> come to me
[Jul 19-08 12:45:28]Pyro <pd> coooome to me =p
[Jul 19-08 12:45:36]<pd> Pyro moves you
[Jul 19-08 12:45:38]Pyro <pd> lol
[Jul 19-08 12:50:6]Pyro <pd> now, it's add_action(FUNCTION, COMMAND) and not the other way around, right?
[Jul 19-08 12:59:36]Ironman <pd> theres a man file over here for it
[Jul 19-08 13:0:30]Ironman <pd> sscanf(input,"$s $i whatever",Var1,var2,var3);
[Jul 19-08 13:0:50]Ironman <pd> i used it alot for ques
[Jul 19-08 13:0:54]Ironman <pd> i used it alot for quez
[Jul 19-08 13:1:28]Ironman <pd> lol wrong port :P
[Jul 19-08 13:2:54]Pyro <pd> test
[Jul 19-08 13:3:0]Pyro <pd> oh wow
[Jul 19-08 13:3:16]Pyro <pd> so then how am I supposed to insert a ! at the front of a file? =p
[Jul 19-08 13:9:8]Ironman <pd> thats cause the ! is a command within ed()
[Jul 19-08 13:9:44]Pyro <pd> what exactly is an event?
[Jul 19-08 13:9:54]Pyro <pd> !hello  returns   hello: Event not found.
[Jul 19-08 13:13:40]Nulvect <pd> it's for your history
[Jul 19-08 13:14:4]Pyro <pd> !hello  returns   hello: Event not found.
[Jul 19-08 13:14:8]Pyro <pd> I see
[Jul 19-08 13:14:18]Pyro <pd> so I can recall things in my history
[Jul 19-08 13:14:30]Pyro <pd> test
[Jul 19-08 13:14:44]Pyro <pd> I see
[Jul 19-08 13:15:2]Pyro <pd> I see
[Jul 19-08 13:15:10]Pyro <pd> damn, !70..72 didn't work
[Jul 19-08 13:18:45]Ironman <pd> ![70..72]
[Jul 19-08 13:20:37]Pyro <pd> i'm getting close to having doors fully functional
[Jul 19-08 13:20:41]Pyro <pd> I can almost taste it
[Jul 19-08 13:21:9]Nulvect <pd> cool
[Jul 19-08 13:21:15]Pyro <pd> nul! come to me
[Jul 19-08 13:21:21]Pyro <pd> I have a small example in
[Jul 19-08 13:21:21]Ironman <pd> good yer awake :)
[Jul 19-08 13:21:27]Nulvect <pd> just for a bit
[Jul 19-08 13:26:54]Nulvect <pd> so, I'd really like it if we could keep all code stuff off the main lines
[Jul 19-08 13:27:34]Pyro <pd> you mean pd too?
[Jul 19-08 13:27:34]Nulvect <pd> sometimes cenn or someone starts talking about it and we should just tell them to stop, or answer them in tells
[Jul 19-08 13:27:48]Nulvect <pd> this line and imm lines are fine :P
[Jul 19-08 13:28:2]Nulvect <pd> but newbie, OOC, etc should be code-free
[Jul 19-08 13:28:12]Pyro <pd> can you give me an example of unacceptable conversations?
[Jul 19-08 13:28:28]Nulvect <pd> it kind of detracts from playing with people talking about call me;set_race or if (this_player()->query_hp())
[Jul 19-08 13:29:50]Nulvect <pd> general programming is fine just not too specific on pd stuff
[Jul 19-08 13:30:6]Nulvect <pd> if people want to see code they'll make a builder, hehe
[Jul 19-08 13:30:14]Pyro <pd> hehe, alright
[Jul 19-08 13:30:28]Pyro <pd> so if a player talks about it, tell them our new policy and respond to them in tells?
[Jul 19-08 13:30:56]Nulvect <pd> it's not an official policy
[Jul 19-08 13:31:14]Nulvect <pd> I just think it affects how non-coders feel about playing
[Jul 19-08 13:31:50]Nulvect <pd> if you want to answer a code question just use tells so it's not on newbie
[Jul 19-08 13:32:6]Pyro <pd> alright
[Jul 21-08 19:6:55]Pyro <pd> damn lag
[Jul 23-08 19:7:49]Pyro <pd> i'll be on here ironman
[Jul 25-08 13:52:44]Nulvect <pd> we be open
[Jul 25-08 13:52:52]Nulvect <pd> uh, mateys.. arr.
[Jul 26-08 15:10:57]Ironman <pd> over here
[Jul 26-08 15:11:7]Ironman <pd> over here
[Jul 26-08 15:21:45]Pyro <pd> zmg
[Aug 2-08 16:14:27]Pyro <pd> yo
[Aug 2-08 16:15:5]Pyro <pd> ah, you're idle over there too
[Aug 2-08 17:14:51]Pyro <pd> I'm here ironman
[Aug 2-08 17:47:50]Pyro <pd> so what are you working on that uses it?
[Aug 9-08 17:54:26]Pyro <pd> blargh, returning a mixed gave me a giant, giant error
[Aug 9-08 17:54:34]Pyro <pd> so returning an object is apparently out of the question
[Aug 9-08 17:54:58]Pyro <pd> for query_exit
[Aug 9-08 17:56:22]Pyro <pd> Expected: string Got: /d/events/dragonaug2008/rooms/battleroom2#4088.
[Aug 9-08 17:56:50]Pyro <pd> the mud just isn't set up to work that way
[Aug 9-08 17:56:52]Ironman <pd> ya cause exits are expecting a string
[Aug 9-08 17:56:52]Pyro <pd> everything is messing up
[Aug 9-08 17:56:58]Pyro <pd> the mapper daemon, exits.c
[Aug 9-08 17:57:24]Ironman <pd> personally..... i would make custom ways to move them around
[Aug 30-08 14:13:59]Nulvect <pd> *boom*
[Aug 30-08 14:14:25]Stormbringer <pd> eh?
[Aug 30-08 14:15:53]Ironman <pd> i can see this line on the builders port stormy.... thats what i was talkin about
[Aug 30-08 14:16:7]Stormbringer <pd> nod
[Aug 30-08 14:16:23]Stormbringer <pd> was refering to *boo* =P
[Aug 30-08 14:16:29]Stormbringer <pd> err boom even
[Aug 30-08 14:59:48]Nulvect <pd> ironman, that is how you'd have to do that, yes
[Aug 30-08 15:0:38]Pyro <pd> Using the PD line on this side should open the network connection too
[Aug 30-08 15:0:48]Pyro <pd> would that be a huge hassle to do, or is it a simple function call?
[Aug 30-08 15:0:56]Nulvect <pd> I don't know
[Sep 27-08 13:55:43]Stormbringer <pd> =P
[Oct 2-08 1:57:14]Nulvect <pd> I agree
[Oct 2-08 1:57:50]Nulvect <pd> ugh... I don't know why that gets sent to players... it should only be visible on the shell
[Oct 2-08 1:57:54]Nulvect <pd> it's not that
[Oct 2-08 1:58:10]Nulvect <pd> yeah
[Oct 2-08 1:59:42]Nulvect <pd> tell me, how would you normally say you have two of something which normally is pluralized, like scissors??
[Oct 2-08 2:0:10]Nulvect <pd> exactly
[Oct 2-08 2:0:20]Nulvect <pd> so make it "a set of crystaline claws"
[Oct 2-08 2:0:32]Nulvect <pd> and maybe pluralize will work correctly
[Oct 2-08 2:0:48]Nulvect <pd> or not.. bleh
[Oct 2-08 2:1:32]Nulvect <pd> you're grouping a bunch of them into a single unit, so you need some adjective to describe this unit
[Oct 2-08 2:1:46]Nulvect <pd> or noun
[Oct 2-08 2:2:8]Nulvect <pd> I may add something like a set_plural("sets of crystalline claws") so you can do that easily
[Oct 2-08 2:2:44]Nulvect <pd> yeah it's not set up to do that right now
[Oct 2-08 2:2:50]Nulvect <pd> I'll add it to my list though
[Oct 2-08 2:3:14]Nulvect <pd> ah, it's already on my list, heh
[Oct 2-08 2:3:54]Nulvect <pd> at the moment your best bet is to rename it
[Oct 2-08 2:4:8]Nulvect <pd> or just live with it, and it'll be fixed eventually
[Oct 2-08 2:5:20]Nulvect <pd> heh
[Oct 2-08 2:6:16]Nulvect <pd> nod, hasta
[Dec 31-08 13:41:5]Ironman <pd> on builders if anyone wants/needs me
[Apr 14-09 14:3:22]Nulvect <pd> it connects to main port
[Apr 14-09 14:10:28]Nulvect <pd> nope, what do you need??
[Apr 15-09 3:4:47]Nulvect <pd> I'll give you a more thorough rundown of commands and stuff tomorrow evening
[Apr 16-09 19:25:39]Nulvect <pd> hey
[Apr 16-09 19:25:43]Nulvect <pd> nope
[May 27-09 23:2:2]Nulvect <pd> ?
[May 27-09 23:50:38]Nulvect <pd> need something??
[May 28-09 1:5:48]Nulvect <pd> oh, no, that's a weird problem with the driver over there
[May 28-09 1:5:58]Nulvect <pd> sometimes a player will see debug messages that should be going to the shell
[Aug 16-09 17:18:6]Stormbringer <pd> I am pretty open
[Aug 16-09 17:18:16]Stormbringer <pd> so long as I get to help ;)
[Aug 16-09 17:42:36]Stormbringer <pd> nope
[Aug 16-09 17:42:40]Stormbringer <pd> not at all
[Aug 16-09 23:55:11]Nulvect <pd> que??
[Aug 22-09 19:28:36]Pyro <pd> what on? mail system?
[Aug 22-09 19:28:40]Pyro <pd> oh, containers?
[Aug 22-09 19:33:30]Pyro <pd> do you generally work by outlining first, revising until you have something you like, then programming?
[Aug 22-09 19:35:30]Pyro <pd> ah, flowcharts makes sense for something technical like that
[Aug 22-09 19:36:32]Pyro <pd> I still haven't finished working on the newbie area because I honestly have no clue where to start on the damn thing.. I have a good amount of the details down, but when I try to work on it, it all seems so abstract. The only way I can think to start it is to just start writing exactly what the player will be seeing when he logs in
[Aug 22-09 19:36:38]Pyro <pd> how would you recommend I outline it?
[Aug 22-09 19:37:10]Stormbringer <pd> start with a story
[Aug 22-09 19:37:26]Stormbringer <pd> make it an adventure/quest
[Aug 22-09 19:38:48]Stormbringer <pd> isn't a true area
[Aug 22-09 19:39:6]Stormbringer <pd> it is a newbie tutorial/school
[Aug 22-09 19:41:32]Stormbringer <pd> well that was just my description, I do not want it to be a school
[Aug 22-09 19:41:50]Stormbringer <pd> I want it to be a quest and tut mixed otgether
[Aug 22-09 19:41:56]Stormbringer <pd> together even
[Aug 22-09 19:42:8]Pyro <pd> hehe, yeah, It has to be a bit... err... well, less interactive. More guiding, as it will include things like how to move
[Aug 22-09 19:42:14]Stormbringer <pd> those mud schools are always so friggin boring and redundunt
[Aug 22-09 19:42:36]Stormbringer <pd> seen
[Aug 22-09 19:42:42]Stormbringer <pd> it and played with it
[Aug 22-09 19:42:42]Pyro <pd> I've seen him, he's the turtle, right?
[Aug 22-09 19:46:16]Pyro <pd> back!
[Aug 22-09 19:47:0]Stormbringer <pd> too much scripting not enough doing though, I want it to be fun and adventurous, it has to pull non mudders into the game to stay and try us out
[Aug 22-09 19:47:52]Stormbringer <pd> that is the whole idea, to get non mudders involved and playing before they realize they are getting sucked into gamming ;)
[Aug 22-09 19:47:58]Pyro <pd> hehe
[Aug 22-09 19:49:32]Stormbringer <pd> we are attempting to combine the two really, something easy to grip that teaches as you play
[Aug 22-09 19:51:22]Stormbringer <pd> eh, mudding is all about grinding, always has been and probably always will be
[Aug 22-09 19:51:30]Stormbringer <pd> but I agree to an extent
[Aug 22-09 19:51:52]Pyro <pd> hey ironman, did you ever get a chance to see the area I made for the dragon quest?
[Aug 22-09 19:51:54]Stormbringer <pd> tis why I had the remort system redone so a player could remort without penalty and try something new
[Aug 22-09 19:52:36]Pyro <pd> I made an area where the main idea was to have players get the idea right and not have to worry about syntax.. I have like 16 different things you can type to get from one stage to another.. and people still would stand around with the right idea in mind and not actually able to figure out the correct method
[Aug 22-09 19:52:56]Stormbringer <pd> I am more than happy to discuss and implement any ideas that make this place more fun to play Iman, you should know that by now :)
[Aug 22-09 19:53:14]Pyro <pd> the problem isn't the commands actually, they would have the right idea ("I need to break this ice") but they couldn't come up with a valid way to do it
[Aug 22-09 19:53:24]Pyro <pd> although the commands is part of it
[Aug 22-09 19:53:48]Stormbringer <pd> well tis part of what you are working on yeah??
[Aug 22-09 19:53:52]Stormbringer <pd> :p
[Aug 22-09 19:55:18]Stormbringer <pd> one step at a time ;)
[Aug 22-09 19:55:48]Stormbringer <pd> do you guys know how long I have wanted to expand rangers into something great?
[Aug 22-09 19:56:2]Stormbringer <pd> been trying since year one =P
[Aug 22-09 19:56:16]Stormbringer <pd> they are getting there, in thier own way
[Aug 22-09 19:56:50]Stormbringer <pd> that would be a blacksmith
[Aug 22-09 19:57:12]Stormbringer <pd> the command is already there for bows and arrows, else it was once
[Aug 22-09 21:6:10]Stormbringer <pd> wee :)
[Aug 22-09 21:13:26]Pyro <pd> ?
[Aug 22-09 21:13:56]Nulvect <pd> chicken
[Aug 22-09 21:14:22]Pyro <pd> ?
[Aug 22-09 21:14:30]Nulvect <pd> oh, ironman, I already have plans for multi-person spells and abilities
[Aug 22-09 21:14:40]Nulvect <pd> though I haven't started on the implementation yet
[Aug 22-09 21:15:54]Nulvect <pd> is this intended for projectile weapons??
[Aug 22-09 21:16:56]Nulvect <pd> hmm
[Aug 22-09 21:17:12]Nulvect <pd> guess I should figure out a good way to transfer players' skills around then
[Aug 22-09 21:17:52]Nulvect <pd> I really want to make a polearm skill for spear type weapons, and put bows and all projectiles into the projectile skill..
[Aug 22-09 21:18:2]Nulvect <pd> then remove the ranged skill, as it's redundant
[Aug 22-09 21:18:32]Nulvect <pd> hmmmmm
[Aug 22-09 21:18:54]Nulvect <pd> that sounds odd
[Aug 22-09 21:19:38]Nulvect <pd> why do players need to care if their backpack has 1 or 10 pockets though??
[Aug 22-09 21:20:18]Nulvect <pd> and if you want to put things inside a weapon or armour you can dual-inherit CONTAINER or BAG alongside WEAPON or ARMOUR
[Aug 22-09 21:22:20]Nulvect <pd> check out /std/backpack.c on main port if you need a reference
[Aug 22-09 23:9:22]Pyro <pd> heya
[Aug 23-09 1:34:22]Pyro <pd> hi
[Aug 23-09 1:35:28]Pyro <pd> I don't see him
[Aug 23-09 1:35:32]Pyro <pd> did you need something?
[Aug 23-09 1:36:52]Pyro <pd> ah, alright
[Aug 23-09 23:7:26]Pyro <pd> heya
[Aug 23-09 23:8:22]Pyro <pd> lol
[Aug 23-09 23:8:26]Pyro <pd> you can always log on both at the same time
[Aug 23-09 23:8:38]Stormbringer <pd> most of us double log ;)
[Aug 23-09 23:8:48]Pyro <pd> nah, you can
[Aug 23-09 23:9:12]Stormbringer <pd> nah, so long as you aare still a player here it is fine :)-
[Aug 23-09 23:10:44]Stormbringer <pd> doesn't have to be exactly 100 or more, just use it as a goal :)
[Aug 23-09 23:11:38]Stormbringer <pd> builders used to be a pretty active place...
[Aug 23-09 23:11:58]Stormbringer <pd> this mud used to be a pretty active place...
[Aug 23-09 23:12:12]Stormbringer <pd> :)
[Aug 23-09 23:12:12]Pyro <pd> 100 rooms is going to be huge :o
[Aug 23-09 23:12:40]Stormbringer <pd> heh, really?
[Aug 23-09 23:14:0]Stormbringer <pd> well, do what you think is good dude. If you feel you can do the area in 60-75 go for it
[Aug 23-09 23:15:52]Stormbringer <pd> we are not set in stone, it really is just a goal number
[Aug 23-09 23:16:22]Pyro <pd> it's not that bad actually, once you start making a map, if you have a general idea of what landmark you want your area to have and make the map aronud that, you'll find the room number skyrocket pretty fast
[Aug 23-09 23:16:30]Stormbringer <pd> it was used to encourage people to do large town, with surrounding forest, beach, or whatever
[Aug 23-09 23:18:12]Stormbringer <pd> if you want to make something like 30 rooms of frozen mountian caves or whatever let me know, I can show you a virtual room system that work wonders for repeating rooms
[Aug 23-09 23:18:36]Stormbringer <pd> allows you to put them out fast without repeating the descriptions over and over
[Aug 23-09 23:18:36]Pyro <pd> not every room has to be an outstanding work of art. Although that would be nice, a lot of players just like having an area with an interesting layout and things to kill, rather than deep room descriptions in each room
[Aug 24-09 13:49:56]Stormbringer <pd> hey hey
[Aug 24-09 13:50:8]Stormbringer <pd> how are you today?
[Aug 24-09 14:22:18]Pyro <pd> sorry, was washing my car
[Aug 24-09 16:28:10]Stormbringer <pd> hola :)
[Aug 24-09 21:14:54]Pyro <pd> heya!
[Aug 24-09 21:14:58]Pyro <pd> how's the area coming along?
[Aug 24-09 21:15:4]Pyro <pd> got your map worked out?
[Aug 24-09 21:48:54]Nulvect <pd> woo
[Aug 25-09 14:22:6]Stormbringer <pd> hola!
[Aug 25-09 14:22:12]Stormbringer <pd> how goes?
[Aug 25-09 14:23:14]Stormbringer <pd> ooo
[Aug 25-09 14:23:24]Stormbringer <pd> that sounds like fun :D
[Aug 25-09 14:23:38]Stormbringer <pd> been too long since I went to a concert :(
[Aug 25-09 14:26:24]Stormbringer <pd> sounds fun too
[Aug 27-09 3:16:5]Stormbringer <pd> hiya
[Aug 27-09 12:12:7]Nulvect <pd> hello
[Aug 28-09 3:8:56]Pyro <pd> what's up?
[Aug 28-09 3:9:56]Pyro <pd> I think it's  /log/errors/YOURNAME
[Aug 28-09 3:10:10]Pyro <pd> just type:   tail /log/errors/doulos
[Aug 28-09 3:11:19]Nulvect <pd> unless you're doing something very complex, using the update command should show you the error
[Aug 28-09 3:16:53]Nulvect <pd> some day I need to fix that bug
[Aug 28-09 3:27:53]Nulvect <pd> pyro you still over there??
[Aug 28-09 3:28:3]Nulvect <pd> can you test something for me??
[Aug 28-09 3:28:13]Nulvect <pd> nah
[Aug 28-09 3:28:21]Nulvect <pd> go to www.primaldarkness.com/fmud/
[Aug 28-09 3:28:33]Nulvect <pd> it gives me a blank screen and never logs in or anything
[Aug 28-09 3:29:21]Nulvect <pd> hmmmmmm
[Aug 28-09 3:29:29]Nulvect <pd> security??
[Aug 28-09 3:30:3]Nulvect <pd> weird
[Aug 28-09 14:51:9]Stormbringer <pd> hiya :)
[Aug 28-09 16:41:29]Pyro <pd> heya
[Aug 28-09 16:41:31]Pyro <pd> what's up?
[Aug 28-09 16:41:55]Pyro <pd> I Think he's here
[Aug 28-09 16:44:21]Pyro <pd> he's 5 minutes idle, I think he'll be back soon if he's afk
[Aug 28-09 16:44:25]Pyro <pd> but he may not be
[Aug 28-09 17:7:29]Stormbringer <pd> Doh!
[Aug 28-09 22:32:54]Pyro <pd> evening
[Aug 28-09 22:32:54]Stormbringer <pd> hola :)
[Aug 28-09 22:33:0]Pyro <pd> ah, stormy's here!
[Aug 28-09 22:34:12]Stormbringer <pd> sure, be right there
[Aug 28-09 23:38:58]Pyro <pd> you guys still over there?
[Aug 29-09 3:15:26]Nulvect <pd> hello
[Aug 29-09 3:18:26]Nulvect <pd> hmm, pretty quiet
[Aug 29-09 3:18:34]Nulvect <pd> just trying to set some stuff up on the server
[Aug 29-09 3:20:40]Nulvect <pd> how's your stuff going??
[Aug 29-09 3:26:46]Nulvect <pd> oh, I have a solution
[Aug 29-09 3:27:16]Nulvect <pd> still there??
[Aug 29-09 23:20:17]Stormbringer <pd> hey
[Aug 29-09 23:25:45]Stormbringer <pd> menat a builders board onhere ;)
[Aug 29-09 23:25:53]Stormbringer <pd> on there type wizlounge
[Aug 29-09 23:26:3]Stormbringer <pd> takes you to the wizards boards
[Aug 29-09 23:28:35]Stormbringer <pd> been working on a website update
[Aug 31-09 15:47:35]Stormbringer <pd> still on?
[Sep 1-09 10:59:3]Nulvect <pd> yo
[Sep 1-09 11:0:45]Nulvect <pd> definitely happier than monday
[Sep 1-09 11:3:29]Nulvect <pd> ah, well that's not so good then
[Sep 1-09 19:42:42]Stormbringer <pd> :)
[Sep 1-09 19:43:2]Stormbringer <pd> anyone around that can see this line?
[Sep 7-09 20:59:53]Nulvect <pd> yeah
[Sep 7-09 21:0:1]Stormbringer <pd> though it could take two tries to get it to work
[Sep 7-09 21:2:15]Nulvect <pd> hi talgard, how's it going
[Sep 7-09 21:3:27]Nulvect <pd> yeah, lots of docs, a few are even up to date
[Sep 7-09 21:3:43]Nulvect <pd> if you need anything complicated added into an area just let me know
[Sep 8-09 16:39:50]Stormbringer <pd> eh?
[Sep 8-09 16:39:58]Stormbringer <pd> got a silly answer
[Sep 8-09 16:40:30]Stormbringer <pd> id
[Sep 8-09 16:40:38]Stormbringer <pd> it looks for the id I believe
[Sep 8-09 16:43:38]Pyro <pd> the name of the file would be WEP"fangs"
[Sep 8-09 16:43:44]Pyro <pd> where WEP should be the path name
[Sep 8-09 16:44:24]Pyro <pd> yep-
[Sep 8-09 16:44:30]Pyro <pd> like    new("/wizards/pyro/kitten.c")->move(environment(this_player()));
[Sep 8-09 16:44:42]Pyro <pd> or    new(MOBS"kitten.c")->move(environment(this_player()));
[Sep 8-09 16:45:10]Stormbringer <pd> there isn't one right now
[Sep 8-09 16:45:16]Stormbringer <pd> that i know of
[Sep 8-09 16:45:32]Stormbringer <pd> but if you want to email the files to me I can ftp em into your directory
[Sep 8-09 16:45:42]Stormbringer <pd> pack em all up in a zip
[Sep 8-09 16:46:44]Stormbringer <pd> zolenia?
[Sep 8-09 16:47:14]Stormbringer <pd> yeah, tis fine
[Sep 8-09 16:47:38]Stormbringer <pd> just didn't know what you were refering to
[Sep 8-09 16:48:24]Stormbringer <pd> well we normally only use virtual for repetitive areas like caves or forest]
[Sep 8-09 16:48:54]Stormbringer <pd> anything more like a town or kingdom we would hope would be real rooms
[Sep 8-09 16:49:14]Stormbringer <pd> though I am toying with building an entire area out of virtual right now =P
[Sep 8-09 16:49:40]Stormbringer <pd> so if you can make it work convincingly, more power to you :)
[Sep 8-09 16:49:52]Stormbringer <pd> kk
[Sep 8-09 16:50:6]Stormbringer <pd> well it is going in north of roston, so you know
[Sep 8-09 16:50:38]Stormbringer <pd> not where you thought?
[Sep 8-09 16:50:54]Stormbringer <pd> yes, it NEEDS to be underground
[Sep 8-09 16:51:8]Stormbringer <pd> and deep
[Sep 8-09 16:51:40]Stormbringer <pd> I am wanting the entrance to be in the drow camps
[Sep 8-09 16:51:46]Stormbringer <pd> camp even
[Sep 8-09 16:51:50]Stormbringer <pd> or near it
[Sep 8-09 16:51:58]Stormbringer <pd> maybe past it to the north a little
[Sep 8-09 16:52:6]Stormbringer <pd> no idea yet
[Sep 8-09 16:52:24]Stormbringer <pd> all that was pushed back a bit with the newbie thing pyro and I are working on
[Sep 8-09 16:53:2]Stormbringer <pd> sounds fine
[Sep 8-09 16:53:52]Stormbringer <pd> the drow camp will be the invasion force from Zolenia
[Sep 8-09 16:54:14]Stormbringer <pd> cause they are mad the dwarves are setting up close to Zolenia
[Sep 8-09 16:54:32]Stormbringer <pd> Roston will become a dawrven mining and logging town
[Sep 8-09 16:54:42]Stormbringer <pd> that is about 2/3 done
[Sep 8-09 16:59:48]Stormbringer <pd> no, just special mobs should suto
[Sep 8-09 16:59:52]Stormbringer <pd> auto even
[Sep 8-09 17:0:12]Stormbringer <pd> in fact I got plans to rework purg again because of that
[Sep 8-09 17:0:26]Stormbringer <pd> if no one playes and exps there, it is not worth having on the mud
[Sep 8-09 17:0:46]Stormbringer <pd> no more "killer" areas
[Sep 8-09 17:0:52]Stormbringer <pd> challenging and hard are fine
[Sep 8-09 17:1:22]Stormbringer <pd> but built to kill players, not gonna happen here anymore, they are a waste of time and resources
[Sep 8-09 17:4:52]Pyro <pd> you wouldn't do   this_player()->query_race() == "!demon". the type would be "demon". You would want to do   !this_player()->query_race() == "demon"   or   this_player()->query_race() != "demon"
[Sep 8-09 18:20:34]Stormbringer <pd> looking into it
[Sep 8-09 18:21:2]Stormbringer <pd> shouldn't be, it goes by filename
[Sep 8-09 18:22:46]Stormbringer <pd> what is your mob cap at?
[Sep 8-09 18:29:32]Stormbringer <pd> sounds like you have a problem with a mod
[Sep 8-09 18:29:48]Stormbringer <pd> are all the filenames in the server file right?
[Sep 8-09 18:35:12]Stormbringer <pd> no idea
[Sep 8-09 18:35:20]Stormbringer <pd> thing has always been a littl wonky
[Sep 8-09 18:37:56]Stormbringer <pd> oh
[Sep 8-09 18:38:2]Stormbringer <pd> on the randomness
[Sep 8-09 18:38:28]Stormbringer <pd> once ou get 30+ rooms in, you will not notice that many rooms that do not load mobs, believe me ;)
[Sep 8-09 18:38:54]Stormbringer <pd> I think it is like 1 out of every 25 or 30 might only load 1 or no mobs
[Sep 8-09 18:39:18]Stormbringer <pd> single room is not a good test
[Sep 8-09 18:40:0]Stormbringer <pd> never looked for one on a mac
[Sep 8-09 18:40:14]Stormbringer <pd> :(
[Sep 8-09 18:40:38]Stormbringer <pd> oooo, that would be cool =P
[Sep 8-09 18:45:24]<pd> Stormbringer doesn't have a mac
[Sep 8-09 18:46:16]Stormbringer <pd> oh
[Sep 8-09 18:46:22]Stormbringer <pd> ask pyro
[Sep 8-09 18:47:28]Stormbringer <pd> going afk
[Sep 8-09 19:8:21]Pyro <pd> I've never used a mapping program like that
[Sep 8-09 19:8:57]Pyro <pd> I was on a mud once that let you make an area just by moving the way you wanted to, it would automatically make the exit and new room for you
[Sep 8-09 20:56:47]Stormbringer <pd> no, it is just messed up I think
[Sep 8-09 20:57:15]Stormbringer <pd> even when it was written it was a down and dirty way to serv up and area quick
[Sep 8-09 20:57:37]Pyro <pd> so what mapper did you end up using?
[Sep 8-09 20:57:53]Stormbringer <pd> it needs some serious work to make it a great system I am just not willing to have someone spend time fixing it since it works
[Sep 8-09 20:58:31]Stormbringer <pd> no idea
[Sep 8-09 21:0:3]Stormbringer <pd> copying the std over from here right now, gimme a sec
[Sep 8-09 21:17:55]Stormbringer <pd> 160+ rooms, not too shabby
[Sep 8-09 21:18:5]Stormbringer <pd> that server file better be awesome =P
[Sep 8-09 21:18:55]Stormbringer <pd> sure ytou want to put drow in it?
[Sep 8-09 21:19:19]Stormbringer <pd> none of these mobs move I hope
[Sep 8-09 21:40:29]Stormbringer <pd> :)
[Sep 8-09 21:40:59]Stormbringer <pd> you wish
[Sep 8-09 22:6:55]Stormbringer <pd> for furture reference
[Sep 8-09 22:7:33]Stormbringer <pd> if you don't need to set night stuff on the server then you can rmove the whole set_night section
[Sep 8-09 22:8:7]Stormbringer <pd> well you would be wrong ;)
[Sep 8-09 22:8:29]Stormbringer <pd> for outdoor rooms we require a set_long and a set_night_long
[Sep 8-09 22:8:47]Stormbringer <pd> but that is only for outdoor rooms
[Sep 8-09 22:9:5]Stormbringer <pd> we hope to eventually get the whole mud up to speed on that ;)
[Sep 8-09 22:9:39]Stormbringer <pd> kk
[Sep 8-09 22:9:45]Stormbringer <pd> going through mobs right now
[Sep 8-09 22:10:49]Stormbringer <pd> how long would it take you to run through mobs and randomizer their level by 6?
[Sep 8-09 22:11:23]Stormbringer <pd> instead of 40 do 35+random(6)
[Sep 8-09 22:11:39]Stormbringer <pd> yeah
[Sep 8-09 22:11:59]Stormbringer <pd> kk
[Sep 8-09 22:12:13]Stormbringer <pd> yeah
[Sep 8-09 22:15:5]Stormbringer <pd> kk
[Sep 8-09 22:15:19]Stormbringer <pd> will that have the new server in it?
[Sep 8-09 22:15:29]Stormbringer <pd> or do I need to get that from the mud?
[Sep 8-09 22:15:47]Stormbringer <pd> whatever, just wante dot make sure I got the right one
[Sep 8-09 22:24:37]Stormbringer <pd> hrm
[Sep 8-09 22:25:33]Stormbringer <pd> drow are only around 50
[Sep 8-09 22:27:5]Stormbringer <pd> dunno yet
[Sep 8-09 22:27:21]Stormbringer <pd> it will be in that are somewhere
[Sep 8-09 22:27:47]Stormbringer <pd> you have a room with the dig thing?
[Sep 8-09 23:19:15]Nulvect <pd> who's araxus??
[Sep 8-09 23:19:45]Stormbringer <pd> brialar
[Sep 8-09 23:19:55]Nulvect <pd> ah, ok
[Sep 8-09 23:20:39]Nulvect <pd> you got all your previous questions sorted out??
[Sep 8-09 23:21:3]Nulvect <pd> new() goes by filename, so new(WEP"blah") loads blah.c from whatever dir is defined as WEP
[Sep 8-09 23:32:43]Stormbringer <pd> still around vian?
[Sep 8-09 23:51:9]Nulvect <pd> void create() { set_server(BLAH); ::create(); set_long(query_long+" Whatever is here."); }
[Sep 8-09 23:51:19]Nulvect <pd> try that... ::create() needs the server set first
[Sep 8-09 23:51:53]Nulvect <pd> well
[Sep 8-09 23:51:57]Nulvect <pd> query_long()+ yeah
[Sep 8-09 23:52:7]Nulvect <pd> and if that still doesn't work do query_long(0)+"
[Sep 10-09 16:43:46]Stormbringer <pd> hrm
[Sep 10-09 16:44:4]Stormbringer <pd> I have a bit of a problem with some of your mob choices
[Sep 10-09 16:44:32]Stormbringer <pd> I don't understand what a golden griffon would be doing in a network of caves
[Sep 10-09 16:44:42]Stormbringer <pd> or a unicorn for that matter
[Sep 10-09 16:45:16]Stormbringer <pd> not as a random mob
[Sep 10-09 16:46:16]Stormbringer <pd> kk
[Sep 10-09 16:46:48]Stormbringer <pd> don't copy too closely from that story line
[Sep 10-09 16:47:0]Stormbringer <pd> kk
[Sep 10-09 16:50:2]Stormbringer <pd> how much damage is that fall doing?
[Sep 10-09 16:59:48]Stormbringer <pd> ok it is in
[Sep 10-09 17:0:4]Stormbringer <pd> it is in near the srow
[Sep 10-09 17:0:10]Stormbringer <pd> drow even
[Sep 10-09 17:0:16]Stormbringer <pd> but not in the camp
[Sep 10-09 17:0:22]Stormbringer <pd> no
[Sep 10-09 17:0:30]Stormbringer <pd> you wanted it changed?
[Sep 10-09 17:2:44]Stormbringer <pd> one more thing
[Sep 10-09 17:3:0]Stormbringer <pd> d not use the word you in room descriptions
[Sep 10-09 17:3:24]Stormbringer <pd> for the falling rooms it will be fine
[Sep 10-09 17:3:34]Stormbringer <pd> but we normally do not allow it
[Sep 10-09 17:3:58]Stormbringer <pd> I know there are alot of older rooms on the mud done with you but I am slowly changing that ;)
[Sep 10-09 17:4:30]Stormbringer <pd> I know exactly which areas need work =P
[Sep 10-09 17:4:48]Stormbringer <pd> lol
[Sep 10-09 17:4:58]Stormbringer <pd> also
[Sep 10-09 17:5:32]Stormbringer <pd> I want to see if we can line up a path from the heart of the drow camp, the generals tent to some place in the city
[Sep 10-09 17:5:40]Stormbringer <pd> it will be hidden
[Sep 10-09 17:6:10]Stormbringer <pd> but we will have to map it carefully so nothing overlaps and everything goes in the right direction
[Sep 10-09 17:6:32]Stormbringer <pd> I want it to a room inside the castle if possible
[Sep 10-09 17:6:56]Stormbringer <pd> we will make it well hidden, a shrotcut for drow officers kinda thing
[Sep 10-09 17:7:48]Stormbringer <pd> yeah
[Sep 10-09 17:7:58]Stormbringer <pd> well no door
[Sep 10-09 17:8:10]Stormbringer <pd> but the secret to opening it will be on the general
[Sep 10-09 17:8:26]Stormbringer <pd> and it will not be openable while she lives...
[Sep 10-09 17:8:42]Stormbringer <pd> or in thew room...
[Sep 10-09 17:8:52]Stormbringer <pd> might even make it a magic portal
[Sep 10-09 17:9:4]Stormbringer <pd> think we will make it a portal
[Sep 10-09 17:9:24]Stormbringer <pd> be much easier =P
[Sep 10-09 17:9:56]Stormbringer <pd> to the outrchambers of the throneroom or something
[Sep 10-09 17:11:34]Stormbringer <pd> nah
[Sep 10-09 17:11:38]Stormbringer <pd> well dunno
[Sep 10-09 17:11:40]Stormbringer <pd> maybe
[Sep 10-09 17:11:54]Stormbringer <pd> you could, make it part of a quest if you want
[Sep 10-09 17:12:12]Stormbringer <pd> maybe the general has taken something from a prisoner
[Sep 10-09 17:12:36]Stormbringer <pd> and this thing needs to be found in the generals room
[Sep 10-09 17:12:50]Stormbringer <pd> only way in is to kill the general and use the portal
[Sep 10-09 17:13:40]Stormbringer <pd> heh
[Sep 10-09 17:36:5]Stormbringer <pd> you should have went north east instead of south east with the caves
[Sep 10-09 17:38:41]Stormbringer <pd> no it is down
[Sep 10-09 17:38:53]Stormbringer <pd> I can guarantee it isn't up
[Sep 10-09 17:41:31]Stormbringer <pd> eh?
[Sep 10-09 17:42:11]Stormbringer <pd> you messed up
[Sep 10-09 17:42:17]Stormbringer <pd> didn't use id
[Sep 10-09 17:42:29]Stormbringer <pd> and we have 6 rats of each kind
[Sep 10-09 17:43:39]Stormbringer <pd> the load code should look for the mobs set_id
[Sep 10-09 17:44:43]Stormbringer <pd> the spiders aren't the probelm, it is the rats
[Sep 10-09 17:54:53]Stormbringer <pd> unicorn can't be looked at with monster and child can't be looked at with child
[Sep 10-09 17:56:37]Stormbringer <pd> a mount that heals itself???
[Sep 10-09 18:19:12]Stormbringer <pd> nah, I think they are fine
[Sep 10-09 18:19:28]Stormbringer <pd> it's ok, makes it worth the xp
[Sep 10-09 18:19:42]Stormbringer <pd> Geddoe might have been a lagg
[Sep 10-09 18:20:0]Stormbringer <pd> he went off and right back online at death
[Sep 10-09 18:33:52]Stormbringer <pd> nod
[Sep 10-09 18:33:54]Stormbringer <pd> lol
[Sep 10-09 18:33:58]Stormbringer <pd> that would be funny
[Sep 10-09 18:35:56]Stormbringer <pd> kk, set agressive is gone
[Sep 10-09 23:11:31]Nulvect <pd> well your fangs were the strongest knife in the game :P
[Sep 10-09 23:11:53]Nulvect <pd> yeah, that's probably blame well placed
[Sep 10-09 23:11:55]Stormbringer <pd> same as the one here
[Sep 10-09 23:12:3]Nulvect <pd> I just go by what's in play
[Sep 10-09 23:12:9]Stormbringer <pd> it was reworked a coiuple of years ago by NS
[Sep 11-09 0:36:12]Stormbringer <pd> eh?
[Sep 11-09 0:36:46]Stormbringer <pd> nah, it doesn't matter the direction really
[Sep 11-09 0:37:16]Stormbringer <pd> my thought was, if it had of gone north from the dig I could put a second entrance in the drow camp
[Sep 11-09 0:37:54]Stormbringer <pd> then I thought about having a secret entrance from the generals tent to somewhere in the castle, then we finalized on the portal
[Sep 11-09 0:38:20]Stormbringer <pd> nod
[Sep 12-09 21:39:13]Stormbringer <pd> bow isn't a type
[Sep 12-09 21:39:39]Stormbringer <pd> yeah
[Sep 12-09 21:45:1]Stormbringer <pd> sure :)
[Oct 6-09 1:13:2]Daos <pd> yeah?
[Oct 6-09 1:13:35]Daos <pd> /doc/build/etc/light
[Oct 6-09 1:13:40]Daos <pd> that is what I've always used
[Oct 6-09 1:14:20]Daos <pd> really?
[Oct 6-09 1:14:34]Daos <pd> do you have a /doc?
[Oct 6-09 1:14:48]Daos <pd> that is right, he changed the docs
[Oct 6-09 1:15:22]Daos <pd> what kind of lighting do you want?
[Oct 6-09 1:16:2]Daos <pd> so it would be outdoors for a cavern?
[Oct 6-09 1:16:18]Daos <pd> ah, ok
[Oct 6-09 1:16:40]Daos <pd> try 1 or 0
[Oct 6-09 1:17:14]Daos <pd> yeah, well if they are going to be blind in your area at least let them know :)
[Oct 6-09 1:17:36]Daos <pd> I usually stick with 2 and 3 for fair lighting
[Oct 6-09 1:18:20]Daos <pd> over the pd line? :P
[Oct 6-09 1:18:44]Daos <pd> I know but I can't go on facebook :P
[Oct 6-09 1:19:4]Daos <pd> taking a break until nov
[Oct 6-09 1:19:6]Daos <pd> spending too much time on there
[Oct 6-09 1:19:26]Daos <pd> and mafia wars doesn't help
[Oct 6-09 1:21:58]Daos <pd> how come?
[Oct 6-09 1:24:56]Daos <pd> writing descriptions is the time-consuming part of building, once you get that out of the way the rest is easy depending on the area
[Oct 6-09 1:28:0]Daos <pd> yeah, since all you have to do is write 5-10 descriptions and have the rooms generated
[Oct 6-09 1:30:38]<pd> Daos nods
[Oct 6-09 1:34:0]Daos <pd> railing
[Oct 6-09 1:34:14]Daos <pd> hell you knew the answer :P
[Oct 6-09 15:40:20]Stormbringer <pd> I really had rather you not discuss code over the OCC line
[Oct 6-09 15:40:50]Stormbringer <pd> the connected line is for you to chat with other players, keep code to this line
[Oct 6-09 15:43:34]Stormbringer <pd> the problem is your id you are using is too deep. It should be the first id used.
[Oct 6-09 15:44:14]Stormbringer <pd> so move wallarcher to the first spot
[Oct 7-09 16:34:21]Stormbringer <pd> did you fix it?
[Oct 8-09 19:32:57]Stormbringer <pd> then there is a post
[Oct 8-09 19:33:9]Stormbringer <pd> make sure to find and read it
[Oct 8-09 19:33:25]Stormbringer <pd> don't guess about what is covered, it is very important
[Oct 8-09 19:33:57]Stormbringer <pd> if you can't find it on a post there, let me know
[Oct 8-09 19:43:49]Stormbringer <pd> one or the other
[Oct 8-09 19:43:53]Stormbringer <pd> not both
[Oct 8-09 19:44:15]Stormbringer <pd> I think so
[Oct 8-09 19:44:23]Stormbringer <pd> well
[Oct 8-09 19:44:33]Stormbringer <pd> you could have it query which hand it is on
[Oct 8-09 19:44:41]Stormbringer <pd> and set it to the query
[Oct 8-09 19:44:47]Stormbringer <pd> ummm
[Oct 8-09 19:44:55]Stormbringer <pd> it should be doable
[Oct 8-09 19:45:9]Stormbringer <pd> I am not a coder though ;)
[Oct 8-09 19:45:43]Stormbringer <pd> if you know what area they are from sure
[Oct 8-09 19:45:57]Stormbringer <pd> kk
[Oct 8-09 19:47:37]Stormbringer <pd> no, not finger
[Oct 8-09 19:48:7]Stormbringer <pd> I hate the directory structue of merk
[Oct 8-09 19:49:7]Stormbringer <pd> it is in /d/freepk/merkkerri/mob/merkkirri
[Oct 8-09 19:49:35]Stormbringer <pd> well it is set wrong
[Oct 8-09 19:49:47]Stormbringer <pd> right and eft hand
[Oct 8-09 19:50:3]Stormbringer <pd> let me talk to nul about it
[Oct 8-09 19:50:59]Stormbringer <pd> nah, this is about a balance issue and setting code, not something Pyro would know
[Oct 8-09 19:52:13]Stormbringer <pd> FK
[Oct 8-09 19:52:23]Stormbringer <pd> afk even
[Oct 9-09 22:52:45]Stormbringer <pd> shirt I think
[Oct 9-09 22:53:31]Stormbringer <pd> that is wrong
[Oct 9-09 22:53:43]Stormbringer <pd> tunic protects torso
[Oct 9-09 22:54:1]Stormbringer <pd> dress can cover legs
[Oct 27-09 20:59:11]Stormbringer <pd> sup?
[Oct 27-09 20:59:43]Stormbringer <pd> gimme a sec
[Oct 27-09 21:0:17]Stormbringer <pd> rare drops are much more rare
[Oct 27-09 21:0:33]Stormbringer <pd> say 1 in 10 =P
[Oct 27-09 21:0:49]Stormbringer <pd> maybe
[Oct 27-09 21:3:23]Stormbringer <pd> max about 4k give or take
[Oct 27-09 21:9:29]Stormbringer <pd> I got some sample code on a random drop somewhere
[Oct 27-09 21:9:49]Stormbringer <pd> but I am not up for looking for it. Waht mob has the damond on it?
[Oct 27-09 21:11:19]Stormbringer <pd> o, tis simple
[Oct 27-09 21:12:49]Stormbringer <pd> add a if(random(100) < 10) before the new(bag)->move(this_obj());
[Oct 27-09 21:13:37]Stormbringer <pd> shouldn't be needed on a mob
[Oct 27-09 21:14:9]Stormbringer <pd> nod
[Oct 27-09 21:15:31]Stormbringer <pd> bd is 5k I htink
[Oct 27-09 21:16:3]Stormbringer <pd> should
[Oct 27-09 21:16:29]Stormbringer <pd> drop it to 3500 + random 500
[Oct 27-09 22:13:3]Stormbringer <pd> kk, looks fine other than all being shop
[Oct 27-09 22:13:37]Stormbringer <pd> wait
[Oct 27-09 22:13:47]Stormbringer <pd> //                             "food shop" : ROOMS "food.c"]));
[Oct 27-09 22:14:7]Stormbringer <pd> should be "enter food shop" : ROOMS "food.c"]));
[Oct 27-09 22:14:21]Stormbringer <pd> al of them should start with enter
[Oct 27-09 22:14:29]Stormbringer <pd> it is what moves it to the new line
[Oct 27-09 22:15:11]Stormbringer <pd> oi
[Oct 27-09 22:15:23]Stormbringer <pd> so all the alias' need to have enter added to them too
[Oct 27-09 22:15:37]Stormbringer <pd> //add_exit_alias("enter food shop", "shop");]));
[Oct 27-09 22:16:31]Stormbringer <pd> yeah
[Oct 27-09 22:16:51]Stormbringer <pd> though shop wont work with so many of them
[Oct 27-09 22:17:19]Stormbringer <pd> hold on
[Oct 27-09 22:19:33]Stormbringer <pd> it's wrong
[Oct 27-09 22:19:43]Stormbringer <pd> I mailed you a copy of exits in tirun
[Oct 27-09 22:20:7]Stormbringer <pd> it still has to be in set_exits
[Oct 27-09 22:20:27]Stormbringer <pd> but
[Oct 27-09 22:20:37]Stormbringer <pd> the aliases are outside the set_exits
[Oct 27-09 22:20:59]Stormbringer <pd> they come after the close of set_exits
[Oct 27-09 22:21:21]Stormbringer <pd> you have them mixed in, which won't work
[Oct 27-09 22:25:24]Stormbringer <pd> that looks good
[Oct 27-09 22:37:34]Stormbringer <pd> can be ROOMS
[Oct 27-09 22:37:44]Stormbringer <pd> just make sure to include your header
[Oct 29-09 1:48:22]Stormbringer <pd> probably
[Oct 29-09 1:48:32]Daos <pd> have you checked the filename?
[Oct 29-09 1:48:40]Daos <pd> did you include the header?
[Oct 29-09 1:48:56]Daos <pd> I'm just going through the initial checks :P
[Oct 29-09 1:48:56]Stormbringer <pd> will explain it when you return D
[Oct 29-09 1:50:38]Stormbringer <pd> just a sec
[Nov 9-09 16:41:41]Stormbringer <pd> eh?
[Nov 13-09 0:53:48]Stormbringer <pd> check in /d/nopk/standard/rain_forest/corinthor/rooms/
[Nov 13-09 0:54:2]Stormbringer <pd> the throne room is in there somewhere and has a throne like that
[Nov 17-09 21:31:49]Stormbringer <pd> heh
[Nov 17-09 21:34:11]Stormbringer <pd> oh
[Nov 17-09 21:34:21]Stormbringer <pd> the mob was using the wong command
[Nov 17-09 21:47:39]Nulvect <pd> hey
[Nov 17-09 21:48:5]Nulvect <pd> um I think so
[Nov 17-09 21:49:11]Nulvect <pd> alrighty
[Nov 17-09 21:49:35]Stormbringer <pd> guess I can do my walk through now that everyone else has done theirs and everything is good :p
[Nov 17-09 21:50:25]Stormbringer <pd> nah, that was just spot checkin =P
[Nov 18-09 18:45:41]Nulvect <pd> and this one connects to the builder's port
[Nov 19-09 12:53:25]Nulvect <pd> something is sending the number 504 instead of a string
[Nov 19-09 12:53:41]Nulvect <pd> or the other way around
[Nov 19-09 13:0:47]Nulvect <pd> woop, gotta take off
[Nov 19-09 13:1:25]Nulvect <pd> everything working ok now??
[Nov 20-09 13:0:16]Nulvect <pd> vian, we're just about ready to move zolenia over, I'll probably do a few minor tweaks to it tonight, if that's ok
[Nov 20-09 13:1:32]Nulvect <pd> may even move it over this afternoon and do a quick runthrough
[Nov 20-09 13:1:40]Nulvect <pd> off for now though
[Nov 20-09 19:46:45]Nulvect <pd> copying zolenia over to main port, so any further changes need to be communicated to someone over here
[Nov 20-09 20:4:14]Nulvect <pd> hey where's the entrance to zolenia??
[Nov 20-09 20:5:4]Nulvect <pd> oh
[Nov 20-09 20:5:6]Nulvect <pd> ok
[Nov 20-09 20:5:22]Nulvect <pd> I'm doing to change the arrows to use a different function to take armour into account
[Nov 20-09 20:5:40]Nulvect <pd> and going to tweak the exits to the trade district and academy cause they still seem weird
[Nov 20-09 20:5:48]Nulvect <pd> that's about it
[Nov 20-09 20:6:14]Nulvect <pd> yeah should be easy
[Nov 20-09 20:6:20]Nulvect <pd> I'll be back in about 3-4 hours myself
[Nov 20-09 20:6:48]Nulvect <pd> note to self: put that deed through rigorous testing
[Nov 21-09 13:5:19]Stormbringer <pd> how's it going?
[Nov 21-09 13:7:9]Stormbringer <pd> heh
[Nov 21-09 13:7:33]Stormbringer <pd> know the feeling, had insomnia last night. Didn't get to sleep till after 6 this morning.
[Nov 21-09 13:12:53]Stormbringer <pd> heh
[Nov 21-09 13:28:41]Stormbringer <pd> blah, reboot
[Nov 21-09 13:31:49]Stormbringer <pd> nod
[Nov 21-09 13:36:47]Stormbringer <pd> actually it is more like 2.3x
[Nov 21-09 13:37:5]Stormbringer <pd> 30 hours versus ever 12... err so 2.5
[Nov 21-09 13:38:5]Stormbringer <pd> think so?
[Nov 21-09 13:38:7]Stormbringer <pd> hrm
[Nov 21-09 13:38:15]Stormbringer <pd> heh
[Nov 21-09 13:38:59]Stormbringer <pd> huh?
[Nov 21-09 13:47:19]Nulvect <pd> hey vian, where's the hole exit supposed to lead?? back to the room in roston where you dig??
[Nov 21-09 13:54:41]Nulvect <pd> climb1
[Nov 21-09 13:54:53]Nulvect <pd> ok
[Nov 21-09 14:7:33]Nulvect <pd> vian, you uh... put quotes around all your set_alignment numbers
[Nov 21-09 14:18:35]Nulvect <pd> dunno why it works over there
[Nov 21-09 14:19:27]Nulvect <pd> blah can't get a sed script to work right to fix it quickly
[Nov 21-09 14:21:11]Nulvect <pd> nevermind, got it
[Nov 21-09 14:21:25]Nulvect <pd> apparently .+ does not count a - as part of a word
[Nov 21-09 14:21:29]Nulvect <pd> .* worked though
[Nov 21-09 14:22:55]Nulvect <pd> for f in `ls -1 *.c`; do sed -e 's/set_alignment("\(.*\)")/set_alignment(\1)/' $f > $f.new; done
[Nov 21-09 14:22:59]Nulvect <pd> fear my sed-fu
[Nov 21-09 14:27:8]Nulvect <pd> why are the exits set in reset() in some of these files
[Nov 21-09 14:28:46]Nulvect <pd> it does but it's weird
[Nov 21-09 14:29:12]Nulvect <pd> haha
[Nov 21-09 14:29:18]Nulvect <pd> putting them back in create() now :P
[Nov 21-09 14:29:38]Nulvect <pd> the I command in ed is awesome, by the way
[Nov 21-09 14:30:0]Nulvect <pd> indents the code
[Nov 21-09 14:30:30]Nulvect <pd> between . and x you should hit I
[Nov 21-09 14:44:8]Nulvect <pd> ok, fixed all the entrances
[Nov 21-09 14:44:14]Nulvect <pd> just need to test that deed
[Nov 21-09 14:48:58]Nulvect <pd> so you can't go back while on the dragon??
[Nov 21-09 14:48:58]Nulvect <pd> hmmm
[Nov 21-09 15:3:22]Nulvect <pd> yeah this is really causing problems...
[Nov 21-09 15:3:30]Nulvect <pd> why not just let the player ride in the regular rooms??
[Nov 21-09 15:4:0]Stormbringer <pd> cause I don't want a dragon mount loose on the mud ;)
[Nov 21-09 15:4:24]Nulvect <pd> we could just set a function so you can only ride him if he's in zolenia
[Nov 21-09 15:4:52]Nulvect <pd> plus it doesn't make sense that you can't go back the way you came
[Nov 21-09 15:5:22]Nulvect <pd> people will try to kill the mobs, run into the next room, then be pissed they can't get back to finish it off
[Nov 21-09 15:12:8]Nulvect <pd> I need to take off for a little bit, still some tweaks to do to that deed
[Nov 21-09 15:13:58]Nulvect <pd> zolenia's closed off for the moment
[Nov 21-09 17:47:21]Stormbringer <pd> :)
[Nov 21-09 23:43:26]Nulvect <pd> blah
[Nov 21-09 23:44:12]Nulvect <pd> yeah
[Nov 21-09 23:44:38]Nulvect <pd> I really think we should just take the cloned rooms part out of the deed
[Nov 21-09 23:44:58]Nulvect <pd> also need to allow him to be led by races that can't ride
[Nov 21-09 23:45:40]Nulvect <pd> actually the code to have him go through the portal can just be in him too
[Nov 21-09 23:45:58]Nulvect <pd> I just had something trigger him as soon as I walked into the room
[Nov 21-09 23:46:4]Nulvect <pd> dunno what it was
[Nov 21-09 23:46:42]Nulvect <pd> oh, yeah, that stuff too... it doesn't check what you're riding
[Nov 21-09 23:46:54]Nulvect <pd> so kataans could summon a nightmare and ride it
[Nov 21-09 23:46:54]Nulvect <pd> hehe
[Nov 21-09 23:47:54]Nulvect <pd> I really think that, rather than try to shoehorn the players with all these kludges, it would be better to just make sure the dragon can't leave zolenia and can't be ridden outside zolenia
[Nov 21-09 23:48:40]Nulvect <pd> it's rather inventive, really
[Nov 21-09 23:49:6]Nulvect <pd> it just has holes in it
[Nov 21-09 23:51:26]Nulvect <pd> I think these init things that damage you when you fall going down the hole need to be post_exit functions
[Nov 21-09 23:51:56]Nulvect <pd> ah..hmm
[Nov 21-09 23:52:54]Nulvect <pd> ok
[Nov 22-09 0:20:48]Nulvect <pd> sounds odd
[Nov 22-09 0:21:24]Stormbringer <pd> there are a couple of people who mud from their blackberry
[Nov 22-09 0:21:52]Stormbringer <pd> don't know they actually play, just hang and talk I thihk
[Nov 22-09 0:22:28]Stormbringer <pd> would love to do an iphone mudding app =P
[Nov 22-09 0:22:46]Nulvect <pd> mmm I love realism
[Nov 22-09 0:22:56]Nulvect <pd> no more arrows in the shoulder if the archers are dead
[Nov 22-09 0:24:14]Nulvect <pd> it's alright
[Nov 22-09 0:24:20]Nulvect <pd> I'm a nitpicker
[Nov 22-09 0:24:28]Stormbringer <pd> it's my fault, I am the one who suggested half the things you did =P
[Nov 22-09 0:24:44]Stormbringer <pd> even cloning the rooms =P
[Nov 22-09 0:24:52]Nulvect <pd> why are these archers wielding two bows??
[Nov 22-09 0:25:8]Nulvect <pd> hehe
[Nov 22-09 0:25:20]Nulvect <pd> yeah if it's ok with you stormy I'll just bypass the cloned rooms thing
[Nov 22-09 0:25:26]Stormbringer <pd> maybe the dragon should just run through the area all the way out
[Nov 22-09 0:25:32]Stormbringer <pd> the rider has no control
[Nov 22-09 0:25:54]Stormbringer <pd> whatever is good Nul :)
[Nov 22-09 0:26:4]Nulvect <pd> that's not much of a deed if the player doesn't have to do anything
[Nov 22-09 0:26:28]Stormbringer <pd> I was on late helping Vian do his deed, tis what happenes when I am tired sometimes;)
[Nov 22-09 0:27:0]Stormbringer <pd> yeah, well it will at least scare the crap out of them, runaway dragon would startle me =P
[Nov 22-09 0:27:8]Stormbringer <pd> lol!
[Nov 22-09 0:27:14]Stormbringer <pd> made you do it =P
[Nov 22-09 0:27:52]Stormbringer <pd> guess it is a good thing I didn't tell you the other idea I had =P
[Nov 22-09 0:42:0]Stormbringer <pd> hey Vian
[Nov 22-09 0:43:26]Stormbringer <pd> kk, see you then
[Nov 22-09 0:46:40]Stormbringer <pd> your home?
[Nov 22-09 0:46:56]Stormbringer <pd> login over here
[Feb 2-10 12:50:54]Nulvect <pd> hmm
[Mar 26-10 4:14:20]Daos <pd> test
[Mar 26-10 4:14:36]Daos <pd> there we go... now it's working
[Mar 26-10 4:14:40]Vian <pd> i think its just
[Mar 26-10 4:14:44]Vian <pd> you are silly
[Mar 26-10 4:14:48]Daos <pd> had to start up the network
[Mar 26-10 4:25:14]Stormbringer <pd> you guys are gonna run Orcha off then I will have to run you guys off ;)
[Mar 26-10 4:25:54]Vian <pd> haha okay i'll keep my arguing with daos on this port :P
[Mar 26-10 4:42:50]Stormbringer <pd> night guys
[Mar 26-10 19:37:16]Vian <pd> use this line btw
[Mar 27-10 1:49:6]Daos <pd> I can give you a hand in just a few Orcha, on the phone with my brother about my phone
[Mar 27-10 2:5:50]A shadow <pd> if you just need something quick I can help you
[Mar 27-10 2:7:50]A shadow <pd> guess I came into that a little late
[Mar 27-10 2:7:54]A shadow <pd> night
[Mar 28-10 1:37:29]Daos <pd> saw it the first time man :P
[Mar 28-10 1:37:53]Daos <pd> will any of the monsters die on builder's?
[Mar 28-10 1:42:7]Daos <pd> yeah I am here, can you wait until I finish up my bank stuff?
[Mar 28-10 1:46:3]Daos <pd> oh really? that is very cool
[Mar 28-10 1:46:11]Daos <pd> how old is she?
[Mar 28-10 4:25:52]Vian <pd> procha
[Mar 28-10 4:25:56]Vian <pd> volik
[Mar 28-10 4:25:58]Vian <pd> voxli
[Mar 28-10 19:44:14]Stormbringer <pd> blah
[Mar 28-10 19:48:54]Vian <pd> breakin thingses!?
[Mar 28-10 19:49:6]Stormbringer <pd> nah
[Mar 28-10 19:49:14]Stormbringer <pd> checking it out
[Apr 29-10 19:31:41]Nulvect <pd> if any errors pop up over there, let me know
[Apr 29-10 19:32:37]Nulvect <pd> ok, I'll fix that
[Apr 29-10 19:32:47]Stormbringer <pd> bah, details =P
[Apr 29-10 19:33:47]Nulvect <pd> oh crap, I didn't restore the old network info for builders
[Apr 29-10 19:33:53]Nulvect <pd> surprised this line is even working
[Apr 29-10 19:44:25]Nulvect <pd> ok, anonymous ftp access has been added
[Apr 29-10 19:44:53]Nulvect <pd> ftp to mud.primaldarkness.com port 21, anonymous login, and it will put everything into /ftp on builders
[Apr 29-10 19:45:11]Nulvect <pd> so you may want to just make your own dir in there
[Apr 29-10 19:46:9]Nulvect <pd> be sure to use ascii or text mode for uploading or you'll end up with ^M chars at the end of every line
[Apr 29-10 19:46:17]Nulvect <pd> it works as passive
[Apr 29-10 19:46:57]Nulvect <pd> good good
[Apr 29-10 19:48:9]Nulvect <pd> never used that
[Apr 29-10 19:48:37]Nulvect <pd> I use ncftp
[Apr 29-10 20:19:41]Nulvect <pd> no, most of our commands are rather... primitive
[Apr 29-10 20:21:53]Nulvect <pd> I could do that right now
[Apr 29-10 20:24:35]Nulvect <pd> /include/domains/
[Apr 29-10 20:26:49]Nulvect <pd> ok
[Apr 29-10 21:18:51]Nulvect <pd> ok, done
[Apr 29-10 21:23:57]Nulvect <pd> nope
[Apr 29-10 21:24:19]Nulvect <pd> you should be able to mv a whole dir somewhere else
[Apr 30-10 10:37:36]Vian <pd> be there in a sec
[May 4-10 16:41:23]Stormbringer <pd> no worries
[May 4-10 16:42:41]Stormbringer <pd> no one here is required to do anything, though after a long time those who are idle and do nothing could be arrested
[May 12-10 2:41:39]Daos <pd> sure
[May 12-10 4:38:40]Drackmire <pd> ?
[May 12-10 4:41:4]Drackmire <pd> :)
[May 12-10 4:42:50]Drackmire <pd> you can use command("look")
[May 12-10 4:44:18]Drackmire <pd> you have a couple options...
[May 12-10 4:44:34]Drackmire <pd> Do you want the monster to actually look, or to just print a message?
[May 12-10 4:45:4]Drackmire <pd> If you want it to actually execute the look command on a timed basis, call_outs would probably work
[May 12-10 4:45:18]Drackmire <pd> so like
[May 12-10 4:45:24]Drackmire <pd> you would set up some function
[May 12-10 4:46:24]Drackmire <pd> int look_func(){ command("look"); call_out("look_func", TIME); return 1; }
[May 12-10 4:46:54]Drackmire <pd> and then you would use call_out("look_func", TIME) somewhere in the monster's creation
[May 12-10 4:47:10]Drackmire <pd> you can just check to see if the object is in the room directly
[May 12-10 4:47:42]Drackmire <pd> let me think...
[May 12-10 4:48:34]Drackmire <pd> so like, you could do it in the monster's heart_beat
[May 12-10 4:49:20]Drackmire <pd> so like, adding in the monster's code void heart_beart() { ::heart_beat(); function(); }
[May 12-10 4:49:32]Drackmire <pd> and then define a function to check the room
[May 12-10 4:49:54]Drackmire <pd> which involves some combination of the environment and present efuns that I need to think for a second to process
[May 12-10 4:50:22]Drackmire <pd> so like you can do
[May 12-10 4:51:20]Drackmire <pd> int function() { if(present("object_name", environment(this_object()))) { command("get object_name"); return 1; }
[May 12-10 4:51:30]Drackmire <pd> yeah
[May 12-10 4:52:40]Drackmire <pd> set_emotes(<int> delay, ({ "something to say" }) );
[May 12-10 4:57:36]Drackmire <pd> did that all make sense, or do you have any other questions?  bout to go to bed
[May 12-10 4:59:10]Drackmire <pd> you might have to write the name of the monster in
[May 12-10 4:59:44]Drackmire <pd> word peace out
[May 12-10 15:42:29]Daos <pd> you want to set the type of armour
[May 12-10 15:42:45]Daos <pd> and you can specify the limbs with set_limbs()
[May 12-10 15:42:49]Nulvect <pd> set_limbs( ({ "torso", "left arm", "right arm", "left leg", "right leg" }) );
[May 12-10 15:43:21]Nulvect <pd> keep in mind that anyone without those limbs will not be able to wear it, including raknids, centaurs, weimics
[May 12-10 15:46:11]Daos <pd> int query_auto_load() { return 1; }
[May 12-10 15:48:45]Nulvect <pd> wrong
[May 12-10 15:49:15]Nulvect <pd> most armour should not a/l always
[May 12-10 15:50:27]Daos <pd> well, yeah there should be conditions for a/l
[May 12-10 15:50:37]Daos <pd> but I thought he just was asking for the code
[May 12-10 15:57:35]Nulvect <pd> you make a separate function, after the end of your create function:
[May 12-10 15:59:9]Nulvect <pd> int query_auto_load() { if (this_player()->query_level() >= 20) return 1; else return 0; }
[May 12-10 15:59:31]Nulvect <pd> but I think I may implement that set_auto_load thing
[May 12-10 16:0:7]Vian <pd> set_auto_load would be nice
[May 12-10 16:21:5]Nulvect <pd> look around :P
[May 12-10 21:51:33]Vian <pd> I am for 2 minutes!
[May 12-10 21:51:39]Vian <pd> If its something small :)
[May 12-10 21:51:43]Vian <pd> Bout to run out tho
[May 13-10 1:11:7]Drackmire <pd> yeah sure, what up?
[May 13-10 1:12:49]Drackmire <pd> what do you mean by put up?
[May 13-10 1:13:45]Drackmire <pd> oh ok
[May 13-10 1:13:47]Drackmire <pd> heh
[May 13-10 1:13:57]Drackmire <pd> I don't have a character on builders
[May 13-10 1:14:25]Drackmire <pd> yim?
[May 13-10 1:14:55]Drackmire <pd> oh, no.  anymore I just gchat, use these lines or do homework :P
[May 13-10 1:16:45]Drackmire <pd> word, just let me know if you need anything, I'll be studying
[May 13-10 1:41:11]Vian <pd> hmm?  getting on builders
[May 13-10 17:35:55]Stormbringer <pd> eh??
[May 13-10 17:35:57]Stormbringer <pd> eh??
[May 13-10 17:45:43]Stormbringer <pd> you ok?
[May 13-10 20:43:57]Stormbringer <pd> eh?
[May 14-10 0:36:58]Nulvect <pd> plop
[May 14-10 0:38:24]Drackmire <pd> I've always been a big fan of the PONG! response
[May 14-10 0:59:56]Nulvect <pd> ok
[May 14-10 0:59:58]Nulvect <pd> which things??
[May 14-10 1:15:54]Nulvect <pd> that's complicated actually
[May 14-10 1:16:6]Drackmire <pd> can't you make it hunt?
[May 19-10 0:53:43]Nulvect <pd> um... do you need help coding something specific, or are you just trying to recruit people to do descriptions for you??
[May 19-10 0:55:7]Nulvect <pd> ah
[May 19-10 0:57:19]Nulvect <pd> yeah it's just some work
[May 19-10 0:57:29]Nulvect <pd> I'm debugging a new ls command
[May 19-10 0:58:7]Nulvect <pd> what do you mean??
[May 19-10 0:58:25]Nulvect <pd> the order of the exits doesn't matter, no
[May 19-10 1:1:7]Nulvect <pd> yes
[May 19-10 1:49:23]Daos <pd> to add a mob to a room?
[May 19-10 1:49:33]Daos <pd> new("/path of mob")->move(this_object());
[May 19-10 1:54:25]Daos <pd> void reset() {
[May 19-10 1:54:27]Daos <pd> ::reset();
[May 19-10 1:54:37]Daos <pd> if (!present("mob")) {
[May 19-10 1:54:45]Daos <pd> new("/path of mob")->move(this_object());
[May 19-10 1:54:47]Daos <pd> }
[May 19-10 2:1:15]Nulvect <pd> the short desc only shows when you are in brief mode
[May 19-10 4:25:13]Nulvect <pd> blah
[May 19-10 4:25:43]Nulvect <pd> well, fixed the name...
[May 19-10 16:13:57]Daos <pd> how's it going micky?
[May 19-10 16:43:31]Daos <pd> didn't you see my code from last night?
[May 19-10 16:44:41]Daos <pd> void reset() {
[May 19-10 16:44:43]Daos <pd> ::reset();
[May 19-10 16:44:51]Daos <pd> if (!present("mob")) {
[May 19-10 16:44:59]Daos <pd> new("mob")->move(this_object());
[May 19-10 16:45:1]Daos <pd> }
[May 19-10 16:45:17]Daos <pd> mis
[May 19-10 16:45:25]Daos <pd> that should be what you want
[May 19-10 19:45:56]Vian <pd> I am sup
[May 19-10 19:50:18]Vian <pd> hehe getting on there
[May 19-10 21:18:22]Daos <pd> what commands?
[May 19-10 21:19:32]Daos <pd> not sure I follow
[May 19-10 21:19:34]Daos <pd> what are you trying to do?
[May 19-10 21:19:50]Daos <pd> hmm...
[May 19-10 21:21:30]Daos <pd> you could use catch_tell()
[May 21-10 21:24:33]Nulvect <pd> hi
[May 22-10 15:45:29]Nulvect <pd> cool cool, let me know if you need anything
[May 30-10 0:18:27]Daos <pd> ok, also check cre on main when you get a sec
[May 31-10 18:31:33]Nulvect <pd> how's it going man
[May 31-10 18:33:1]Nulvect <pd> nod
[Jul 25-10 15:41:2]Stormbringer <pd> vlah
