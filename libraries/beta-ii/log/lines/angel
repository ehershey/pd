[Nov 23-06 2:37:20]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<angel>%^RESET%^ The alignment part?
[Nov 23-06 2:37:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<angel>%^RESET%^ because I wanted any sub to be able to use it decently, and you can't count on them having any magic or faith skills
[Nov 23-06 2:38:20]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<angel>%^RESET%^ Ahh. So, it'd be the same if I didn't have faith moves? Also! Love the message it gives you when you try to attack a s3 angel with it.

[Mar 9-07 12:55:14]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<angel>%^RESET%^ 12 hours of silence generally breaks a conversation up :P
[Mar 9-07 12:55:20]Goldenberry %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<angel>%^RESET%^ that you can rub oils/stones/ointments while the spell is going off
[Mar 9-07 12:55:36]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<angel>%^RESET%^ k, it's probably an issue with the items
[Mar 9-07 12:55:42]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<angel>%^RESET%^ will look into it
[Mar 9-07 12:55:46]Goldenberry %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<angel>%^RESET%^ it was the last thing i discussed with you, and as they were related, thought i'd bring it up
[Mar 9-07 12:55:54]Cowl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<angel>%^RESET%^ was gonna say, i hope levin aint changin :P its the racial abil to shoot for now :P

[Mar 10-07 2:10:55]Kazuma %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^<angel>%^RESET%^ I was going to try it out, but I seen that you were doing it, so I was like, Ehhh, cleric.
[Mar 10-07 2:11:9]Goldenberry %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^<angel>%^RESET%^ lol you could have done it too lol
[Mar 10-07 2:11:11]Kazuma %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^<angel>%^RESET%^ I like doing my own thing. Just like when there's another angel cleric I will probably switch to something else.
[Mar 10-07 2:11:25]Kazuma %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^<angel>%^RESET%^ But I love angels. They are so underrated it's not funny.
[Mar 10-07 2:11:37]Goldenberry %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^<angel>%^RESET%^ hated monk

[Mar 10-07 2:13:24]Kazuma %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^<angel>%^RESET%^ Bard was fun, jester...not so much, cleric's alright. (those are the only ones I give pluses two out of: sorceror, ranger, berserker, jester, bard, cleric, monk, scout, druid, and assassin)
[Mar 10-07 2:13:43]Goldenberry %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^<angel>%^RESET%^ nods-
[Mar 10-07 2:13:49]Kazuma %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^<angel>%^RESET%^ I think I might try gypsy next.

[Apr 23-07 15:50:10]Ancient <angel> lol
[Apr 23-07 15:50:20]Ancient <angel> only way to get back to the hall is with the halo right?
[Apr 23-07 15:50:26]Warrick <angel> or walk
[Apr 23-07 15:50:30]Ancient <angel> ahh
[Apr 23-07 15:50:32]Warrick <angel> go to lodos
[Apr 23-07 15:50:36]Ancient <angel> nod
[Apr 23-07 15:50:36]Warrick <angel> and go to tower
[Apr 23-07 15:50:38]Warrick <angel> and type ascend
[Apr 23-07 15:50:48]Ancient <angel> nod, thanks man
[Apr 23-07 15:50:52]Warrick <angel> np man
[Apr 23-07 15:51:6]Warrick <angel> remorted outta my usual thug self to try out bard
[Apr 23-07 15:51:16]Ancient <angel> hows the bard life?
[Apr 23-07 15:51:36]Warrick <angel> apparently their horrible
[Apr 23-07 15:51:44]Ancient <angel> lol
[Apr 23-07 15:52:0]Warrick <angel> their songs are supposed to be "charisma" based but i see no trace of that
[Apr 23-07 15:52:12]Warrick <angel> it seems like this class is #!##!# because of the cost of their skills
[Apr 23-07 15:52:20]Warrick <angel> and not only that
[Apr 23-07 15:52:24]Warrick <angel> their -skills- based
[Apr 23-07 15:52:34]Ancient <angel> yeah most wanderers have high skill costs i thought
[Apr 23-07 15:52:38]Warrick <angel> the only thing that seems to take in some stats
[Apr 23-07 15:52:44]Warrick <angel> is the the ability strike
[Apr 23-07 15:52:48]Warrick <angel> which is new
[Apr 23-07 15:52:50]Warrick <angel> or somewhat
[Apr 23-07 15:53:8]Warrick <angel> and all the generic weapon abilities everyone gets
[Apr 23-07 15:53:20]Ancient <angel> nod
[Apr 23-07 15:53:22]Warrick <angel> and those suck hardcore cuz my thug has a few of them and with his decent stats he doesnt do much :p
[Apr 23-07 15:53:42]Warrick <angel> hopefully some -year- nul hops on and fixes this
[Apr 23-07 15:53:48]Ancient <angel> well im sure bards will get fixed
[Apr 23-07 15:53:56]Warrick <angel> i feel like playing a wizard now
[Apr 23-07 15:54:4]Ancient <angel> wizards are fun :P
[Apr 23-07 15:54:12]Ancient <angel> although their spells get redundent
[Apr 23-07 15:54:18]Warrick <angel> ahh
[Apr 23-07 15:54:20]Ancient <angel> redundant
[Apr 23-07 15:54:26]Ancient <angel> still fun
[Apr 23-07 15:54:44]Warrick <angel> manabolt or manablast any fun?
[Apr 23-07 15:54:51]Ancient <angel> nod
[Apr 23-07 15:54:55]Warrick <angel> interesting
[Apr 23-07 15:54:57]Ancient <angel> they are basically the same
[Apr 23-07 15:54:59]Warrick <angel> hah
[Apr 23-07 15:55:1]Ancient <angel> just more powerful
[Apr 23-07 15:55:1]Warrick <angel> ah**
[Apr 23-07 15:55:11]Ancient <angel> manamissile,manabolt,manablast
[Apr 23-07 15:55:13]Warrick <angel> aye
[Apr 24-07 11:9:9]Ancient <angel> Im guessing levin is the only unique racial ability we have now?
[Apr 24-07 11:9:51]Nulvect <angel> at the moment
[Apr 24-07 11:10:51]Ancient <angel> :nods.
[Apr 24-07 14:22:26]Ancient <angel> anyone know what levin is based off of for sure?
[Apr 24-07 14:22:58]Ancient <angel> besides alignment
[Apr 27-07 20:46:32]Warrick <angel> yar

[Oct 5-07 14:43:17]Warrick <angel> you suck
[Oct 5-07 14:43:31]Warrick <angel> oh forgot theres other angels on teh line, you suck nox
[Oct 5-07 14:43:47]Nox <angel> thank you
[Oct 5-07 14:43:51]Warrick <angel> np
[Oct 5-07 14:43:55]Nox <angel> and no other angel you douchebag
[Oct 6-07 20:13:2]Sik <angel> hey nul, any idea if or when angels will get holyfire back?
[Oct 6-07 20:14:16]Nulvect <angel> don't know when, but I fully plan on bringing back some form of the second level racial abilities
[Oct 6-07 20:14:32]Sik <angel> cool, i'm guessing they were just too far unbalanced?
[Oct 6-07 20:16:6]Nulvect <angel> yes, plus not very good
[Oct 6-07 20:16:28]Sik <angel> nod, can i put in a ruquest for an area for angels ;)
[Oct 6-07 20:16:38]Nox <angel> might want to take a look at dragonfury :\ seems a bit strong
[Oct 6-07 20:17:45]Nulvect <angel> of course it's strong, it's supposed to be
[Oct 6-07 20:18:9]Nox <angel> guess 2k damage is normal nvm then
[Oct 6-07 20:18:15]Sik <angel> the help file does make one think that it might be able to kick some ass...
[Oct 6-07 20:18:27]Nulvect <angel> depends on who's using it on who
[Oct 6-07 20:18:53]Nox <angel> was smite and i always thought smite was weak
[Oct 6-07 20:19:1]Sik <angel> yea, not quite...
[Oct 6-07 20:19:27]Nox <angel> level 50 and 100 in mains yeah buff ;)
[Oct 6-07 20:20:3]Sik <angel> what would you consider that? weak?
[Oct 6-07 20:20:11]Nox <angel> yeah
[Oct 6-07 20:20:21]Nox <angel> 150 is average 250 is getting buf
[Oct 6-07 20:20:31]<angel> Sik chuckles.
[Oct 6-07 20:20:39]Nox <angel> the level 50 is nice though
[Oct 6-07 20:20:59]Sik <angel> could be that dragonfury is more skill based then stat based, then he would be buff
[Oct 6-07 20:21:35]<angel> Nox nods.
[Oct 6-07 20:21:59]Sik <angel> like necros, they are really skill based
[Oct 6-07 20:22:9]Nox <angel> yeah guess all magic type classes are
[Oct 6-07 20:22:39]Nulvect <angel> dragonfury looks like it needs a little tweaking but is overall fine, and can wait for now
[Oct 6-07 20:23:7]Nox <angel> well i wasn't saying it needed to be done right this second :P
[Oct 6-07 20:23:29]Sik <angel> if you are bored nul you could make levin an area spell :D
[Oct 6-07 20:23:31]Nox <angel> not like any dragons are really active
[Oct 6-07 20:23:55]Nox <angel> i always thought levin was an area until recently
[Oct 6-07 20:24:13]Sik <angel> it's pretty buff for a single, and it is my saving grace :D
[Oct 6-07 20:24:31]Nulvect <angel> yeah, it needs to come down a little bit actually
[Oct 6-07 20:24:31]Nox <angel> yeah i think levin is slightly better than gore and both are great abils
[Oct 6-07 20:24:51]Sik <angel> awww nul, leave it up higher for clerics? :P
[Oct 6-07 20:25:3]Nulvect <angel> pfft, clerics aren't meant to hurt things
[Oct 6-07 20:25:11]Sik <angel> it's my only attack spell that doesn't lower align :P
[Oct 6-07 20:25:39]Nulvect <angel> well, that's not true
[Oct 6-07 20:25:51]Nox <angel> should make fly a little different too
[Oct 6-07 20:26:17]Nulvect <angel> how so??
[Oct 6-07 20:26:19]Sik <angel> pain, unknit and wound all lower align, turn is only undead, not many of those, and dispell is just weak
[Oct 6-07 20:26:23]Nox <angel> im not sure how i just don't like it how after it reaches 75 you can speed fly no point in training it after that
[Oct 6-07 20:26:43]Sik <angel> that is a good point
[Oct 6-07 20:27:11]Sik <angel> everyone i know just trains to 75 then forgets it
[Oct 6-07 20:27:11]Nox <angel> i mean i really don't know how you would make it any different im just throwing the idea out there :P
[Oct 6-07 20:27:17]Nulvect <angel> sik, unfortunately, you are wrong on two of those counts, though on one the problem is the mobs, not the spell
[Oct 6-07 20:27:45]Nulvect <angel> hmm, I could make it so you get tired after X rooms if your flying skill is low
[Oct 6-07 20:27:49]Nox <angel> would be tight if once you change raise you can make turn effect against it or something
[Oct 6-07 20:27:53]Nulvect <angel> it does currently serve a purpose though
[Oct 6-07 20:28:9]Sik <angel> maybe if you get high enough flying skill you can set fly points
[Oct 6-07 20:28:15]Nulvect <angel> nope
[Oct 6-07 20:28:17]Sik <angel> then just type fly tene or something
[Oct 6-07 20:28:19]Nox <angel> haha nice try :\
[Oct 6-07 20:28:31]Nox <angel> thats called speedwalks sik!
[Oct 6-07 20:28:37]Sik <angel> not even at 500 flying? :P
[Oct 6-07 20:28:49]Sik <angel> sure, speed walk to merk :P
[Oct 6-07 20:29:7]Nox <angel> yeah would be tight the higher you get flying the less sp it takes up (not sure if it already does that)
[Oct 6-07 20:29:17]Nulvect <angel> I _might_ consider a single spot with a very high flying skill
[Oct 6-07 20:29:39]Nox <angel> ahh man can't be like every 100 flying you get a spot :\
[Oct 6-07 20:29:45]Nulvect <angel> nope
[Oct 6-07 20:29:53]Sik <angel> you have gate anyway :P
[Oct 6-07 20:30:1]Nox <angel> level 38...
[Oct 6-07 20:30:3]Nulvect <angel> yeah, I was about to mention that :P
[Oct 6-07 20:30:21]Nox <angel> im sorry but gate isn't worth that xp cuts
[Oct 6-07 20:30:33]Nulvect <angel> if you say so
[Oct 6-07 20:30:41]Sik <angel> get gate, xp rhon and inferi, and ff, and use psistorm...
[Oct 6-07 20:30:53]Nox <angel> i mean i plan on it when i get stronger
[Oct 6-07 20:31:3]Sik <angel> just get enough hp
[Oct 6-07 20:31:9]Sik <angel> the skills will handle the rest
[Oct 6-07 20:31:37]Nox <angel> plus people keep telling me that psistorm sucks
[Oct 6-07 20:31:41]Nulvect <angel> noted the stuff about flying
[Oct 6-07 20:31:43]Sik <angel> it's not really that bad
[Oct 6-07 20:32:13]Sik <angel> damien has it, l40 sorc with 60's and 70's and rocks out on inferi
[Oct 6-07 20:32:33]Nox <angel> ahh no 30k xp cuts at 40??
[Oct 6-07 20:32:37]Sik <angel> nope
[Oct 6-07 20:32:53]Nox <angel> i'll keep that in mind then
[Oct 6-07 20:33:9]Sik <angel> and you get psistorm at 30
[Oct 6-07 20:33:19]Nox <angel> right now working on the con so i don't get owned
[Oct 6-07 20:33:29]Sik <angel> 50 con would do it
[Oct 6-07 20:33:39]Nox <angel> i mean by these demons :\
[Oct 6-07 20:33:55]Sik <angel> umm yea, good luck with that
[Oct 6-07 20:34:3]Sik <angel> gonna need an asston of con
[Oct 6-07 20:34:9]Nox <angel> lol yeah
[Oct 6-07 20:34:23]Nox <angel> was thinking 100-150 would make me feel a lil safer ;)
[Oct 6-07 20:34:25]Sik <angel> like 200ish
[Oct 6-07 20:34:45]Sik <angel> yakko, piehl, rohl, endbringer, they all do wicked crazy damage
[Oct 6-07 20:35:1]Nox <angel> only really worried abotu yakko
[Oct 6-07 20:35:15]Nulvect <angel> haha...
[Oct 6-07 20:35:15]Nox <angel> in piehls guild and endbringer rohl don't log on much
[Oct 6-07 20:35:59]Nox <angel> whats so funny nul?
[Oct 6-07 20:36:25]Nox <angel> you think i need over 200 con? :(
[Oct 6-07 20:36:31]Nulvect <angel> my defense against yakko et al was always scry
[Oct 6-07 20:36:49]Nulvect <angel> since my con was way expensive
[Oct 6-07 20:36:55]Nox <angel> ahh yeah i mean i plan on doing that and it would really help if scry pools weren't so gay
[Oct 6-07 20:37:9]Sik <angel> you should have scry already
[Oct 6-07 20:37:17]Nox <angel> i do but yakko has 150 wisdom
[Oct 6-07 20:37:29]Sik <angel> well that could be an issue... HAHA
[Oct 6-07 20:37:59]Sik <angel> my defense against all those guys is, if they let me get big, i'll boost em :D
[Oct 6-07 20:38:5]Nox <angel> but i mean yakko can just scry pool me and then attack which sucks
[Oct 6-07 20:38:21]Sik <angel> pretty sure carina took out scry pools
[Oct 6-07 20:38:25]Nox <angel> yeah cleric and druid can do that
[Oct 6-07 20:38:29]Nox <angel> nah she didn't
[Oct 6-07 20:38:37]Sik <angel> really?
[Oct 6-07 20:38:39]Sik <angel> she should have
[Oct 6-07 20:38:43]Nox <angel> i know ls and ds still have one...
[Oct 6-07 20:38:47]Sik <angel> if she wanted to balance the guilds...
[Oct 6-07 20:39:3]Nox <angel> i lost faith that she was actually gonna balance
[Oct 6-07 20:39:37]Nox <angel> but i guess we'll see
[Oct 6-07 20:40:5]Sik <angel> i'll reserve judgement until she is done, but not removing the scry pools takes her down a couple notches
[Oct 6-07 20:40:39]Nox <angel> i don't really think scry pools should be removed just find a better way to balance them if she doesn't plan on changing them then i think they should be removed
[Oct 6-07 20:41:25]Nox <angel> and i guess she put in guild dues for a couple of days and then removed them
[Oct 6-07 20:41:31]Sik <angel> the way i understood it, she was going to remove ALL guild items, check them for balance and then reinsert them as they balanced out
[Oct 6-07 20:42:29]Nox <angel> maybe she is i know the compasses don't work anymore and a few things were changed over here
[Oct 6-07 20:43:19]Nox <angel> but yeah scry pool works... lodos :)
[Oct 6-07 20:47:42]Nox <angel> you know what would be tight a spell that cloaks someone else for a certain amount of time :p
[Oct 6-07 20:47:56]Sik <angel> would be interesting
[Oct 6-07 20:48:22]Sik <angel> or if a scout gets really good, they can make a temporary cloak that someone could wear
[Oct 6-07 20:48:40]Nox <angel> yeah would give scouts something cool which they really need
[Oct 6-07 20:48:46]Sik <angel> heck eya
[Oct 6-07 20:48:58]Nulvect <angel> it is very difficult to tell what each guild has and does not have
[Oct 6-07 20:49:4]Nox <angel> i'd play scout but the hastle of jumping back and forth
[Oct 6-07 20:49:8]Sik <angel> flyingstab is pretty cool, but not enough to play scout
[Oct 6-07 20:49:10]Nulvect <angel> that is part of why I refuse to mess with them
[Oct 6-07 20:49:18]Sik <angel> the guilds?
[Oct 6-07 20:49:20]Nox <angel> i could tell you what all the guilds have :\
[Oct 6-07 20:49:22]Nulvect <angel> yes
[Oct 6-07 20:49:30]Nox <angel> forsaken still has guild portals *coughs*
[Oct 6-07 20:49:38]Sik <angel> that's why i reccomend that she take out all guilds and start from [] 1
[Oct 6-07 20:49:52]Nox <angel> thats what she told me she was going to do but i guess not
[Oct 6-07 20:50:20]Nulvect <angel> she is collaborating with stormy and luna and figuring out how best to approach it, I believe
[Oct 6-07 20:50:22]Nox <angel> guess she only told me what i wanted to hear so i would tell stormbringer she would make a good imm :\
[Oct 6-07 20:50:30]Nox <angel> ah
[Oct 6-07 20:50:36]Nulvect <angel> everyone got all upset about something as small as the guild oils/stones
[Oct 6-07 20:50:50]Nox <angel> yeah but when someone sets up their trigs based on the item
[Oct 6-07 20:50:56]Nox <angel> like scripters
[Oct 6-07 20:51:6]Sik <angel> i'm actually still very upset that she made imm, i feel that she is swayed to easily by the player base
[Oct 6-07 20:51:20]Nox <angel> i agree but i still hope she does a good job
[Oct 6-07 20:51:24]<angel> Nulvect shrugs
[Oct 6-07 20:51:28]Nox <angel> all though am losing hope :\
[Oct 6-07 20:51:54]Nulvect <angel> it takes some time to figure things out
[Oct 6-07 20:52:0]Sik <angel> don't get me wrong, i wish her the best, just don't feel she has what it takes
[Oct 6-07 20:52:22]Nox <angel> yeah i think she'll crack and go off like some other imms
[Oct 6-07 20:52:38]Nox <angel> am still suprised you made it this far nul..
[Oct 6-07 20:52:54]Sik <angel> nul rocks, he can abuse from us like a champ ;)
[Oct 6-07 20:53:0]Nulvect <angel> I made it this far because coding is as fun to me as playing the game
[Oct 6-07 20:53:0]Nox <angel> am very glad don't get me wrong
[Oct 6-07 20:53:14]Nox <angel> i enjoy coding but am not smart enough to code like you guys
[Oct 6-07 20:53:28]Nox <angel> am just a nub coder :(
[Oct 6-07 20:53:56]Nulvect <angel> builders are very important, and our lack thereof is a main reason why we haven't grown much
[Oct 6-07 20:53:56]Nox <angel> i enjoy coding and i plan on adding my area one day but i would never want to give up being a player for being an immortal
[Oct 6-07 20:54:34]Sik <angel> how about an elite healing and boost spell for clerics nul?
[Oct 6-07 20:54:52]Nulvect <angel> what, bringing people back from the dead isn't elite healing??
[Oct 6-07 20:55:0]Sik <angel> oh it is
[Oct 6-07 20:55:14]Sik <angel> but something that can heal more for the higher players with asstons of hp
[Oct 6-07 20:55:42]Sik <angel> basically i'm lazy and don't want to have to cast heal a whole bunch ;)
[Oct 6-07 20:55:46]Nox <angel> i havn't been the new cleric but i never found it hard to keep them at full sp\hp
[Oct 6-07 20:55:58]Nulvect <angel> that probably just means I need to mess with cure a bit
[Oct 6-07 20:56:18]Nox <angel> i made a mistake once and didn't cure all and the person i was healing lost their torso but i learned :)
[Oct 6-07 20:57:6]Nox <angel> nulvect if and when you ever get done with all the classes then what you go over them again?
[Oct 6-07 20:57:12]Sik <angel> eh, right now i'm at 300+hp for cure, it's not bad, i'm just lazy
[Oct 6-07 20:57:14]Nox <angel> or add higher than 50 commands?
[Oct 6-07 20:57:26]Nox <angel> i think raising int helps it
[Oct 6-07 20:57:28]Sik <angel> i hope higher then 50 commands
[Oct 6-07 20:57:30]Nulvect <angel> well, there are some I think I need to go back and tweak
[Oct 6-07 20:57:46]Sik <angel> and don't forget raises/summons ;)
[Oct 6-07 20:57:54]Nulvect <angel> but yes, higher level abilities as well
[Oct 6-07 20:58:4]Nulvect <angel> of course some subs already have high level abils
[Oct 6-07 20:58:8]Nox <angel> that'll be cool just really hard to balance i think
[Oct 6-07 20:58:18]Nulvect <angel> but nobody levels much past 50 so they don't have them
[Oct 6-07 20:58:28]Nox <angel> ohh i had no idea
[Oct 6-07 20:58:44]Sik <angel> would help if we had a hint as to what classes had em :P
[Oct 6-07 20:58:50]Nox <angel> i plan on leveling past it 1 day just is a big step seeing how it could mess you up for good
[Oct 6-07 20:58:50]<angel> Nulvect shrugs
[Oct 6-07 20:58:52]Sik <angel> although i'm pretty sure wiz is one of them
[Oct 6-07 20:59:18]Nox <angel> don't think its sorc seeing how we don't even get a level 40
[Oct 6-07 20:59:22]Nox <angel> 50*
[Oct 6-07 20:59:26]Sik <angel> i had damien at 70, and nothing new from 50
[Oct 6-07 20:59:38]Nox <angel> died down?
[Oct 6-07 20:59:44]Sik <angel> yea, nothing
[Oct 6-07 20:59:52]Sik <angel> nothing to party with up there
[Oct 6-07 20:59:56]Nox <angel> yeah see thats why i don't level i hate that if you mess up dying is your only real option
[Oct 6-07 20:59:58]Sik <angel> but wicked damage on spells
[Oct 6-07 21:0:18]Nulvect <angel> ok, I'm off to make assassins gape in awe
[Oct 6-07 21:0:22]Sik <angel> soulburn was something like 1300-1400hp for 2 rounds
[Oct 6-07 21:0:34]Sik <angel> don't tell me that nul... now i'll have to switch
[Oct 6-07 21:0:40]Nox <angel> level 100 would be so sick
[Oct 6-07 21:0:50]Sik <angel> level 100 cleric :D
[Oct 6-07 21:0:54]Sik <angel> i'll get there
[Oct 6-07 21:1:0]Nox <angel> that would just be messed up :\
[Oct 6-07 21:1:8]Nox <angel> -1000 and then cure!
[Oct 6-07 21:1:12]Sik <angel> cures for 3k per cure or something :D
[Oct 6-07 21:1:36]Nox <angel> level 100 for sorc might be nice
[Oct 6-07 21:1:36]Sik <angel> 10 round para :D
[Oct 6-07 21:1:42]Nox <angel> mindshock is pretty good spell
[Oct 6-07 21:1:52]Sik <angel> it's not bad
[Oct 6-07 21:2:4]Sik <angel> don't think it should come in at such a low level though
[Oct 6-07 21:2:4]Nox <angel> omg staticshield though :\
[Oct 6-07 21:2:28]Nox <angel> i'd never get hurt!
[Oct 6-07 21:5:20]Sik <angel> there are too many good alingned mobs out there :(
[Oct 6-07 21:5:26]Nox <angel> i agree
[Oct 6-07 21:5:38]Nox <angel> and no evil mobs pretty much
[Oct 6-07 21:5:48]Nox <angel> bah if only i get done with my area someday!
[Oct 6-07 21:5:50]Sik <angel> rhon and s3
[Oct 6-07 21:6:10]Nox <angel> south of lodos too
[Oct 6-07 21:6:38]Nox <angel> just think merk should be evil but its not
[Oct 6-07 21:6:48]Sik <angel> would sure make sense if it was
[Oct 6-07 21:7:2]Nox <angel> yeah seeing how everyone worships the devil
[Oct 6-07 21:7:8]Sik <angel> ayep
[Oct 6-07 21:8:8]Nox <angel> i guess later tonight i'll try to code a lil
[Oct 6-07 21:8:20]Sik <angel> heh, not for me, can't code for !!@#
[Oct 6-07 21:8:46]Nox <angel> i can a lil but basically i just use the tirun code as examples and try to teach myself how to do mine off of it
[Oct 6-07 21:9:36]Nox <angel> sucks though because tirun doesn't exactly have a lot in it and im not allowed to touch anything else
[Oct 6-07 21:9:52]Sik <angel> yea, i've basically coded a wiz room, that's it :D
[Oct 6-07 21:10:16]Nox <angel> theres actually a program that you type in what you want and it codes it for you
[Oct 6-07 21:10:24]Sik <angel> sign me up
[Oct 6-07 21:10:24]Nox <angel> nightshade made it i think...
[Oct 6-07 21:10:34]Sik <angel> i can do ideas and areas like a machine
[Oct 6-07 21:10:44]Sik <angel> have ideas coming out the arse
[Oct 6-07 21:10:52]Nox <angel> well i mean its only basic stuff won't be like very complex code
[Oct 6-07 21:11:4]Nox <angel> yeah see i got the ideas just not the skill to code em
[Oct 6-07 21:11:8]Sik <angel> don't need complex, rooms and mobs
[Oct 6-07 21:11:32]Nox <angel> ask amun the program if you are really interested
[Oct 6-07 21:11:44]Sik <angel> eh, i'll look into it
[Oct 6-07 21:11:54]Nox <angel> and if you don't want to code your own area and you do have great ideas send em my way
[Oct 6-07 21:12:6]Nox <angel> i might change them a lil but it would still be in the game ;)
[Oct 6-07 21:12:26]Sik <angel> yea, i fed daboura a couple ideas for areas
[Oct 6-07 21:12:32]Sik <angel> not sure if he did anything for em
[Oct 6-07 21:12:36]Nox <angel> if not its cool i got a lot of ideas just really not enough time to play and code
[Oct 6-07 21:12:42]Sik <angel> one area would have been perfect for the vamp quest
[Oct 6-07 21:12:46]Nox <angel> he's working on warships
[Oct 6-07 21:12:54]Nox <angel> like battleship area or something
[Oct 6-07 21:12:56]Sik <angel> warships...
[Oct 6-07 21:13:10]Nox <angel> i dunno i only saw like 4 rooms reminded me of the ghost ship of sm
[Oct 6-07 21:13:10]Sik <angel> speaking of ships, they need to remake the whole sailing system
[Oct 6-07 21:13:14]Sik <angel> it's 'clunky'
[Oct 6-07 21:13:32]Nox <angel> yeah heard whit was gonna redo sailing system
[Oct 6-07 21:13:48]Nox <angel> just he isn't exactly active anymore so i dunno
[Oct 6-07 21:13:54]Sik <angel> yea
[Oct 6-07 21:14:38]Nox <angel> but yeah daboura had a nice area going every noun you could look at and had like a few hidden things in each room
[Oct 6-07 21:15:6]Sik <angel> every room needs to be coded with a description for every noun, every room in the mud
[Oct 6-07 21:15:18]Nox <angel> and it wasn't like ironmans area where it feels like the room describe was ripped off of a dictionary
[Oct 6-07 21:15:32]Sik <angel> the bay... don't get me started
[Oct 6-07 21:15:34]Nox <angel> yeah i agree sik
[Oct 6-07 21:15:58]Nox <angel> am going to try to make everything look able in my area but it does take a lot of time to do it
[Oct 6-07 21:16:10]Sik <angel> shows the mark of a good coder
[Oct 6-07 21:16:28]Nox <angel> but the way i see it is not worth my time coding an area if its not gonna be a great area...
[Oct 6-07 21:16:40]Nox <angel> i just hope i don't let everyone down ;)
[Oct 6-07 21:16:58]Sik <angel> eh, any area is better then no new areas
[Oct 6-07 21:17:2]Nox <angel> also ironman keeps saying how we need testers i feel the coder should test his own area
[Oct 6-07 21:17:46]Nulvect <angel> we do go over things before they go in
[Oct 6-07 21:17:58]Nox <angel> i don't mean that nul i mean of course you do
[Oct 6-07 21:18:2]Nox <angel> to make sure stuff isn't cheated
[Oct 6-07 21:18:14]Nulvect <angel> yeah, don't want another wraith...
[Oct 6-07 21:18:18]Nox <angel> i mean he wants players from pd to go onto builders and test
[Oct 6-07 21:18:32]Nulvect <angel> yeah, that's not really necessary
[Oct 6-07 21:18:32]Nox <angel> before the area is actually in
[Oct 6-07 21:18:46]Sik <angel> how close did your new area get nul?
[Oct 6-07 21:18:48]Nox <angel> thats what im saying i feel the coder should test all that himself
[Oct 6-07 21:19:0]Nulvect <angel> I agree
[Oct 6-07 21:19:16]Nulvect <angel> um... it's pretty close... I just suck at building
[Oct 6-07 21:19:26]Nox <angel> haha suck at building but rock at coding
[Oct 6-07 21:19:38]Sik <angel> i wonder if dab ever did anything with my catacomb idea
[Oct 6-07 21:20:34]Nox <angel> daboura was a pretty good coder he taught me all the basics to coding
[Oct 6-07 21:20:52]Nox <angel> and then he went all crazy because people were making fun of his hard work :\
[Oct 6-07 21:21:4]Sik <angel> everything i know about coding, which is very little because of me, i learned from kataro and void
[Oct 6-07 21:21:30]Nox <angel> doesn't ironman admin over there?
[Oct 6-07 21:21:42]Nulvect <angel> who's void??
[Oct 6-07 21:22:32]Sik <angel> void and kataro are from my old mud, but they have chars here
[Oct 6-07 21:23:4]Nulvect <angel> I remember kataro a bit, never heard of void
[Oct 6-07 21:23:50]Sik <angel> 50 mil should get me from 34 to 46 eh?
[Oct 6-07 21:23:50]Nox <angel> bah i knew void just can't remember
[Oct 6-07 21:23:54]Nox <angel> was he kevin?
[Oct 6-07 21:23:58]Sik <angel> kelvin from sm
[Oct 6-07 21:24:8]Nox <angel> ah yes i remember him
[Oct 6-07 21:24:38]Sik <angel> any chance of getting the times on shield and protect bumped up nul?
[Oct 6-07 21:24:46]Nulvect <angel> perhaps
[Oct 6-07 21:24:56]Nox <angel> i think all the buffer spells need to have time bumped up
[Oct 6-07 21:25:0]Nox <angel> mainly guard though
[Oct 6-07 21:25:4]Nulvect <angel> post some actual timing info on the cleric board and I'll look it over
[Oct 6-07 21:25:18]Sik <angel> k, and possibly the cost on protect if you just cast on yourself
[Oct 6-07 21:25:56]Nulvect <angel> clerics will be getting more def spells though, it's just the stuff I want to do can't be done yet
[Oct 6-07 21:26:2]Sik <angel> nod
[Oct 6-07 21:26:24]Nulvect <angel> oh and.. another ward too
[Oct 6-07 21:26:26]<angel> Nulvect winks
[Oct 6-07 21:26:30]Sik <angel> nice
[Oct 6-07 21:27:22]Sik <angel> i hate to mention it... but you know if i para a mob it doesn't autoattack me after he un para's
[Oct 6-07 21:27:32]Nulvect <angel> do what??
[Oct 6-07 21:27:46]Nox <angel> rofl
[Oct 6-07 21:27:48]Sik <angel> when i para a mob
[Oct 6-07 21:27:52]Sik <angel> after the para wears off
[Oct 6-07 21:27:58]Sik <angel> he doesn't attack me
[Oct 6-07 21:28:42]Sik <angel> it's kinda handy that way, but i think it might not be what you intended...
[Oct 6-07 21:29:38]Nulvect <angel> can you show me?? I can't recreate it
[Oct 6-07 21:29:42]Sik <angel> sure
[Oct 6-07 21:29:56]Sik <angel> let me know when ready
[Oct 6-07 21:30:2]Nulvect <angel> ready whenever
[Oct 6-07 21:30:22]Nulvect <angel> oh, you mean if you're not already fighting it
[Oct 6-07 21:30:26]Sik <angel> yea
[Oct 6-07 21:30:30]Nulvect <angel> yeah that's fine
[Oct 6-07 21:30:34]Sik <angel> ok rad :D
[Oct 6-07 21:30:40]Sik <angel> just wanted to make sure ;)
[Oct 6-07 21:30:44]Nulvect <angel> I don't see what kind of beneficial use that would have though
[Oct 6-07 21:31:2]Sik <angel> if i'm boosting for someone, i don't have to attack the mob to para it
[Oct 6-07 21:31:12]Sik <angel> i can just sit back and boost/para without taking damage
[Oct 6-07 21:31:18]Nox <angel> should set it up so if you para a player and it causes him to die from a mob the cleric goes outlaw (all though im not sure thats even possible)
[Oct 6-07 21:31:38]Nulvect <angel> yeah, I did that on purpose actually
[Oct 6-07 21:31:46]Sik <angel> cool, that's rad nul
[Oct 6-07 21:31:56]Nox <angel> also if you make a summon kill a player you go outlaw
[Oct 6-07 21:32:8]Nulvect <angel> _anything_ is possible
[Oct 6-07 21:32:44]Sik <angel> getting 50 mil is going to take forever
[Oct 6-07 21:32:52]Nox <angel> you going to level 50?
[Oct 6-07 21:32:52]Sik <angel> i need someone to boost...
[Oct 6-07 21:33:0]Sik <angel> well, 46 :D
[Oct 6-07 21:33:4]Nulvect <angel> I had planned on the summons thing, hadn't thought about para effects though, I'll keep that in mind
[Oct 6-07 21:33:12]Nox <angel> am guessing you plan to boost yakko?
[Oct 6-07 21:33:16]Sik <angel> ayep :D
[Oct 6-07 21:33:24]Sik <angel> and esco
[Oct 6-07 21:33:34]Nox <angel> did he say he'll party with you because i thought yakko didn't party
[Oct 6-07 21:33:34]Nulvect <angel> it's basically just hard to anticipate every way a player could cause another player to die...
[Oct 6-07 21:33:40]Nox <angel> nod
[Oct 6-07 21:33:46]Sik <angel> that's half the fun ;)
[Oct 6-07 21:34:12]Nox <angel> OH and you should set it up so if you are attacked in a law zone you do not get the -murder- charge
[Oct 6-07 21:34:16]Sik <angel> well if i can convince nul to make it so you can turn on or off the party report hing ;)
[Oct 6-07 21:34:28]<angel> Nulvect shrugs
[Oct 6-07 21:34:48]Nulvect <angel> I was actually thinking today, why is it that we can't sit or lay down while fighting
[Oct 6-07 21:34:52]Nox <angel> i mean i could just get 1 con and get weak and attack people and make them kill me
[Oct 6-07 21:35:4]Nulvect <angel> sure, it's a stupid thing to do, but it doesn't cause any problems
[Oct 6-07 21:35:18]Nox <angel> would make trip and stuff useless thats why
[Oct 6-07 21:35:52]Nulvect <angel> the point of trip is so they can't hit you, and they can't hit you if they're sitting
[Oct 6-07 21:35:56]Sik <angel> oh wait... why am i buying seals of tirun...
[Oct 6-07 21:36:6]Nox <angel> rofl
[Oct 6-07 21:37:12]Sik <angel> sorry
[Oct 6-07 21:37:14]Nulvect <angel> well nox, I've thought about letting people set whether they want to fight back when attacked, but it's a rather complicated thing
[Oct 6-07 21:37:20]Nox <angel> wasn't fighting him so its cool
[Oct 6-07 21:37:56]Nox <angel> yeah i know but it would be really useful because i know in the past i've gone outlaw twice because of it
[Oct 6-07 21:38:8]Nox <angel> and not sure if it was fixed but i know you used to go outlaw for killing an outlaw
[Oct 6-07 21:38:24]Nulvect <angel> I believe that was fixed
[Oct 6-07 21:38:28]Nox <angel> which i think is wrong because if a thief steals from me i hope that im allowed to kill em
[Oct 6-07 21:39:4]Nox <angel> if the time comes that thieves actually play
[Oct 6-07 21:39:42]Sik <angel> thieves only get outlaw if they steal and are seen right?
[Oct 6-07 21:39:46]Sik <angel> even in law zone?
[Oct 6-07 21:39:50]Nox <angel> yeah
[Oct 6-07 21:39:58]Nox <angel> so if you are pro you can get away with it
[Oct 6-07 21:40:40]Sik <angel> you going to finish these guys?
[Oct 6-07 21:41:10]Sik <angel> it's yours
[Oct 6-07 21:41:12]Nox <angel> but the more you steal the more likely you are to get caught
[Oct 6-07 21:41:20]Sik <angel> that's stupid
[Oct 6-07 21:41:26]Nox <angel> ehh kind of makes it balanced
[Oct 6-07 21:41:34]Sik <angel> the more you steal the less you should get caught
[Oct 6-07 21:41:38]Sik <angel> increasing the skill
[Oct 6-07 21:41:40]Nox <angel> i mean you couldn't just sit there and steal all someone had
[Oct 6-07 21:41:46]Nulvect <angel> you keep stuffing your hands in someone's pockets, he'll eventually notice you
[Oct 6-07 21:41:54]Sik <angel> ahh, you are talking about the same person
[Oct 6-07 21:41:56]Nox <angel> nod
[Oct 6-07 21:42:2]Sik <angel> just leave room, come back and start fresh again?
[Oct 6-07 21:42:8]Nox <angel> nah don't work like that :\
[Oct 6-07 21:42:14]Sik <angel> that's good
[Oct 6-07 21:42:22]Nox <angel> i think its they quit out start fresh again...
[Oct 6-07 21:42:38]Nulvect <angel> it's not all balanced out yet, haven't done thieves officially
[Oct 6-07 21:42:46]<angel> Sik nods.
[Oct 6-07 21:43:32]Nox <angel> i really enjoy how the thief class works so i hope not a lot will change
[Oct 6-07 21:43:42]Nox <angel> just add a few new moves and tweak a few abils :\
[Oct 6-07 21:43:50]<angel> Nox hopes for that anyay.
[Oct 6-07 21:43:56]Sik <angel> i really like wiz, but they just xp so dang slow...
[Oct 6-07 21:44:0]Nulvect <angel> thanks for pointing out that outlaw bug nox, it wasn't fixed but should be now (after boot)
[Oct 6-07 21:44:8]Nox <angel> np
[Oct 6-07 21:44:32]Nox <angel> see am not a bad guy i could have messed someone over with the outlaw bug :\
[Oct 6-07 21:47:48]Sik <angel> arena nox?
[Oct 6-07 21:48:6]Nox <angel> sure
[Oct 6-07 21:48:50]Nox <angel> nice
[Oct 6-07 21:48:58]Nox <angel> 1 more?
[Oct 6-07 21:49:2]Sik <angel> yea, i would levin... but can't do angel
[Oct 6-07 21:49:56]Nox <angel> haha para war
[Oct 6-07 21:50:4]Sik <angel> eh, i can only para so often
[Oct 6-07 21:50:6]Nox <angel> can i get a replace :\
[Oct 6-07 21:50:12]Sik <angel> yours is right after the other
[Oct 6-07 21:50:28]Nox <angel> true but yours is much much stronger
[Oct 6-07 21:50:34]Sik <angel> yea, 3 rounds
[Oct 6-07 21:50:40]Nox <angel> and mine you can still idle fight but i know that don't help mage much
[Oct 6-07 21:50:48]Sik <angel> or a cleric :P
[Oct 6-07 21:50:54]Nox <angel> meant magic user
[Oct 6-07 21:50:56]Sik <angel> nod
[Oct 6-07 21:53:20]Sik <angel> who is besides rogues and kataan that gets an invis, is it gypsy?
[Oct 6-07 21:53:32]Nox <angel> vampire and gypsy i believe
[Oct 6-07 22:0:22]Sik <angel> vamps are gonna get an invis eh
[Oct 6-07 22:0:38]Nox <angel> from what ive seen yes ;)
[Oct 6-07 22:0:44]Sik <angel> i can envision something like choke, only they suck the blood out instead of choking :D
[Oct 6-07 22:0:58]Nox <angel> help drink
[Oct 6-07 22:1:24]Sik <angel> that better raise all their stuffs, mp,sp,hp
[Oct 6-07 22:1:40]Sik <angel> if that's even what they use
[Oct 6-07 22:1:46]Nox <angel> vampire would be hella tight but from what i heard the quest is near impossible
[Oct 6-07 22:1:52]Nox <angel> which is retarded because no 1 will be it
[Oct 6-07 22:1:54]Sik <angel> well that's fun
[Oct 6-07 22:2:8]Nox <angel> ehh i mean i just hope its hard not like level 100 requirnment
[Oct 6-07 22:2:12]Sik <angel> lets make a really cool class then make it so hard that no one can become one...
[Oct 6-07 22:2:44]Sik <angel> the mud i've been playing you can start out as ANY class in the mud, ANY race, it's pretty cool
[Oct 6-07 22:2:50]Nulvect <angel> if it's not hard then we'll have as many vamps as demons and angels
[Oct 6-07 22:3:12]Nox <angel> yeah i know that i hope its very hard just hope it takes your brain to be it
[Oct 6-07 22:3:16]Nox <angel> not really levels or stats
[Oct 6-07 22:3:52]Nulvect <angel> it should be very possible to do, don't worry
[Oct 6-07 22:5:58]Sik <angel> i really want lich
[Oct 6-07 22:6:2]Sik <angel> that sounds wicked fun
[Oct 6-07 22:6:28]Nox <angel> nod i do too
[Oct 6-07 22:6:44]Sik <angel> and i've always wanted to play a dragon
[Oct 20-07 21:40:57]Warrick <angel> sniff
[Oct 26-07 3:31:58]Oz <angel> hrm.
[Nov 20-07 23:43:27]Sik <angel> any chance of getting the elite racial abils back in nul?
[Nov 20-07 23:50:17]Nulvect <angel> well.. I really consider fly to be the most useful out of all of them... and I'm not sure angels' second racial should be an attack spell
[Nov 20-07 23:56:44]Sik <angel> it would really help us clerics out ;)
[Nov 20-07 23:57:0]Sik <angel> and for a cleric, levin would be the most useful
[Nov 21-07 0:6:58]Nulvect <angel> I am not concerned about clerics having strong attacks
[Nov 21-07 0:7:4]Sik <angel> i know :P
[Nov 21-07 0:7:22]Sik <angel> i wont tell you what my levin does against demons ;)
[Nov 21-07 0:7:44]Sik <angel> well let me rephrase that, demon players, mobs seem to be way different
[Nov 21-07 0:9:26]Sik <angel> what really hurts us clerics is that there aren't many people around to party with
[Nov 21-07 0:9:46]Sik <angel> so while it is nice to have good healing and boosting, not super useful without a larger player base
[Jan 18-08 16:39:48]Uzamaki <angel> we fly high...no lie...
[Jan 18-08 16:39:54]Uzamaki <angel> >:)

[Jun 17-08 2:46:41]<angel> Sik laughs.
[Jun 22-08 15:39:58]Halucoost <angel> I dont understand how it lowers your stats to become a quest race
[Jun 22-08 15:40:40]Geddoe <angel> because your going back to level 1?
[Jun 22-08 15:40:48]Geddoe <angel> so basically your starting your life over again
[Jun 22-08 15:40:58]Geddoe <angel> your not in your old body anymore
[Jun 22-08 15:41:22]Halucoost <angel> I had 50str -> 12 now 55dex -> 18now 50char -> 35 now 50con -> 17 now
[Jun 22-08 15:41:34]Geddoe <angel> angel lose 75% of str/dex/con
[Jun 22-08 15:41:40]Geddoe <angel> no
[Jun 22-08 15:41:42]Geddoe <angel> 2/3
[Jun 22-08 15:41:50]Geddoe <angel> they lose 1/3 of charisma/int/wis
[Jun 22-08 15:41:56]Geddoe <angel> its opposite for demons
[Jun 22-08 15:42:8]Halucoost <angel> lol always wanted to know how that worked
[Jun 22-08 15:42:20]Halucoost <angel> its lame though for physical users
[Jun 22-08 15:42:34]Geddoe <angel> your gonna use a cleric?
[Jun 22-08 15:42:50]Halucoost <angel> Yeah that was always my intentions
[Jun 22-08 15:43:0]Geddoe <angel> indeed
[Jun 22-08 15:43:0]Halucoost <angel> I think we talked about it last week?
[Jun 22-08 15:43:10]Geddoe <angel> maybe
[Jun 22-08 15:43:26]Geddoe <angel> you goin straight to elite?
[Jun 22-08 15:43:32]Halucoost <angel> nope
[Jun 22-08 15:47:50]Geddoe <angel> get a little bit of healing
[Jun 22-08 15:47:54]Geddoe <angel> then use bash
[Jun 22-08 15:47:56]Geddoe <angel> until dispell
[Jun 22-08 15:48:0]Geddoe <angel> then fight evil mobs
[Jun 22-08 15:48:2]Geddoe <angel> like demons
[Jun 22-08 15:48:32]Halucoost <angel> lol I just thought it was weird I dont have any moves but jab and spells are boost and heal
[Jun 22-08 15:48:54]Geddoe <angel> you have jab??
[Jun 22-08 15:49:10]Halucoost <angel> no I meant bump lol

[Jul 8-08 21:21:46]Nulvect <angel> haven't done it at all today
[Jul 8-08 21:21:52]Geddoe <angel> lol
[Jul 8-08 21:22:42]Nulvect <angel> it depends - if I have a concern about a spell/abil (like if it's new, or people are reporting problems) I often watch people use it
[Jul 8-08 21:22:48]Geddoe <angel> nod
[Jul 8-08 21:22:52]Nulvect <angel> sometimes I just watch people exp at random to get a better idea how things are working
[Jul 8-08 21:23:0]Geddoe <angel> nod nod

[Jul 8-08 21:23:30]Geddoe <angel> do i give you a headache when i xp from all the speedwalking?
[Jul 8-08 21:23:56]Nulvect <angel> it's not a headache, just fills my scroll buffer

[Jul 8-08 21:40:52]Nulvect <angel> I check idle time and have an alias to tell me where you are, so I can get people when they're exping more often than not

[Oct 10-08 11:40:53]Scoff <angel> Uzmaki was trying to get me to remort Orcha into somthing else, via rez
[Oct 10-08 11:41:45]Scoff <angel> I dont think it would work
[Oct 10-08 11:42:1]Cyan <angel> why leave dragon?! you worked so hard on it
[Oct 10-08 11:42:19]Scoff <angel> thats what i figured
[Oct 10-08 11:42:35]Cyan <angel> I think you made right choice with an alt, lol
[Oct 10-08 11:42:41]Scoff <angel> ?
[Oct 10-08 11:42:47]Scoff <angel> ah, scoffs old as hell
[Oct 10-08 11:42:59]Scoff <angel> had this dude for a while
[Oct 10-08 11:43:31]Cyan <angel> I know, you showed me that one night
[Oct 10-08 11:43:45]Scoff <angel> i c
[Oct 10-08 11:43:49]Cyan <angel> Im just saying, going to him, instead of taking away Orcha's draggieness
[Oct 10-08 11:43:57]Scoff <angel> oh, yeah
[Oct 10-08 11:44:3]Scoff <angel> i wasnt going to do it :p
[Oct 10-08 11:44:27]Scoff <angel> i think i need somthing thats a bit faster to play tho... this charge stuff is kinda slow :p
[Oct 10-08 11:44:45]Cyan <angel> yeah, I don't even use charge much anymore.. lol
[Oct 10-08 11:44:55]Cyan <angel> 3 round idle blows
[Oct 10-08 11:45:39]Scoff <angel> am not going to lvl past 19 tho
[Oct 10-08 11:45:45]Cyan <angel> ever?
[Oct 10-08 11:45:57]Scoff <angel> well, not in the next 10 years lets say
[Oct 10-08 11:46:15]Cyan <angel> lol!
[Oct 10-08 11:46:33]Scoff <angel> still a chance i might level past but not very soon
[Oct 10-08 11:47:27]Scoff <angel> whats so fast about swashies?
[Oct 10-08 11:47:45]Cyan <angel> they just have more moves
[Oct 10-08 11:47:55]Scoff <angel> ahh
[Oct 10-08 11:48:3]Cyan <angel> if you want caster, I would say kataan, sorc, or pyro
[Oct 10-08 11:48:15]Cyan <angel> they fun
[Oct 10-08 11:48:25]Scoff <angel> but prolly not v.good at lvl19 :p
[Oct 10-08 11:49:3]Cyan <angel> well, Ive never played kataan or pyro
[Oct 10-08 11:49:11]Cyan <angel> but sorc is good, you have dissolve at lvl 19 I believe
[Oct 10-08 11:49:13]Scoff <angel> i have :p
[Oct 10-08 11:49:17]Cyan <angel> I lvled on it forever
[Oct 10-08 11:49:29]Cyan <angel> then go rogue :p
[Oct 10-08 11:49:47]Scoff <angel> people keep tlaking up Levin
[Oct 10-08 11:49:53]Scoff <angel> you know if monk is any good?
[Oct 10-08 11:50:17]Cyan <angel> not personally
[Oct 10-08 11:50:23]Cyan <angel> but levein is awesome
[Oct 10-08 11:50:29]Scoff <angel> nods
[Oct 10-08 11:50:39]Scoff <angel> lvl25 tho :p
[Oct 10-08 11:50:41]Cyan <angel> but, Im not sure about monk
[Oct 10-08 11:50:45]Cyan <angel> yeah
[Oct 10-08 11:51:7]Scoff <angel> levin used Faith for dmg?
[Oct 10-08 11:51:33]Cyan <angel> faith and wisdom I eblieve
[Oct 10-08 11:51:37]Scoff <angel> nods
[Oct 10-08 11:51:51]Cyan <angel> on the sorc remort of cyan here
[Oct 10-08 11:52:3]Cyan <angel> I can 3 round 35k with psistorm
[Oct 10-08 11:52:9]Scoff <angel> nice
[Oct 10-08 11:52:9]Cyan <angel> levin will take them in 1-2 rounds
[Oct 10-08 11:52:27]Cyan <angel> thats the biggest difference in skill powers Ive seen
[Oct 10-08 11:52:43]Scoff <angel> nods
[Oct 10-08 11:53:15]Cyan <angel> finally have something close to gore
[Oct 10-08 11:53:31]Scoff <angel> ? from what I have seen gore sucks
[Oct 10-08 11:53:57]Cyan <angel> yeah, they debuffed it
[Oct 10-08 11:54:15]Cyan <angel> but, the ones who are demons now, are power classes.. so yes, gore does suck to thier other abils
[Oct 10-08 11:54:31]Cyan <angel> they're just not used to gore not doing twice the dmg of charge, etc
[Oct 10-08 11:54:48]Scoff <angel> ahh
[Oct 10-08 11:55:6]Cyan <angel> I remember, back in the day.. I watched a demon with only 165 str, one rounding drow caverns, with gore
[Oct 10-08 11:55:20]Scoff <angel> :X
[Oct 10-08 11:56:30]Scoff <angel> might try the monk remort i have on this char

[Oct 10-08 11:58:34]Cyan <angel> hehe
[Oct 10-08 11:58:44]Cyan <angel> ah, ointments aint that expensive

[Mar 25-09 6:4:2]Scoff <angel> not sure, only reason i trained it higher on orcha was for swoop
[Mar 25-09 6:4:14]Scoff <angel> might lower flight sp cost?

[Oct 4-09 15:36:38]Yun <angel> always thought using evil supplies would make your alignment off too
[Oct 4-09 15:44:26]Stormbringer <angel> interesting idea

[Jul 20-10 9:3:16]Cyan <angel> yo, whats up Uza?
[Jul 20-10 9:3:28]Uzamaki <angel> u read about levin?
[Jul 20-10 9:3:34]Cyan <angel> nup
[Jul 20-10 9:3:42]Uzamaki <angel> on angel board, posdt 8
[Jul 20-10 9:3:52]Uzamaki <angel> s'been 'rebalanced'
[Jul 20-10 9:4:14]Cyan <angel> heh
[Jul 20-10 9:4:40]Cyan <angel> I never used levin anyhow
[Jul 20-10 9:4:54]Uzamaki <angel> as a druid, is my bread and butter
[Jul 20-10 9:5:0]Cyan <angel> true
[Jul 20-10 9:5:14]Cyan <angel> angel is mainly for the stat costs for me
[Jul 20-10 9:5:20]Cyan <angel> demons get quite a bit
[Jul 20-10 9:5:26]<angel> Uzamaki feels banished to the eye of hell for levin ta hit hard
[Jul 20-10 9:5:32]Cyan <angel> took me a long ass time to get them to listen to me on how strong gore used to be
[Jul 29-10 0:42:12]Geddoe <angel> you thoguht levin was too strong? boo :(
[Jul 29-10 0:42:28]Nulvect <angel> it was
[Jul 29-10 0:42:48]Geddoe <angel> i dont see how
[Jul 29-10 0:43:8]Geddoe <angel> sucks vs players who have put any amount of time in their character...and can't be used effectively vs the best xp areas
[Jul 29-10 0:43:34]Nulvect <angel> I think you were using a skewed way of comparing it
[Jul 29-10 0:43:38]Geddoe <angel> and now its useless vs piehl, even though i have more wisdom than he does
[Jul 29-10 0:44:22]Nulvect <angel> "useless" doesn't tell me much
[Jul 29-10 0:44:24]Geddoe <angel> woosp forgot to switch to cleric, one sec
[Jul 29-10 0:45:36]Geddoe <angel> bah...cant even auto a 25k with it now
[Jul 29-10 0:45:44]Geddoe <angel> with 172 wisdom feels liek i should
[Jul 29-10 0:45:48]Yun <angel> hrmm
[Jul 29-10 0:45:56]Yun <angel> that dont sound right
[Jul 29-10 0:46:14]Geddoe <angel> 172 wisdom, max skills level 34
[Jul 29-10 0:46:18]Nulvect <angel> that's odd because I tested it thoroughly and even against mobs above neutral it was doing more than average damage
[Jul 29-10 0:46:30]Geddoe <angel> i can show you if you'd like, im not autoing 25k
[Jul 29-10 0:46:36]Yun <angel> ged is broken
[Jul 29-10 0:46:42]Yun <angel> make him stronger pls
[Jul 29-10 0:46:46]Geddoe <angel> and im godly
[Jul 29-10 0:46:50]Yun <angel> hey now
[Jul 29-10 0:46:58]Yun <angel> oooh your alighnment
[Jul 29-10 0:47:32]Nulvect <angel> how about you actually kill one of those mobs
[Jul 29-10 0:47:46]Geddoe <angel> what does that matter?
[Jul 29-10 0:47:56]Geddoe <angel> if it didnt kill them in one round, im not 1rounding them :P
[Jul 29-10 0:48:18]Nulvect <angel> we don't balance vs what you can kill in one round
[Jul 29-10 0:48:24]Geddoe <angel> im aware
[Jul 29-10 0:48:34]Geddoe <angel> but i SHOULD be able to kill a 25k in one round with 172 wisdom
[Jul 29-10 0:48:50]Geddoe <angel> hell, only takes like 60 dex to backstab a 25k
[Jul 29-10 0:49:27]Nulvect <angel> so it takes you 2 hits
[Jul 29-10 0:49:30]Geddoe <angel> yeah
[Jul 29-10 0:49:30]Nulvect <angel> to kill these 25k mobs
[Jul 29-10 0:49:48]Nulvect <angel> and that makes it useless
[Jul 29-10 0:49:59]Geddoe <angel> makes me incredibly slow
[Jul 29-10 0:50:7]Geddoe <angel> takes 17mil per point to make it stronger
[Jul 29-10 0:51:11]Geddoe <angel> its fine, just ignore it
[Jul 29-10 0:51:30]Geddoe <angel> on another note
[Jul 29-10 0:51:44]Geddoe <angel> any chance of getting the second remort per reboot fixed?
[Jul 29-10 0:51:52]Yun <angel> nod
[Jul 29-10 0:52:58]Nulvect <angel> I'll look into it

[Oct 31-10 16:18:46]<angel> Methvia chuckles
[Oct 31-10 16:18:56]Aethion <angel> free to do what you wish :)
[Oct 31-10 16:19:6]Aethion <angel> gives me a reason to stay buff, I wanna always be the strongest monk :P
[Oct 31-10 16:19:14]<angel> Methvia laughs

[Dec 1-10 23:48:38]Amon <angel> ah
[Dec 1-10 23:48:56]Nulvect <angel> just look in the first room you had to do anything
[Dec 2-10 0:3:57]Amon <angel> did you say another angel can restore my halo, too?
[Dec 2-10 0:11:49]Nulvect <angel> don't think so
[Dec 2-10 0:11:53]Amon <angel> dnag it
[Jan 24-11 2:0:14]Enska <angel> Just wondering.. is smite the new paladins ability/spell?

[Mar 1-11 8:21:54]Uzamaki <angel> Hey Thaedrin
[Mar 1-11 8:22:10]Thaedrin <angel> ?
[Mar 4-11 18:29:57]Yun <angel> man thinking of a holy description isnt easy
[Mar 4-11 18:30:41]Yun <angel> every descript i come up with ends up to be a bassage from "Children of the Corn"
[Mar 4-11 18:30:51]<angel> Thaedrin grins
[Mar 4-11 18:31:7]<angel> Stormbringer sings your my angel...
[Mar 4-11 18:31:11]Thaedrin <angel> that movie scared the !@#! out of me when I was little
[Mar 4-11 18:31:19]Yun <angel> hehe
[May 1-11 10:28:39]Enska <angel> Nul, do i lose all remorts if i go demon?
[May 1-11 10:43:56]Nulvect <angel> you lose stuff, that's as much info as you'll be getting
[May 1-11 10:44:24]Enska <angel> :/
[May 1-11 10:45:34]Enska <angel> I dont mind if i lose lvl 55 druid for demon.. but if i lose all remorts it aint worth it :(
[Sep 19-11 0:9:25]El <angel> word
[Sep 23-11 19:40:59]El <angel> yun your yucky
[Sep 23-11 19:41:15]El <angel> makes you yunky

[Feb 8-12 0:13:26]Geddoe <angel> hrmm was the bell syntax changed?
[Feb 8-12 0:13:34]Geddoe <angel> don't I need to be able to crash it to get back into angel hall?
[Feb 8-12 0:13:35]Solas <angel> ascend
[Feb 8-12 0:13:40]Geddoe <angel> ah there we go
[Feb 8-12 0:13:47]Geddoe <angel> can you do that from anywhere?
[Feb 8-12 0:13:55]Solas <angel> no
[Feb 8-12 0:14:0]Geddoe <angel> ah kk
[Feb 8-12 0:14:0]Solas <angel> should be able to
[Feb 8-12 0:14:6]Solas <angel> cause remort makes it tough
[Feb 8-12 0:14:9]Solas <angel> on angels
[Feb 8-12 0:14:32]Geddoe <angel> i think just from tirun square would be alright
[Feb 8-12 0:14:37]Geddoe <angel> since thats where the halo takes you anyway
[Feb 8-12 0:14:43]Geddoe <angel> since we lose our halo whenever we remort
[Feb 8-12 0:14:44]Solas <angel> nod
