[Feb 7-06 20:9:39]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ having a tad of trouble with the spacing of spells thogh
[Feb 7-06 20:10:3]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but so far 2 whole spells have made the cut!
[Feb 7-06 20:10:9]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ unlike wizard :P
[Feb 7-06 20:10:33]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ from how I see things shaping up, it might be in a fighters best intrest to be paired with a druid
[Feb 7-06 20:10:51]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ...
[Feb 7-06 20:10:59]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that kidna sounds...wierd...
[Feb 7-06 20:11:3]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i hope we arent going to be more supportive class
[Feb 7-06 20:11:19]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i dont like supporting people i like beating people up :P
[Feb 7-06 20:11:27]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, I'm hoping that with the right mix, you'll be able to survive until you get wildshape
[Feb 7-06 20:11:45]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ how does detect work...
[Feb 7-06 20:11:57]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ don't know, never used it
[Feb 7-06 20:12:3]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what different property types are there...magical...draining...im confused :s
[Feb 7-06 20:12:17]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ anyway, i'll bbl
[Feb 7-06 20:12:23]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ survive until we get wildshape?
[Feb 7-06 20:12:33]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so we will be good until then, and once we have wildshape we will suck?
[Feb 7-06 20:12:51]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ err, did you mean that backwards ax?
[Feb 7-06 20:12:57]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no...
[Feb 7-06 20:12:59]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ did you?
[Feb 7-06 20:13:1]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nope
[Feb 7-06 20:13:9]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i think you read it wrong then :P
[Feb 7-06 20:13:13]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you said exactly what i did right?
[Feb 7-06 20:13:25]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you said we will be able to survive UNTIL we get wildhspae
[Feb 7-06 20:13:35]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ meaning once we get wildshape, we wnt be able to survive anymore?
[Feb 7-06 20:13:37]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yes, you clearly interpreted it wrong :P
[Feb 7-06 20:14:3]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ how did you mean it then
[Feb 7-06 20:14:23]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I meant you should be able to make ends-meat until you get wildshap
[Feb 7-06 20:14:27]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ *wildshap
[Feb 7-06 20:14:31]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ DOH!
[Feb 7-06 20:15:1]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ...
[Feb 7-06 20:15:17]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so in other words yes, we will be good until wildshape
[Feb 7-06 20:15:27]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so what happens to us after wildshape then
[Feb 7-06 20:15:35]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ we get even better?
[Feb 7-06 20:15:43]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ wow ax
[Feb 7-06 20:15:53]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ @#!!#!##@!@!@#@#@@@@#!#!@#
[Feb 7-06 20:15:55]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ bah
[Feb 7-06 20:15:59]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ me thinks you need to pay a littlre more attention in english :P
[Feb 7-06 20:16:3]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that art exactly what you saying
[Feb 7-06 20:16:13]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ then can you please tell me what you mean by it then
[Feb 7-06 20:16:19]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you are reading it wrong!
[Feb 7-06 20:16:23]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ instead of saying the same thing twice which we have established is confusing
[Feb 7-06 20:16:33]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you said UNTIL we get wildshape
[Feb 7-06 20:16:35]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if one is *surviving* one is just barely making it
[Feb 7-06 20:16:39]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ meaning it will change1
[Feb 7-06 20:16:51]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and the opposite of good is bad!
[Feb 7-06 20:17:13]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ then why not just say you wont be good until wildshape then you will get better
[Feb 7-06 20:17:21]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and by defining wildshape as the time when you stop *surviving* that means that you'll have ample power with the ability
[Feb 7-06 20:17:29]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ because my way sounds better!
[Feb 7-06 20:18:5]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ bah
[Feb 7-06 20:18:9]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ opinion!

[Feb 7-06 20:18:17]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nope!
[Feb 7-06 20:18:45]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ your way might be better to you but if you would have said it the -right- way it would be easier :)
[Feb 7-06 20:19:31]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ pishaw, right way :P
[Feb 7-06 20:19:43]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and any normal person would thing that if you stop surviving, that means your dead
[Feb 7-06 20:19:49]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just becaue you can't understand the subtlties of the english languages doens't mean it was wrong :P

[Feb 15-06 20:19:7]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ at 50 it will heal about 200 maybe
[Feb 15-06 20:19:9]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ tops
[Feb 15-06 20:19:11]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ can i have boost instead then?
[Feb 15-06 20:19:17]Aximili %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but that was my cleric, he has much more healing
[Feb 16-06 19:14:20]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i think supplication may be bugged...it wore off, and i still have the bonuses to stats
[Feb 16-06 19:15:44]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh...now i know where the bug was...
[Feb 16-06 19:16:6]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ eheheh, hope an admin/imm pay attention to me soon ^_^ (gotta be sure not to do that anymore)
[Feb 16-06 19:16:58]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ xellos, rather than waiting for an imm/admin to pay attention bug report it
[Feb 16-06 19:17:22]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ after im done this xp run
[Feb 16-06 19:17:44]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ plus...i gotta test it out again, just to be sure thats what caused it for sure...it coulda just been a one-time glitch too
[Feb 16-06 19:18:34]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yea...definately bugged...
[Feb 16-06 19:18:38]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ 2 for 2 tries...
[Feb 16-06 19:18:46]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Xellos won't do it anymore!  just had to be sure
[Feb 16-06 19:19:8]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ eh...uh oh...now i really did somethin...last time, it left when my ironman wore off...not this time...
[Feb 16-06 19:19:34]Daos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah... don't advise you to be testing out a bug after you know it is a bug, that can get you rid
[Feb 16-06 19:19:42]Hepualahaole %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm, is iron nicknamed :P
[Feb 16-06 19:20:24]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no...the bug is this.  i use supplication, and then ironman.  when supplication wears off, the stat bonuses stay as long as ironman is in place.  but ironman alone does not give those beneficial stats.  however this time, the stats didnt leave with ironman.
[Feb 16-06 19:20:42]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ stats left now tho...its wierd...and i was just making sure it actually was buggy, and i wasnt personally buggin out Daos...
[Feb 16-06 19:21:22]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Daos nods, just saying though that it is abusing a bug when you are aware it is a bug and keep triggering it
[Feb 16-06 19:21:42]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i know, im not even using supplication anymore now.  just to be safe
[Feb 16-06 19:21:48]Xellos %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or ironman for that matter

[Feb 19-06 13:38:33]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Armageddon was made before the policy but someone cided him and he remade and the imms made him change his name
[Feb 19-06 13:40:45]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the only way to change your name is to 'cide and remake

[Feb 19-06 13:41:25]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ *nods
[Feb 19-06 13:41:41]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Thats why if you go to the voting place there is the name armageddon there
[Feb 19-06 13:41:45]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Because arma is armageddon
[Feb 19-06 13:41:57]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i made Nekorb while 2 imms were logged on, they said nothing advanced him to L10 with max skills, and i was told to 'cide him
[Feb 19-06 13:42:11]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Well thats bull
[Feb 19-06 13:42:13]Raol %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh broken backwards

[Feb 19-06 13:42:49]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Whit is the only one who can change names
[Feb 19-06 13:42:59]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Thats what I was told
[Feb 19-06 13:43:29]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if they had a naming filter like they have a swearing filter, things would be all good...
[Feb 19-06 13:44:33]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ The name policy should just be take out. Thats what I think at least
[Feb 19-06 13:45:13]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Names that are stupid like hell or dieyouidiot shouldn't be aloud to use but the name "Akira" or "Armageddon" there is nothing wrong with those.
[Feb 19-06 13:45:55]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ th funny part about Nekorb, was that i didn't even realize that is was broken backwards until about L5
[Feb 19-06 13:46:21]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ he was necromancer, Nek = necro / orb = mage
[Feb 19-06 13:46:29]Victor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ lol

[Feb 23-06 23:47:18]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kataan imp summon used to cast missile and shock..now he can't cast anything... could you maybe fix that??
[Feb 23-06 23:47:52]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod nod
[Feb 23-06 23:48:16]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ xiexie
[Feb 23-06 23:49:28]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ok, he should be fixed
[Feb 23-06 23:50:10]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ still won't cast
[Feb 23-06 23:50:50]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it mght take a reboot
[Feb 23-06 23:51:4]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm k
[Feb 23-06 23:51:12]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ did you make a new one?
[Feb 23-06 23:51:16]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah
[Feb 23-06 23:51:34]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ shock was a purely wizard spell, so he's probably set to be a wizard
[Feb 23-06 23:51:44]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yah, I chnged that
[Feb 23-06 23:56:38]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm so far he'll cast magicmissile, tremble, and shockwave
[Feb 23-06 23:56:52]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ reveal powers still shows missile shock and focus though
[Feb 23-06 23:56:58]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ update again
[Feb 23-06 23:57:16]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah, he does have shockwave eh
[Feb 23-06 23:59:28]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well that was pretty
[Feb 23-06 23:59:40]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ he can cast guard as well
[Feb 24-06 0:1:56]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thanks
[Feb 24-06 0:2:18]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ aye
[Mar 3-06 14:31:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so dab, are druids getting completely redone like wizards, or are they keeping some of their old stuff (bolt, lash, thornwrack, vinearmour, etc)??
[Mar 3-06 14:32:36]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ completly redone, they are keeping freeze, only because I like that spell. They will also be keeping wildshape, but it will be radiclly different
[Mar 3-06 14:32:50]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh
[Mar 3-06 14:33:16]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I wanted to turn druid into more of a support class
[Mar 3-06 14:33:28]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ might have to break mine out eventually then
[Mar 3-06 14:33:32]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hehe, aye
[Mar 3-06 14:33:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh, so more healing and buffs??
[Mar 3-06 14:33:50]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ more buffs, a lot of buffs
[Mar 3-06 14:34:2]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ wasn't that what you were going to do with clerics??
[Mar 3-06 14:34:14]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no, I'm going for more healing type spells with cleric
[Mar 3-06 14:34:20]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah
[Mar 3-06 14:34:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, all sounds good
[Mar 3-06 14:34:32]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and someday, expact kataan to be something like the opposite of it
[Mar 3-06 14:34:44]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ debuffs and life force sucking
[Mar 3-06 14:34:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I've been trying to get us more physical abilities for ages
[Mar 3-06 14:35:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so I shouldn't bother with the str or attack skill too much I guess
[Mar 3-06 14:35:50]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh no, I want to do something kinda like wizard, with the combo stuff
[Mar 3-06 14:36:4]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so  want to mix spell and physical attacks combos
[Mar 3-06 14:36:20]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahhhh
[Mar 3-06 14:36:34]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ of course, I have no idea how I'm going to do that right now :P
[Mar 3-06 14:36:54]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I'd be glad to code up some prototype abils
[Mar 3-06 14:37:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ actually I have two sitting on builders but they're just so-so
[Mar 3-06 14:37:14]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kataan abilities eh
[Mar 3-06 14:37:18]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ folder?
[Mar 3-06 14:37:42]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ /wizards/rull/spells/, the two that start with _dak
[Mar 3-06 14:37:50]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ aye, spotted em
[Mar 3-06 14:38:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the one that hits multiple mobs is too strong, I know
[Mar 3-06 14:38:38]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, any dmg formulas you have would be removed anyway, so I wouldn't worry about that
[Mar 3-06 14:39:16]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just don't want anyone to think I'm trying to superpower my favorite sub
[Mar 3-06 14:39:38]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ LOL, no doubt
[Mar 3-06 14:39:48]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, what I want to do with kataan is kinda unique
[Mar 3-06 14:39:58]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I don't know if you know how I altered balance
[Mar 3-06 14:40:20]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I split up physical dmg formulas from magic formulas
[Mar 3-06 14:40:34]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I want kataan to be a cross-section of the 2
[Mar 3-06 14:40:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Mar 3-06 14:41:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well if you want to take the time to describe things, I'm sure I could code them
[Mar 3-06 14:41:22]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but you probably don't want a player doing that anyway, shrug
[Mar 3-06 14:41:50]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, since you woudn't know the damages, I dont think it would be a problem
[Mar 3-06 14:42:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ more than willing if it'll speed up the class fixes
[Mar 3-06 14:42:46]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i tell yah what, I'll write some stuff up then mudmail them to you
[Mar 3-06 14:42:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ok
[Mar 3-06 14:42:58]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and you can do what you wish with the ideas
[Mar 3-06 14:43:44]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thanks for the opportunity
[Mar 3-06 14:43:56]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no prob, just remember, I like colors, hehehe
[Mar 3-06 14:44:32]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I gathered that from the wizard spells
[Mar 3-06 14:45:8]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hehe
[Mar 8-06 18:16:53]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hrm

[Mar 8-06 19:58:13]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ one is an attack spell, the other is a para
[Mar 8-06 19:58:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh
[Mar 8-06 19:59:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe I'll write that cleric spell after I finish what I'm working on
[Mar 8-06 19:59:59]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hehe, maybe I can have you redo that class too :P
[Mar 8-06 20:0:13]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I need as much help as I can get
[Mar 8-06 20:1:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the most efficient way of doing it though would be to add some code in the add_sp() function which I can't do
[Mar 8-06 20:1:41]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Nulvect shrugs
[Mar 8-06 20:2:7]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not hard to do
[Mar 8-06 20:3:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe I'll write it right now actually
[Mar 8-06 20:4:9]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hehe
[Mar 8-06 20:4:22]Sanske %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nada new? or i just need to lvl more?

[Mar 8-06 22:31:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ dab, on builders vigor (that cleric spell) is all ready to check out, stuff you'd need to change is at the top of it
[Mar 8-06 22:32:5]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod nod, thanks

[Mar 9-06 19:8:38]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh
[Mar 9-06 19:8:50]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ totally different idea i had in mind
[Mar 9-06 19:8:58]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the new druid is almost done!
[Mar 9-06 19:8:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ sp drain would be more kataan
[Mar 9-06 19:9:8]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh

[Mar 9-06 19:9:32]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I had an idea for special legend spells/abilities.
[Mar 9-06 19:9:56]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ we talking like it will be done in minutes, or like a day or two?
[Mar 9-06 19:9:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what kind of idea
[Mar 9-06 19:9:58]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ each subclass would get 1 legend ability/spell unique to it's class, and be tailored to that classes strong point
[Mar 9-06 19:10:18]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that sounds good
[Mar 9-06 19:10:24]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ skunk: depends if I can stay motivated
[Mar 9-06 19:10:34]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you should be
[Mar 9-06 19:10:36]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Skunk shuts everyone up and let's Dab work.
[Mar 9-06 19:10:50]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ as an example, the druid would get an ultimate buff, and a cleric would get the ultimate heal
[Mar 9-06 19:11:10]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ legend? as in L100?
[Mar 9-06 19:11:14]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ aye
[Mar 9-06 19:11:20]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i like it

[Mar 9-06 19:12:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ furry... feet??
[Mar 9-06 19:12:22]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well that sounds like a great idea to me dab
[Mar 9-06 19:12:24]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ furystrike, furryfeet? dunno ;)
[Mar 9-06 19:12:30]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ motivation to level
[Mar 9-06 19:12:46]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ for sure
[Mar 9-06 19:12:50]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ cool, so you can go ahead and think of the ultimate kataan spell
[Mar 9-06 19:12:54]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no one staying at 56 anymore
[Mar 9-06 19:13:2]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Mar 9-06 19:13:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so instantly kill everything in the room of alignment +200 or higher
[Mar 9-06 19:13:32]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ LOL
[Mar 9-06 19:14:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or maybe not
[Mar 9-06 19:14:24]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well
[Mar 9-06 19:14:42]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I need you think what a kataan can do best
[Mar 9-06 19:14:56]Sinan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ keeeeeel
[Mar 9-06 19:15:30]Sinan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you know what would be cool for clerics? something that heals for all hp and sp
[Mar 9-06 19:15:44]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and mp!
[Mar 9-06 19:15:48]Sinan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nah no mp
[Mar 9-06 19:15:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I'm going to make kataan spells that turn on you if your alignment is too high
[Mar 9-06 19:15:56]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ cool
[Mar 9-06 19:16:2]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ouch sounds cool tho
[Mar 9-06 19:17:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yours sounded like a decent one for the legend spell to me sinan
[Mar 9-06 19:17:54]Sinan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ was meant for this line dab ;)
[Mar 9-06 19:17:54]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I had an idea for their spell
[Mar 9-06 19:18:2]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ a spell that would cure everyone on the mud
[Mar 9-06 19:18:16]Sinan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what if you don't want to cure everyone...
[Mar 9-06 19:18:24]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ god that does sound genius!
[Mar 9-06 19:18:30]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ than your not a saintly cleric
[Mar 9-06 19:18:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I assume clerics will still have one or two attack spells
[Mar 9-06 19:19:0]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ everyone would like pay you gold and this circle of healing for everyone on this mud gets stronger
[Mar 9-06 19:19:29]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yes
[Mar 9-06 19:19:37]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I'm not going to leave them defenseless

[Mar 10-06 11:59:32]Ceril %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ might want to change the help for wildshape
[Mar 10-06 11:59:48]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it doesn't exsist anymore

[Mar 10-06 12:0:38]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ almost
[Mar 10-06 12:0:44]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the bear needs some work
[Mar 10-06 12:0:52]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and the wolf needs 1 more ability
[Mar 10-06 12:1:0]Ceril %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ multiple abils.. wow
[Mar 10-06 12:1:2]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but the lion is more or less done
[Mar 10-06 12:4:0]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ might I suggest you raise conjuring
[Mar 10-06 12:4:14]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I will when I play this char
[Mar 10-06 12:4:20]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod nod
[Mar 10-06 12:4:20]Pharoah %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that was my first thought :P
[Mar 10-06 12:4:28]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ conj did almost nothing before so I didn't bother

[Mar 10-06 12:12:24]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's a fun place
[Mar 10-06 12:12:30]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, husk is a low level spell and it protects better than vinearmour
[Mar 10-06 12:12:38]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod nod
[Mar 10-06 12:13:2]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ doesn't seem like the best way to do it, heh
[Mar 10-06 12:13:50]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I left it largly unchanged, guess I'll have to just change it than
[Mar 10-06 12:14:18]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what an odd spell.....
[Mar 10-06 12:14:22]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's odd, I did vinearmour first and it only raised my armour one notch
[Mar 10-06 12:14:32]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ then I did husk and it raised it about 3 notches
[Mar 10-06 12:14:40]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ then vinearmour wore off and I'm back to one notch
[Mar 10-06 12:14:46]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ there is a random componet to it it seems
[Mar 10-06 12:16:0]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ this spell shouldn't even work....
[Mar 10-06 12:16:12]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Mar 10-06 12:16:24]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh well..... I'll have to remake it
[Mar 10-06 12:16:30]Pharoah %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you broke it :P
[Mar 10-06 12:17:6]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nah
[Mar 10-06 12:17:14]Daboura %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I really didn't change it much
[Mar 10-06 12:18:10]Ceril %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so close.. list almost done...
[Mar 10-06 13:4:14]Pharoah %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ these spells dont cost enough MP daboura
[Mar 10-06 13:53:34]Pharoah %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ we get any area spells dabby ??
[Mar 10-06 13:53:38]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no
[Mar 10-06 13:53:48]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no, I might give you some elite area party buffs
[Mar 10-06 13:54:6]Pharoah %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ taht would work
[Mar 10-06 13:54:12]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ our are a support class

[Mar 10-06 13:54:26]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :P
[Mar 10-06 13:54:40]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, giving area spells means you couldn't have a lot of other stuff
[Mar 10-06 13:55:4]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what would wiz have to give up? :P
[Mar 10-06 13:55:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm, maybe a subclass that has nothing but area spells...
[Mar 10-06 13:55:30]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's called lich ;)
[Mar 10-06 13:55:38]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Mar 10-06 13:56:2]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ in my current system of balance, if you want any class to have something, they have to give up something :P
[Mar 10-06 13:56:14]Pharoah %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ works for me
[Mar 10-06 13:57:0]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i'll give up fighters for a monk area that actuaslly works...
[Mar 10-06 13:57:22]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ cause dispell all is a joke
[Mar 10-06 13:57:54]Pharoah %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ does druid get a healing spell at least??
[Mar 10-06 13:57:58]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and does pharoah actually fit the naming policy?
[Mar 10-06 13:57:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ monks don't seem like much of a mass destruction class to me
[Mar 10-06 13:58:14]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's why i'm giving up fighters nulvect ;)
[Mar 10-06 13:58:24]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no healing spells
[Mar 10-06 13:59:34]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and skunk

[Mar 10-06 13:59:46]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ as long as he is testing the new druid, I don't care :P
[Mar 10-06 13:59:54]Skunk %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ in that case... :P

[Mar 13-06 22:25:26]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and I don't know why...
[Mar 13-06 22:25:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the search path mechanism is kind of screwy

[Mar 13-06 22:27:20]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nope... that wasn;t it
[Mar 13-06 22:27:24]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no
[Mar 13-06 22:27:30]Dru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ good
[Mar 13-06 22:27:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ bah druids should be required to stay neutralish
[Mar 13-06 22:27:50]Dru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that would be such a pain...
[Mar 13-06 22:28:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I do it by choice on several chars, it's easy
[Mar 13-06 22:28:10]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, I have no idea why this isn't working...
[Mar 13-06 22:28:16]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I may have to remake it
[Mar 13-06 22:28:32]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if the spell isn't spitting errors and help won't find it, it's not the spell itself
[Mar 13-06 22:28:50]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, I think it may be too long of a name for the spell...
[Mar 13-06 22:28:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm

[Mar 14-06 1:28:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kataans aren't as strong as people seem to think

[Mar 14-06 1:29:45]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so nul with cons of 60 and int wis of 50 you think i can survive with vortexing rhon forest?
[Mar 14-06 1:30:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe
[Mar 14-06 1:30:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ with full armour, buffer, maxed def, and 100 con I can still take 500 hp damage in one round sometimes
[Mar 14-06 1:30:53]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ holy
[Mar 14-06 1:31:5]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i need to get str up the roof then
[Mar 14-06 1:31:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ mostly from the hunters
[Mar 14-06 1:31:21]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh i take them out first
[Mar 14-06 1:31:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ my dex isn't so good though
[Mar 14-06 1:31:35]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ neither is mine
[Mar 14-06 1:31:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if you plan on using vortex, you'll definitely want more mp though
[Mar 14-06 1:32:5]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh crud :)
[Mar 14-06 1:32:17]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i got skills to do first!
[Mar 14-06 1:32:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ mine uses something like 160 mp per target per cast
[Mar 14-06 1:32:33]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ouch
[Mar 14-06 1:33:47]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ dont see why dab doesnt want to give us a crazy way to heal ourselves with our pike
[Mar 14-06 1:34:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ our warpike special heals us
[Mar 14-06 1:35:19]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i know but i mean like a one rounder impale sort of thing where we impale and heal ourselves for more like absorb
[Mar 14-06 1:37:41]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so i guess i need more than 1200 mp
[Mar 14-06 1:37:45]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ rofl
[Mar 14-06 1:38:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I use about that much per room
[Mar 14-06 1:38:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Mar 14-06 1:38:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ give it a try, yours might use less mp since it would do less damage
[Mar 14-06 1:39:9]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so i will have to always run around with shards back and forth -_-
[Mar 14-06 1:39:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ shards back and forth??
[Mar 14-06 1:39:33]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yah our guild thing for mp
[Mar 14-06 1:39:47]Xakashi %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so gunna run out of room to gain mp and run back in
[Mar 14-06 1:39:57]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah, yes, stones rubbed at all times

[Mar 14-06 17:56:39]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ok, try it now
[Mar 14-06 17:57:57]Daboura %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ looks like stat bonuses weren't meant to effect hp,sp, or mp
[Mar 14-06 20:37:14]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ psst, this_player()->fix_vital_bonus() after adding stat bonuses and again after they wear off
[Mar 14-06 20:37:20]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I did
[Mar 14-06 20:37:24]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ still didn't work
[Mar 14-06 20:37:44]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Mar 14-06 20:38:6]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I assume that stat_bonuses don't get calculated with hp,sp and mp
[Mar 14-06 20:41:29]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I know the bard song that gives con also ups max hp
[Mar 14-06 20:41:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so there's some way
[Mar 14-06 20:41:47]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yes, I'm sure it manualy sets the stat

[Mar 16-06 16:56:16]Dru %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ was that just a teaser?
[Mar 16-06 16:56:22]Aximili %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ gonna exchange resonate for something or just remove it
[Mar 16-06 16:57:22]A shadow %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Ahh, come on guys, I didn't even look at the code for the spells your losing - let alone even become a druid to see it for myself - and I figured out why :P
[Mar 16-06 16:57:30]A shadow %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you're*
[Mar 16-06 16:57:42]Aximili %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ figured out why what
[Mar 16-06 16:58:8]A shadow %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ A few people mysteriously gain and lose spells, and they can't seem to figure out why :)
[Mar 16-06 16:58:24]Aximili %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ...because daboura added them and took them away?
[Mar 16-06 16:59:46]A shadow %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Nah, like, in the middle of playing, without Daboura doing anything, they'll gain a spell or two... then mysteriously lose them... If you figure it out, don't tell us, at least not on a public line
[Mar 16-06 17:4:38]Dru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i think i figured it out, just testing it now
[Mar 16-06 17:6:4]Dru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ AHA!!

[Mar 16-06 17:10:40]Dru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ k, cool
[Mar 16-06 17:14:47]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ If you can stack, say, 2 vinearmours on yourself, then there's probably an issue
[Mar 16-06 17:15:7]Resolution %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ how bout 2 supplications :P
[Mar 16-06 17:15:45]Resolution %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the effects don't wear off properly, and it lets you double stack the effects while having only 1 sup running
[Mar 16-06 17:22:11]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Wow, yeah, supplication is pretty mussed up
[Mar 16-06 17:22:15]A shadow %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ messed*

[Jun 23-06 23:4:17]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is torment stronger or weaker than darkmist, both destroy utterly or is there a diffrence?
[Jun 23-06 23:5:19]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ newer is usually stronger, but the only way to know for sure is to get two largish mobs of the same level and see how many rounds it takes with each spell
[Jun 23-06 23:5:41]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah ok.
[Jun 23-06 23:13:56]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ summon list gives me a list of my summons?

[Jul 7-06 8:13:29]Tsuke %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ mheal isn't really all that useful, replace can be done at the hospital, and paladins have cure.
[Jul 7-06 8:13:59]Kataro %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so the problem is it isnt a big enough minus when losing a limb
[Jul 7-06 8:14:25]%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Kataro also likes having peace.
[Jul 7-06 8:14:37]Tsuke %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ errmm... more that it's really hard to lose a limb.

[Jul 17-06 0:28:33]Crowley %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the stats don't seem to be in proportion...
[Jul 17-06 0:28:41]Crowley %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ to how they are actually working out.
[Jul 17-06 0:29:25]Crowley %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ in particular con, seems to be alot more expensive then what i would have thought looking at the help file.
[Jul 17-06 0:29:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ keep in mind each class gets a bonus in 3 stats, which lowers the costs of those stats a lot
[Jul 17-06 0:30:29]Crowley %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ must be an aweful lot...
[Jul 17-06 0:30:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ str is one of the clergy stats and con is not, that's why you're seeing such a big different... but I assure you ogres have good con
[Jul 17-06 1:24:30]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :/
[Jul 17-06 1:24:38]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm??
[Jul 17-06 1:25:12]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that new spell was cleric only?
[Jul 17-06 1:25:26]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yep
[Jul 17-06 1:25:50]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so... the cleric question that everyone keeps asking :P will we ever be made useful at higher levels? :P
[Jul 17-06 1:26:8]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that new spell is nice.
[Jul 17-06 1:26:12]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that spell not proving useful??
[Jul 17-06 1:26:42]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yay... another supporting spell...
[Jul 17-06 1:26:56]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thats what clerics do?
[Jul 17-06 1:26:58]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ clerics are healers, if you're expecting to get more damage spells you will be sad
[Jul 17-06 1:27:14]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ unfortunatly i can't quite make that sound like its dripping with sarcassam in text.
[Jul 17-06 1:27:18]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ wich is why i like kataan
[Jul 17-06 1:27:34]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I do have a number of spell ideas already for them which should prove useful though
[Jul 17-06 1:27:52]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and that is why high level clerics simply don't exist.
[Jul 17-06 1:27:54]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ anything for kataans?
[Jul 17-06 1:28:12]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what do you think clerics should have, tsuke??
[Jul 17-06 1:28:20]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ everyone keeps them as a supporting class. and once they hit the higher levels, there is no-one to support.
[Jul 17-06 1:28:20]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you seem to be the highest around
[Jul 17-06 1:29:38]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ my idea is already sitting on the cleric board. no-one except vennenum was really interested in even extrapolating further/more workable ideas from it.
[Jul 17-06 1:29:46]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the aura thing??
[Jul 17-06 1:29:52]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ aye
[Jul 17-06 1:30:0]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Jul 17-06 1:30:4]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ whats the idea?
[Jul 17-06 1:30:6]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I'll re-read it
[Jul 17-06 1:30:54]Xiaoz %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ awh crap its late and i have to go to the docs tomorow. later.
[Jul 17-06 1:31:0]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ night
[Jul 17-06 1:31:8]Tsuke %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but yeah. the only reason i can xp at all is because of hf, else it'd be so slow and just not worth it. i pitty non-angel clerics once they hit elite.
[Jul 17-06 1:43:5]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well tsuke
[Jul 17-06 1:43:19]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I already have a spell coded that slowly heals you, though not for that long
[Jul 17-06 1:43:47]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ as for damage, I'll be looking over the numbers when I get to clerics
[Jul 17-06 1:46:11]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I really don't want clerics to become major damage dealers, but I'll be sure they can do decently on their own and give them some better support spells
[Jul 17-06 22:35:50]Kusan %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is there any special things about monks?
[Jul 17-06 22:47:1]Kusan %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hello yang.

[Jul 20-06 18:44:39]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ they have not been changed yet
[Jul 20-06 18:44:49]Yeng %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ooo what they gonna do?
[Jul 20-06 18:44:55]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not sure
[Jul 20-06 18:45:1]Yeng %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ okie
[Jul 21-06 22:49:30]Xiaoz %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nulvect have you decidedto change the kataans?
[Jul 21-06 22:51:44]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no, haven't decided anything like that yet
[Jul 21-06 22:51:56]Xiaoz %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod.
[Jul 22-06 23:14:3]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you awake nul?
[Jul 22-06 23:15:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ sort of
[Jul 22-06 23:16:17]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what do you need
[Jul 22-06 23:16:29]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ with your ideas for the balance of the kataans was your idea to have spells that would weaken/para/slow a mob down then we attack with a demonic type spell?
[Jul 22-06 23:17:9]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if i can pry that is :P
[Jul 22-06 23:18:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ my basic idea was to make demonic summoning spells that summon demon spirits that cause various negative effects to everything in the room
[Jul 22-06 23:18:49]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nodnod would that make everything attack the caster though?
[Jul 22-06 23:18:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not sure
[Jul 22-06 23:19:11]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ cause if we lost he area attack that'd kinda suck having to take out one at a shot
[Jul 22-06 23:19:15]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the*
[Jul 22-06 23:19:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the prototypes I made a while back didn't make them attack you
[Jul 22-06 23:19:47]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nice
[Jul 22-06 23:19:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but we'll see, I might not even go that route
[Jul 22-06 23:19:55]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nodnodnod
[Jul 22-06 23:21:3]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i think it'd be kinda neat to have a change seeing as most casting type classes all have an area attack spell
[Jul 22-06 23:27:44]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ right now, fighters have one area attack, pyros have two, sorcs have one, necros have one, kataans have two, and clerics/paladins sort of have one
[Jul 23-06 13:41:39]Ploo %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hrm
[Jul 23-06 13:45:18]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I agree
[Jul 23-06 13:45:39]Ikko %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ?
[Jul 23-06 13:48:50]Ploo %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just thought I'd add something on this line :P
[Jul 23-06 19:46:55]Kusan %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ now to find out if i can boost
[Jul 23-06 23:36:51]Xiaoz %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if you change kataans, will the entire hall and description of the class change as well?
[Jul 23-06 23:37:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the basic concept for them is not going to change
[Jul 23-06 23:37:55]Xiaoz %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but they will be more physical then spell based?
[Jul 23-06 23:38:11]Xiaoz %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like spear attacks with spells as buffs and such?
[Jul 23-06 23:38:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yes, they will definitely gain more physical attacks
[Jul 24-06 15:46:5]Yang %^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is there gona be any changes to minks?
[Jul 26-06 20:45:10]Jhul %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Bo

[Jul 27-06 3:17:12]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you should check north of tirun me thinks
[Jul 27-06 3:18:2]A shadow %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ directly north of the gate or there about I believe....
[Jul 28-06 18:49:18]Zalen %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ anyone know anything bout kataans?
[Jul 28-06 18:49:28]Tsfaru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like?
[Jul 28-06 18:49:36]Zalen %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what skills they should train?
[Jul 28-06 18:50:36]Tsfaru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ umm, all the magic stuff, I wouldnt train magic defense or conjuring though
[Jul 28-06 18:51:0]Zalen %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what weapon skill would dakzhul do under?
[Jul 28-06 18:51:32]Tsfaru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I think its flail, but dont hold me to it

[Jul 28-06 18:54:18]Tsfaru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ From what I was told Kataans suck until elite. Friend said Vortex was great though
[Jul 28-06 18:54:34]Zalen %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thats why i went kataan
[Jul 28-06 18:55:0]Tsfaru %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ then your cool then

[Jul 31-06 20:1:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ glad you like it
[Jul 31-06 20:1:16]Yeng %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ who coded that one JNul?
[Jul 31-06 20:1:24]Yeng %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Nul*
[Jul 31-06 20:2:4]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Sup nul :)
[Jul 31-06 20:2:20]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I did
[Jul 31-06 20:2:26]Yeng %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ woot
[Jul 31-06 20:2:48]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ You have a post on the kataan board Nul :P :)
[Jul 31-06 20:3:44]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you don't want to have a spell that cuts the strength of everything in the room by half instantly jareth??
[Jul 31-06 20:3:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ (just as an example)
[Jul 31-06 20:4:18]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Hmmm.
[Jul 31-06 20:4:48]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I dunno :( Not really cause everything would attack and if kataans are being changed to not have vortex then it would kinda suck to have a lot of things attacking you at once.
[Jul 31-06 20:6:10]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ don't get me wrong, it seems cool and all
[Jul 31-06 20:6:40]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it just also seems like it'd be annoying too. Cause I've played a druid before and it was annoying keeping up with buffs, muchless debuffing everything room after room
[Jul 31-06 20:6:50]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the prototypes I have coded up do not cause the room to attack you
[Jul 31-06 20:7:10]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Alright, it seems a bit better already :P :)
[Jul 31-06 20:7:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Jul 31-06 20:7:44]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I was one of maybe 5 people who played wizards to decent levels after dab changed them, so I'm very aware of the intricacies of debuffs vs exp per round
[Jul 31-06 20:8:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ should I coalesce this mob or just take more damage?? etc
[Jul 31-06 20:8:20]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ *nods*
[Jul 31-06 20:9:30]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the problem is that debuffs are inherently weaker than buffs, because a buff typically lasts through several kills, but every kill you have to use a round to debuff again...
[Jul 31-06 20:10:34]Jareth %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm, just saying. It'd probably get a little bit annoying to do room after room. Also, the idea about making them a bit more strengthy is cool, but kinda odd considering people, or maybe not everyone, maybe just me, is used to kataans being more magic. more about intell and wis.

[Jul 31-06 20:14:20]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, I don't think it would be so bad to cast a spell once per room, especially if it means you take half the damage, or kill twice as fast, or something

[Aug 30-06 12:49:0]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ can u fix it?
[Aug 30-06 12:49:22]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no
[Aug 30-06 12:50:6]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, maybe it'll still wear off right.. looks like it will
[Aug 30-06 12:50:12]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Aug 30-06 12:50:40]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just bearsrage and felinefury are what I touched
[Aug 30-06 12:50:44]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah
[Aug 30-06 12:51:20]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ may i ask what you did? :p
[Aug 30-06 12:51:48]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just reloaded them, which means they lost track of who had cast them
[Aug 30-06 12:51:58]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh
[Aug 30-06 12:52:24]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ they'll be under faith instead of defense when I get through all this stuff
[Aug 30-06 12:52:58]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so they will just be under ur faith when u type spells?
[Aug 30-06 12:53:28]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah, just changing the category, not changing the spells themselves
[Aug 30-06 12:53:36]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kk
[Aug 30-06 12:54:10]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ for a second there i was thinkin you were gonna change them to faith based :P
[Aug 30-06 12:54:20]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ instead of nature
[Aug 30-06 12:54:56]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah, no not changing how they are now
[Aug 30-06 12:55:2]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Aug 30-06 12:55:4]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ they're just not defense spells
[Aug 30-06 12:55:8]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yea
[Aug 30-06 13:0:22]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yea they still wear off
[Aug 30-06 13:0:38]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah, good, thanks for letting me know
[Aug 30-06 13:0:48]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no problem
[Aug 30-06 13:12:7]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ok, spell change happening real quick
[Aug 30-06 13:12:13]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :o
[Aug 30-06 13:12:35]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ fortitude has been renamed to bisonsmight
[Aug 30-06 13:12:41]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ k
[Aug 30-06 13:13:7]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that is all
[Aug 30-06 17:58:36]Aidan %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Supplication eventually lasts more than 30s, right?
[Aug 30-06 19:49:47]Jhul %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ What is my main spell, I havnt played in awhile? :P
[Aug 30-06 19:50:7]Jhul %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kataannnnn
[Aug 31-06 1:24:22]Uzamaki %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Is fortitude gone gone?
[Aug 31-06 1:24:30]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ its bisonsmight
[Aug 31-06 1:24:42]Uzamaki %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is it a different skill amount?
[Aug 31-06 1:24:48]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nope
[Aug 31-06 1:24:50]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just renamed
[Aug 31-06 1:24:58]Uzamaki %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hrm
[Aug 31-06 1:25:36]Uzamaki %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thanks. :)
[Aug 31-06 1:25:40]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Aug 31-06 1:34:8]Uzamaki %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Oh! It shows in other now, not defense.
[Aug 31-06 1:34:16]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Aug 31-06 1:34:24]Uzamaki %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that was confrusing. :)
[Aug 31-06 1:34:40]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hes movin all the buffs to other
[Aug 31-06 1:34:56]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh wait
[Aug 31-06 1:35:0]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no hes movin em to faith
[Aug 31-06 1:35:14]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ dunno why that ones in other
[Aug 31-06 1:35:34]%^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Uzamaki wants an attack that targets flying foes...I'd call it 'snakesonaplane'
[Aug 31-06 1:35:42]Zub %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ haha
[Sep 7-06 1:52:40]Ghan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yo nul
[Sep 7-06 1:52:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hey
[Sep 7-06 1:53:6]Ghan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ would it be possible to add something in so i can see when vigor wears off?
[Sep 7-06 1:53:40]Ghan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ cause endy yells cause i cant tell when it does
[Sep 7-06 1:54:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ possible yes, but will I do it, probably not
[Sep 7-06 1:54:32]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's a granting of something to someone else, that person knows when it goes away
[Sep 7-06 1:54:48]Ghan %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ok
[Sep 7-06 1:55:36]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ plus it doesn't have any actual visible effect that you could see
[Sep 7-06 1:55:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ most of your long-term spells you'll know, though
[Sep 7-06 9:8:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm, I was always told supplication was great the way it was
[Sep 7-06 9:8:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ never got into monks much myself
[Sep 7-06 9:8:24]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ can i be honest
[Sep 7-06 9:8:32]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's not useful at all really
[Sep 7-06 9:8:36]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ 1 stat per 20
[Sep 7-06 9:8:44]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ even with 100 str
[Sep 7-06 9:8:52]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ 5 str doesnt really do anything
[Sep 7-06 9:8:59]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Sep 7-06 9:9:7]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but i do think an increase would require a penalty
[Sep 7-06 9:9:15]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ie sacrifice dex for str
[Sep 7-06 9:9:21]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ def for attack
[Sep 7-06 9:9:31]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ sorry about the cuss on newbie btw
[Sep 7-06 9:9:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ don't necessarily need a penalty
[Sep 7-06 9:9:37]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kinda slipped out
[Sep 7-06 9:9:47]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod, i'd be fine with or without one
[Sep 7-06 9:9:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh, it's 6 am, I don't really care
[Sep 7-06 9:10:5]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just dont wanna sound like i'm begging to be stronger, cuz monks are good
[Sep 7-06 9:10:27]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and it doesnt add any melee skill
[Sep 7-06 9:10:47]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I'll look into it when I get to monks
[Sep 7-06 9:10:49]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ obviously it was meant not too, but seems like it should to me
[Sep 7-06 9:10:53]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ sounds good
[Sep 7-06 9:11:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it can't add too much, since it adds so many separate things right now
[Sep 7-06 9:11:11]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Sep 7-06 9:11:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but I understand that too little means it's not worth casting
[Sep 7-06 9:11:35]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yea luckily monks have a good variety of useful attacks
[Sep 7-06 9:12:9]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and ironskin i've never used, only cuz it lasts only like 30 seconds
[Sep 7-06 9:12:21]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not worth the round it takes too cast imo :P
[Sep 7-06 9:12:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's 15 rounds of protection
[Sep 7-06 9:13:13]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ with one round wasted on that, every like 15 monsters you lose like 25k
[Sep 7-06 9:13:21]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ doesnt add much defense at all
[Sep 7-06 9:13:31]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and most mobs dont hurt to much
[Sep 7-06 9:13:37]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ monks have abnormally high def anyways
[Sep 7-06 9:13:53]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i've always felt my underequipped monks have better def than fully equipped fighters
[Sep 7-06 9:15:1]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh well you can read that too :P
[Sep 7-06 9:15:29]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ your darksoul line on?
[Sep 7-06 9:15:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I tend to keep guild lines off
[Sep 7-06 9:15:53]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah i said we probably shouldnt have scry either but i'm not complaining
[Sep 7-06 9:16:23]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and thats only because i honestly feel monks have an advantage over every class pk wise, scry makes it a million times easier now that scry rooms are gone
[Sep 7-06 9:16:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I've thought about giving clergy a lesser scry actually... just give the area name, or a one-liner room desc, instead of the whole room...
[Sep 7-06 9:16:57]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Sep 7-06 9:17:3]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that would be a good idea
[Sep 7-06 9:18:5]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you could probably get rid of either paintouch or openpalm too, never used those
[Sep 7-06 9:18:29]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ dont think anyone will ever play a monk just for thier magic
[Sep 7-06 9:18:47]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ unless they got 5 magic attack
[Sep 7-06 9:19:11]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but that would prolly be unfair
[Sep 7-06 9:19:46]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ by the way, it looks to me like you need to train some skills
[Sep 7-06 9:20:7]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well agent and logaine were both really strong monks
[Sep 7-06 9:20:11]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ this isnt my first
[Sep 7-06 9:20:31]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but 3 magic attack compared to 6 melee
[Sep 7-06 9:20:47]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yep.. melee is what they do
[Sep 7-06 9:20:55]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Sep 7-06 9:21:21]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i'd take the melee over magic any day of the week
[Sep 7-06 9:22:31]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and i know you're already working on them and have your own thing goin, but i think songs should only need to be sung once and they constantly go until you stop it
[Sep 7-06 9:22:37]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and dances
[Sep 7-06 9:22:45]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and you should be able to sing and dance while you fight
[Sep 7-06 9:22:51]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that would be pimp
[Sep 7-06 9:22:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ uh, songs have lyrics, you want them to just loop forever??
[Sep 7-06 9:23:7]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you can sing and do most dances while fighting
[Sep 7-06 9:23:19]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ dont really need lyrics
[Sep 7-06 9:23:25]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you could be inventive and get around it
[Sep 7-06 9:23:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ gets pretty generic after a while
[Sep 7-06 9:23:49]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ya
[Sep 7-06 9:23:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I've been trying to do that with dances, there are only so many ways to describe them
[Sep 7-06 9:23:57]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i'd just omit it from my client :P
[Sep 7-06 9:24:5]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yea thats a tough one to tackle
[Sep 7-06 9:24:23]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ generic messages are the way to go
[Sep 7-06 9:24:51]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ xxxx starts the dance of the b lahblah --xxx continues his dance of the blah blah every 45 seconds or so
[Sep 7-06 9:25:13]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or xxx dances into the room
[Sep 7-06 9:25:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, if that's how it worked, the dances that create an effect would have to be used continuously
[Sep 7-06 9:25:25]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ xxx is standing here performing
[Sep 7-06 9:25:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so you couldn't use the attacks or any other dance
[Sep 7-06 9:25:45]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i think they should be mostly skill and stat boosts
[Sep 7-06 9:26:9]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or be really pimp and have some of them open up special abilities from other classes
[Sep 7-06 9:26:21]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like a song that gives them warblade, or stab or a spell
[Sep 7-06 9:26:25]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's not possible with the way things are set up currently
[Sep 7-06 9:26:29]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah
[Sep 7-06 9:26:39]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ multi-classing wouldbe pimp heh
[Sep 7-06 9:26:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not on pd.. not with our classes
[Sep 7-06 9:27:3]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ even if you couldnt combine, just be able to switch
[Sep 7-06 9:27:11]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like a remort but your old char isnt lost
[Sep 7-06 9:27:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's in the works
[Sep 7-06 9:27:21]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh no kiddin :P
[Sep 7-06 9:27:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ whit's project, yeah
[Sep 7-06 9:27:29]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thats cool
[Sep 7-06 9:27:51]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i thought i remembered my brother sayin somethin about it but i guess i just thought it was an idea he had or somethin
[Sep 7-06 9:27:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ few bugs in it still and it doesn't deal with quest races/classes yet, but it looks mostly done to me
[Sep 7-06 9:28:1]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm cool
[Sep 7-06 9:28:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the command was enabled by accident in fact and a couple people used it
[Sep 7-06 9:28:31]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah mess things up?
[Sep 7-06 9:28:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ only to find their skills and stats didn't get restored when they went back
[Sep 7-06 9:28:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Sep 7-06 9:28:45]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ burn
[Sep 7-06 9:28:53]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i'da been pissed :P
[Sep 7-06 9:28:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so I disabled it
[Sep 7-06 9:29:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ they were both lower level
[Sep 7-06 9:29:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and I believe it saved their info, just didn't restore it correctly
[Sep 7-06 9:29:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so it's still there
[Sep 7-06 9:29:39]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh hope for them
[Sep 7-06 9:30:17]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh big one too
[Sep 7-06 9:30:27]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ demons should be able to be monks without losing thier spells
[Sep 7-06 9:30:37]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ definetly
[Sep 7-06 9:30:57]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i had a demon monk even tho i knew i was gonna lose stuff hehe
[Sep 7-06 9:31:15]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ wasnt too bad, but you lose supplication and some other things
[Sep 7-06 9:31:25]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ gore was nice tho
[Sep 7-06 9:32:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ demons are evil, monks are good
[Sep 7-06 9:32:45]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's that simple
[Sep 7-06 9:32:53]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ there's evil monks
[Sep 7-06 9:32:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not on pd
[Sep 7-06 9:33:21]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ help supplication
[Sep 7-06 9:33:25]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thier chosen deity hehe
[Sep 7-06 9:33:35]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nothing's going to stop you from kicking and hitting things, but if you expect a benevolent diety to assist a satanic demon...
[Sep 7-06 9:33:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's a remnant of the old pd
[Sep 7-06 9:33:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ where there were light and dark monks
[Sep 7-06 9:33:53]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah
[Sep 7-06 9:34:15]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i just think evil monks would be cool ;)
[Sep 7-06 9:34:39]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and eagle claw should be changed to the five point palm exploding heart technique :P
[Sep 7-06 9:34:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I have some ideas for another evil clergy sub actually
[Sep 7-06 9:34:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Sep 7-06 9:35:9]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ either that or a ripping the heart out of the chest kinda thing

[Sep 7-06 9:36:35]Dubbya %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that would be awesome
[Sep 7-06 9:36:47]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Thinking of implementing more subs?
[Sep 7-06 9:36:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not any time soon

[Sep 26-06 23:10:19]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ even then...
[Sep 26-06 23:10:21]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yah

[Sep 27-06 18:41:32]Geddoe %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well since conjuring is expensive at such a low number i didnt figure it would matter much
[Sep 27-06 18:41:50]Geddoe %^WHITE%^BOLD%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ its only 35 and 100k only raised it 3 points

[Oct 3-06 2:2:50]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no
[Oct 3-06 2:3:0]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i figured it was elite spell
[Oct 3-06 2:3:8]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that would be something different then
[Oct 3-06 2:3:24]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i meant as to what it does
[Oct 3-06 2:3:42]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not much anything you can do with that spell
[Oct 3-06 2:3:47]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I recoded the whole thing from scratch
[Oct 3-06 2:4:6]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ does it do anything different from before?
[Oct 3-06 2:4:32]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ let's just say that I try to make everything useful, and I didn't think the old one was very useful
[Oct 3-06 2:4:42]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i cant think of any way it can be useful
[Oct 3-06 2:4:54]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ without it being cheap
[Oct 3-06 2:6:42]Riccard %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ What does Peace do? I know 'it brings peace to the area' but um... what exactly does that mean?
[Oct 3-06 2:6:50]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ stops combat
[Oct 3-06 2:7:4]Riccard %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Ah, awesome. Rather handy then :)
[Oct 3-06 2:7:56]Riccard %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Oh, one more question. Are they any sort of claw or knuckle duster weapons for monks that anyone knows of?
[Oct 3-06 2:8:33]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ there are not
[Oct 3-06 2:8:39]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not anymore

[Oct 3-06 2:8:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's not even possible to do it the way normal weapons are done
[Oct 3-06 2:9:9]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ we used to have some
[Oct 3-06 2:9:13]Riccard %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Fair enough. *nods*

[Oct 3-06 2:9:31]Algren %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ only thing I could think of, is if a pair of gloves added melee skills
[Oct 3-06 2:9:49]Riccard %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Yeah, that'd be cool, Algren.
[Oct 3-06 2:9:59]Algren %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ sub_class specific
[Oct 3-06 2:10:7]Algren %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Like the warblade for swashs

[Oct 3-06 20:23:4]Geddoe %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ conjuring is much....much cheaper than assassin agil
[Oct 3-06 20:23:12]Lina %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod my rogue spent like 40m yesterday on agil :P
[Oct 3-06 20:23:14]Geddoe %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ now if you mean thug agil, then conjuring is way way harder

[Oct 5-06 12:17:49]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ was it harder than with other classes??
[Oct 5-06 12:17:55]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ a bit, but its expected
[Oct 5-06 12:18:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm... what spell was most useful for that??
[Oct 5-06 12:18:23]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i like unknit and wound alot, but they lower align
[Oct 5-06 12:18:23]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Nulvect likes to get player opinions :P
[Oct 5-06 12:18:31]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so i used dispell mainly
[Oct 5-06 12:18:41]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah
[Oct 5-06 12:19:7]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i like when admins ask for opinions :P

[Oct 5-06 12:19:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ find anything you should be able to turn, but can't??
[Oct 5-06 12:19:37]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ actually, haven't tried using it yet
[Oct 5-06 12:19:55]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ when i get my stats rounded off imma go test everything for fun :D
[Oct 5-06 12:20:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ alrighty
[Oct 5-06 12:23:19]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i was thinking it'd be cool if evil clerics worked, calling on their powers from not so righteous gods so we could still boost, but i understand thats already been talked about and decided upon :P
[Oct 5-06 12:23:51]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I've made sure that it's _possible_ to function as an evil cleric
[Oct 5-06 12:23:59]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I don't think it would be very fun though
[Oct 5-06 12:24:1]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nodnod
[Oct 5-06 12:24:9]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it'd be more solitary, then support
[Oct 5-06 12:24:45]Wintersun %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ still gotta try to see if paralyze works when i'm evil, if so then i might consider being an evil smiter :P
[Oct 5-06 18:32:20]Wintersun %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ goin evil now :P
[Oct 5-06 18:32:34]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you probably won't enjoy it :P
[Oct 5-06 18:32:44]Wintersun %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i figure maybe i'll solo evil
[Oct 5-06 18:32:52]Wintersun %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ since unknit is nice :P
[Oct 5-06 18:33:18]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ how do you like the wards??
[Oct 5-06 18:33:28]Wintersun %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ didn't up conjuring yet :p

[Oct 21-06 0:59:48]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ true
[Oct 21-06 1:0:2]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I para kazuma for about 3 turns
[Oct 21-06 1:0:14]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ right off the bad? or do you gotta damage him first?
[Oct 21-06 1:0:24]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ right off
[Oct 21-06 1:0:28]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i noticed that i have to hurt mobs a bit to get it to kick in
[Oct 21-06 1:0:34]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or they just run
[Oct 21-06 1:0:48]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ My stats are decent though

[Oct 21-06 1:1:52]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Ima wish I was lvl 19 lol
[Oct 21-06 1:2:6]Kazuma %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ lol, yeah, pissing spade off prolly wasn't one of your best ideas.
[Oct 21-06 1:2:20]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ He started it
[Oct 21-06 1:2:24]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ lol
[Oct 21-06 1:2:32]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ in past events
[Oct 21-06 1:2:40]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i've learned that it only matters who finishes it :P
[Oct 21-06 1:3:0]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ When Nul is done ill work on it
[Oct 21-06 1:3:10]Zub %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hrm
[Oct 21-06 1:3:10]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but right now I dont do much damage
[Oct 21-06 1:4:22]Zub %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ did i just hear encouragement rohl :o
[Oct 21-06 1:4:30]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I dunno if drain is that great, dunno if it takes enough away
[Oct 21-06 1:4:40]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ only if you heard wrong :P
[Oct 21-06 1:5:2]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ there is, at the moment, a rather large gap between damage abilities... but it'll be fixed
[Oct 21-06 1:5:4]Zub %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ shrug
[Oct 21-06 1:5:4]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ dont forget where my heart lies :P
[Oct 21-06 1:5:12]Zub %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yea
[Oct 21-06 1:8:16]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ gore is my best move lol
[Oct 21-06 1:8:42]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hellfire?
[Oct 21-06 1:8:52]Nekor %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hellfire sucks
[Oct 21-06 1:8:54]Zub %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hellfire sucks
[Oct 21-06 1:8:58]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ gore does more
[Oct 21-06 1:9:8]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hellfire was changed
[Oct 21-06 1:9:10]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i used hellfire on my gremlin kataan
[Oct 21-06 1:9:20]Zub %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it use to be alright
[Oct 21-06 1:9:20]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ its still not great
[Oct 21-06 1:9:40]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ as long as i can make it good with stats
[Oct 21-06 1:9:42]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :P
[Oct 21-06 1:10:2]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I 2turn sewers with hellfire
[Oct 21-06 21:57:3]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ good enough to exp with, thantos??
[Oct 21-06 21:57:27]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hellfire was tweaked in a couple ways
[Oct 21-06 21:58:37]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ since hellfire has always said it attacks everything and didn't actually hit party members, I'll just tell you, since it could be confusing: hellfire will hit party members
[Oct 21-06 21:58:49]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ interesting
[Oct 21-06 21:58:57]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well i usually go solo anyways
[Oct 21-06 21:59:5]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that warranted making it a little stronger
[Oct 21-06 21:59:17]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i notice help demonfire still exsists....that means it will be with me later eh?
[Oct 21-06 21:59:43]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's a completely new spell
[Oct 21-06 21:59:47]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah
[Oct 21-06 22:2:43]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ we're essentially battlemages right
[Oct 21-06 22:2:57]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not really
[Oct 21-06 22:3:7]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ battle cleric!
[Oct 21-06 22:4:51]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kataans are a combination of spear-fighters and dark priests with a bit of roguishness
[Oct 21-06 22:5:3]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh
[Oct 21-06 22:6:11]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I can say right now that I don't think there will be anymore attack spells...
[Oct 21-06 22:6:29]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ alright...but dakzhul still exsists
[Oct 21-06 22:6:35]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it sure does
[Oct 21-06 22:6:47]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ rewrote it from scratch
[Oct 21-06 22:6:51]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is there a next in line to daklihn as well?
[Oct 21-06 22:7:7]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what do you mean, a next in line to it??
[Oct 21-06 22:7:25]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well bloodlance is to dakzhul...as daklihn is to ???
[Oct 21-06 22:7:41]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like theres initiation attacks and melee attacks during combat
[Oct 21-06 22:7:53]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ bloodlance isn't meant to be in any kind of grouping
[Oct 21-06 22:8:7]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well it starts combat...does dakzhul no longer initiate?
[Oct 21-06 22:8:25]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ read the first sentence in help dakzhul
[Oct 21-06 22:8:31]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ opening attack
[Oct 21-06 22:8:47]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is it so odd to have two opening attacks??
[Oct 21-06 22:8:55]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nope
[Oct 21-06 22:9:11]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ im just saying im gonna guess dakzhul is more powerful then bloodlance
[Oct 21-06 22:9:41]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ they're not really comparable, they're for different things
[Oct 21-06 22:9:51]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah one heals...and one deals...right?
[Oct 21-06 22:10:1]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ something like that
[Oct 21-06 22:10:9]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i guess i'll just find out
[Oct 21-06 22:11:37]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ one more tho....the kataan warpike....is there another kataan based weapon that kinda goes together with my attack
[Oct 21-06 22:12:13]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not to my knowledge
[Oct 21-06 22:12:23]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is that a good idea lol? :D
[Oct 21-06 22:12:31]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but look around, you never know
[Oct 21-06 22:12:35]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah true
[Oct 21-06 22:13:1]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ good work tho...i dont mind these new spells, still gotta get used to it tho
[Oct 21-06 22:13:13]Thantos %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh and hellfire makes me happy haha
[Oct 22-06 1:17:27]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ anything new coming tonight Nul? Lol
[Oct 22-06 1:17:41]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ probably not, getting my list of stuff together
[Oct 22-06 1:17:55]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ still going to have area debuffs?
[Oct 22-06 1:18:38]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ So far I like what you've done, im just not sure about the damage ;p But ill work some things up just in case.
[Oct 22-06 1:19:56]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I think the damage is fine really, I keep testing it
[Oct 22-06 1:20:24]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Is dakzhul now elite? or is it just gone?
[Oct 22-06 1:20:44]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ when I take things out, there's no help file left
[Oct 22-06 1:21:14]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kk, thanks.
[Oct 22-06 1:28:44]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ was Hellfire's mana cost raised?
[Oct 22-06 12:25:53]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so you kataans a little more inspired now?? ;P
[Oct 22-06 12:26:11]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ after getting a 1k dakzhul...yeah
[Oct 22-06 12:26:37]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, I was set a bit higher than you
[Oct 22-06 12:26:59]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I know your dex was higher if you hit rohl lol
[Oct 22-06 12:27:39]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I still have room for an abil/spell or two... so if you guys have any ideas just let me know... no more attack spells though
[Oct 22-06 12:27:43]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ How high are you set? Unbelievable amount? or just high lol
[Oct 22-06 12:27:53]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nah not super high
[Oct 22-06 12:28:5]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ any debuffs comming in soon?
[Oct 22-06 12:28:7]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i think i'd like to see some kinda buffer
[Oct 22-06 12:28:47]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe something tonight, but don't count on it
[Oct 22-06 12:29:23]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or maybe like a kinda tank summon that'll take hits but not hit back
[Oct 22-06 12:32:29]Joker %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ can you do an abil right after dakzhul hits? like charge/slash?
[Oct 22-06 22:17:24]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what lvl are you rohl?

[Oct 22-06 22:19:38]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ 50 i'm guessing
[Oct 22-06 22:20:10]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you get bloodlance before 34
[Oct 22-06 22:20:18]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ probably 30
[Oct 22-06 22:20:20]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ 5 levels
[Oct 22-06 22:20:30]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i should have just gotten the levels when i had hellfire
[Oct 22-06 22:20:34]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ its mainly dex that raises its dmg

[Oct 22-06 22:37:30]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is what you need
[Oct 22-06 22:43:42]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nul i got scared today :O
[Oct 22-06 22:46:28]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ about what??
[Oct 22-06 22:46:48]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i lost hellfire and was afraid i'd have to level to 30 using shadowburst
[Oct 22-06 22:46:56]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ then i decided eh i'll max summoning :P
[Oct 22-06 22:47:24]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ now i'm happy :P
[Oct 22-06 22:47:26]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah, yeah, about 95% of everything I touch will require skills to learn it rather than just gaining at with a level
[Oct 22-06 22:47:28]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i was upset :P
[Oct 22-06 22:47:34]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod thats how it should be
[Oct 23-06 0:26:35]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nul, i've got this feeling that i'm going to be playing kataan alot more than i expected :O
[Oct 23-06 0:26:51]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i'm always torn over choosing a fighting class, or a magic class
[Oct 23-06 0:26:57]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ now i've got both all in one
[Oct 23-06 0:27:7]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ in a sense
[Oct 23-06 0:27:21]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ glad you think that
[Oct 23-06 0:27:25]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's sort of what I'm going for
[Oct 23-06 0:28:5]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ its unique, in comparison with the other classes
[Oct 23-06 0:28:13]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ monk is probably the closest to it
[Oct 23-06 0:30:3]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ do you have any magic defense spells in mind? or are ya just gonna go with buffer?
[Oct 23-06 0:31:1]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, I thought about one more defense thing, but I'm not sure
[Oct 23-06 0:31:9]%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Rohl nods
[Oct 23-06 0:31:13]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe I'll just give you parry, polearms are good for that
[Oct 23-06 0:31:31]%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Rohl nods
[Oct 23-06 0:31:53]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i dont mind buffer but the one thing that bugs me about it is the duration of it
[Oct 23-06 0:32:7]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kataans aren't really defense oriented
[Oct 23-06 0:32:19]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the best defense is to kill your opponent before he can hurt you
[Oct 23-06 0:32:25]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod:P
[Oct 23-06 0:32:33]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thats what i'm used to
[Oct 23-06 0:32:47]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ they definitely aren't bad though, there are some tricks
[Oct 23-06 0:33:1]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but i noticed on mage characters and cleric and stuff, buffer didn't last very long
[Oct 23-06 0:33:27]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i prefer a good offense over a decent offense and a decent defense
[Oct 23-06 0:33:37]Nulvect %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Oct 23-06 0:34:27]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ another cool thing is, imma have more main stats
[Oct 23-06 0:34:39]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so i wont feel bad about raising str/dex :P
[Oct 23-06 2:3:34]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ imagine if at elite fear para'd all mobs like dragons breath :P
[Oct 23-06 2:3:44]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that'd be too good tho
[Oct 23-06 2:3:56]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Mine para's 2-3turns
[Oct 23-06 2:4:4]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ never tested mine
[Oct 23-06 2:4:26]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I cant hit Ard with daklihn...
[Oct 23-06 2:4:46]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I had to use bloodlance then hellfire
[Oct 23-06 2:5:6]Joker %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I love kataan cause its the most unique to me

[Oct 23-06 2:14:12]Joker %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kataan is versatile
[Oct 23-06 2:14:14]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ its a hard choice, probably thug though since i was the buffest of all time :O

[Oct 25-06 3:40:50]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you kataans have any suggestions based on how things are working for you right now??
[Oct 25-06 3:42:46]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i think its goin great
[Oct 25-06 3:43:54]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ok...
[Oct 25-06 3:44:38]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i'm thinkin about leveling up to 30 now
[Oct 25-06 3:45:20]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ might be fun
[Oct 25-06 3:45:26]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nods
[Oct 25-06 23:7:15]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ almost max skills at 30 :O
[Oct 25-06 23:19:59]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is vortex staying?
[Oct 25-06 23:21:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yep
[Oct 25-06 23:21:37]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ awesome
[Oct 25-06 23:21:49]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ damien is trying to make me go to 50 :(
[Oct 26-06 0:59:30]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ this is how i think all spells should be. raising int/wis i've been watching hellfire progress slightly, no its not much but its all i care about
[Oct 26-06 2:37:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ looks like kataans are pretty popular now :P
[Oct 26-06 2:37:35]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :P
[Oct 26-06 2:37:59]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nul kataan is prob gonna be my favorite class
[Oct 26-06 2:38:41]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i been xping like mad :P
[Oct 26-06 2:39:31]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I hope I don't make them _too_ awesome and then nobody wants to play anything else
[Oct 26-06 2:39:47]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well your redoing them now, thats whats attracting them :P
[Oct 26-06 2:40:3]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah, just noticed some more balancing that needs to go on, too
[Oct 26-06 2:40:19]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ when you move onto necro there'll probably be abuncha necros :P
[Oct 26-06 2:41:35]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hellfire was cool when it hit all the mobs no matter your mp, taking you into -mps, but yea i think that was a necessary fix
[Oct 26-06 2:41:47]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well not no matter your mp, just so long as you had 150
[Oct 26-06 2:42:47]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ didn't know it did that ever
[Oct 31-06 22:30:16]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hey nul can i ask you a question about the new stuff?
[Oct 31-06 22:42:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ sure
[Oct 31-06 22:42:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I may not be able to answer though
[Oct 31-06 22:43:2]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well i've been dumping tons and tons of xp into projectile and i haven't noticed much improvment on the new spear attacks so would it be safe to assume they're more stat based?
[Oct 31-06 22:46:21]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ physical attacks have always been largely stat based, but if an attack uses a spear then projectile skill matters
[Oct 31-06 22:46:45]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ figuring out what skills effect an ability is pretty simple really
[Oct 31-06 22:46:57]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's mostly common sense
[Oct 31-06 22:47:3]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nodnod i figured as muc h
[Oct 31-06 22:47:11]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ much* just wanted to make sure :P
[Oct 31-06 22:47:13]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thanks boss
[Oct 31-06 23:3:32]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ gah darkshift is gone!
[Nov 2-06 11:0:41]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ got any recommendations or ideas for kataans, amundain??
[Nov 2-06 11:0:51]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ something that keeps me from dying so much lol
[Nov 2-06 11:1:5]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but seriously i think a demon related buffer would be neat
[Nov 2-06 11:1:27]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like a dark aura or something i dunno
[Nov 2-06 11:1:33]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ buffer is kinda blah
[Nov 2-06 11:1:55]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Nov 2-06 11:2:13]Morbis %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Something to make them pink!
[Nov 2-06 11:2:39]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if they get another def spell buffer would probably have to go
[Nov 2-06 11:2:51]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ do it up!
[Nov 2-06 11:3:7]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe an aura that acts like buffer but also harms any being that makes contact with the aura
[Nov 2-06 11:3:43]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ call of asmodeus
[Nov 2-06 11:3:45]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :O
[Nov 2-06 11:3:51]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the def-spell-that-hurts-things-too is already around as flamewall
[Nov 2-06 11:3:57]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh nod
[Nov 2-06 11:4:7]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ how about instead of hurt it slows them
[Nov 2-06 11:4:9]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ somethin different
[Nov 2-06 11:4:21]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod, I was just thinking, maybe def + debuff
[Nov 2-06 11:4:21]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so instead of like 5 hits per round they get 2-3
[Nov 2-06 11:4:47]Morbis %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Raise the user defence and lower the enemy defense at area.
[Nov 2-06 11:5:1]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ there is no slow or haste yet though, I have to add it... it'll be a while before all that's done
[Nov 2-06 11:5:43]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ k, saved all that in my notes, thanks guys
[Nov 2-06 11:5:51]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thank boss
[Nov 2-06 11:6:39]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ every time i die i get more xp from mobs lol
[Nov 2-06 11:7:5]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :D
[Nov 2-06 11:7:11]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what level are you
[Nov 2-06 11:7:15]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ 37 now
[Nov 2-06 11:7:21]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Nov 2-06 11:7:31]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that throne room in tenebrae is the bane to my existance
[Nov 2-06 11:7:45]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i get over zealous and they all slash and i fold like a cheap hooker
[Nov 2-06 11:8:47]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ haha
[Nov 3-06 0:42:24]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hey nulvect?
[Nov 3-06 0:42:44]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ is there any reason why monk spells don't work when your alignment is demonic?
[Nov 3-06 0:43:46]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ pd monks worship a benevolent diety
[Nov 3-06 0:44:18]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ any way to get 'dark' or 'black' monks?
[Nov 3-06 0:44:28]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe when you redo them?
[Nov 3-06 0:44:56]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well then 'dark monks' would basically be kataans that fight unarmed instead of with spears
[Nov 3-06 0:46:10]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it would be kind of cool to combine them into one class though, you get certain abils/spells when you alignment is good and other ones when it's bad?
[Nov 3-06 0:46:48]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ shrug
[Nov 3-06 0:47:2]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thinking about it, kataans will probably be more magic based than monks would be if they could be evil
[Nov 3-06 0:47:20]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but it would still take a decent amount of work to make it viable
[Nov 3-06 0:47:22]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod, just a thought i had, gonna be a while till monks anyway
[Nov 3-06 0:47:30]%^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Nulvect nods
[Nov 3-06 0:47:40]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like evil fist fighters who are very disciplined
[Nov 3-06 0:47:50]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe stealth :O
[Nov 3-06 0:48:14]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ kataans are the ones with stealth, monks would not be
[Nov 3-06 0:48:22]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah
[Nov 3-06 1:37:13]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i love the message for demonfire
[Nov 3-06 1:40:21]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ finally got it huh??
[Nov 3-06 1:40:33]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah i decided to level once :P
[Nov 3-06 1:40:41]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i was level 40 but i died down
[Nov 3-06 1:40:51]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, glad you like it
[Nov 3-06 1:41:15]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ now that I can watch someone use it I may have to adjust the cost though
[Nov 3-06 1:41:19]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just as a warning :P
[Nov 3-06 1:41:23]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :P
[Nov 3-06 1:41:51]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i suppose it'd be a rather bad idea to demonfire s1 :P
[Nov 3-06 1:42:5]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh so tempting with some of these rooms though
[Nov 3-06 1:42:27]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hey nulvect you ever do that necro spell you were thinking about?
[Nov 3-06 1:42:39]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no, not yet
[Nov 3-06 1:43:21]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ demonfire costs about 400  mp
[Nov 3-06 1:44:23]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just always that risk that someone might walk into me :(
[Nov 3-06 1:44:33]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ in s3 or somethin
[Nov 3-06 1:45:9]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's one nice thing about cw, at least if someone walks in the get the least amount of damage
[Nov 3-06 1:45:27]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ mines all straight up :P
[Nov 3-06 1:45:33]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ bam bam
[Nov 3-06 1:45:35]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yea it's like psistorm
[Nov 3-06 1:45:53]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, the cost looks fine for the moment
[Nov 3-06 1:46:5]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i like it
[Nov 3-06 1:46:7]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ :P
[Nov 3-06 1:46:13]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ good good
[Nov 3-06 1:46:37]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like i have 1600 mp and 400  mp every 2 rounds isn't too bad
[Nov 3-06 1:46:47]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but thats 3 demonfires for tene throne :P
[Nov 3-06 1:47:1]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ really?? hmm
[Nov 3-06 1:47:9]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ cause its not like hellfire
[Nov 3-06 1:47:17]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ mpwise
[Nov 3-06 1:47:19]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that might be too strong though, I'm not sure
[Nov 3-06 1:47:29]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hrm
[Nov 3-06 1:47:29]Nekor %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ he just has good stats ;)
[Nov 3-06 1:47:47]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ they're decent
[Nov 3-06 1:47:51]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not good :p
[Nov 3-06 1:48:5]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like if i demonfired in tene throne, it'd clear out my mp
[Nov 3-06 1:48:11]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ er
[Nov 3-06 1:48:13]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hellfire*

[Nov 3-06 21:56:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ took me like 2 hours to come up with that
[Nov 3-06 21:58:2]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the name is cool
[Nov 3-06 21:59:24]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ so when it absorbs some of the mobs power
[Nov 3-06 21:59:34]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ does it take sp? or make it last longer?
[Nov 3-06 22:1:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you'll just have to figure that out
[Nov 3-06 22:1:54]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Rohl nods
[Nov 3-06 22:4:28]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ awesome :)

[Nov 15-06 12:33:8]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ let me know how you like it, especially for the lower levels
[Nov 15-06 12:33:38]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hm, Torment doesnt do anything :/ supposed to be like that?
[Nov 15-06 12:33:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it does damage
[Nov 15-06 12:34:20]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah it does, but a little..
[Nov 15-06 12:35:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah given your level and all that seems ok
[Nov 15-06 12:35:18]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well I'll look at it
[Nov 15-06 12:35:22]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ tickles lightly to brown ram..
[Nov 15-06 12:35:52]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ 50 torments to go :D
[Nov 15-06 12:41:24]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ spear like abilities in bigger role now?
[Nov 15-06 12:41:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ not as big as I want yet, but yes
[Nov 15-06 12:42:52]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ darkmist and torment seems lil' weak, harder to level in beginning :/
[Nov 15-06 12:45:36]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nice to see spells failing, never saw :D
[Nov 15-06 12:46:24]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if doesnt count fear. heh
[Nov 15-06 12:47:36]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ fear is different now
[Nov 15-06 12:48:2]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ how?
[Nov 15-06 12:48:22]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or, do i have to figure it out? :)
[Nov 15-06 12:49:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it'll be fairly obvious
[Nov 15-06 12:49:18]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ first off it doesn't cost 700 mp per cast ;P
[Nov 15-06 12:49:26]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but you can find all that out yourself
[Nov 15-06 12:50:10]Aldhissla %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i didnt notice that it took 700 mp, maybe cus i had loads of mp back then :P
[Nov 15-06 13:12:26]Amundain %^BLUE%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ did we lose the ability to command the demons?
[Nov 15-06 13:12:40]Nulvect %^BLUE%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I haven't changed anything about summon yet
[Nov 15-06 13:12:46]Amundain %^BLUE%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hrm
[Nov 15-06 13:12:54]Amundain %^BLUE%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh there it is typo
[Nov 15-06 13:12:56]Amundain %^BLUE%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nm
[Nov 16-06 23:6:50]Rohl %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ sup amun
[Nov 16-06 23:18:57]Amundain %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nada man chillin
[Nov 17-06 0:6:2]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ an init spell that uses stealth?? I don't see how that would go together
[Nov 20-06 0:41:4]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Amundain and I were thinkin about it for a bit and we came up with this
[Nov 20-06 0:42:4]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Maybe a stealth/magic initiation attack? you channel energy into becomming temporarily invisible, or untraceable, and after about 2-3 rounds you hit them with a blast
[Nov 20-06 0:42:42]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ we couldn't really think of anything that wouldn't be mixed with an attack though :/
[Nov 20-06 0:43:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Nov 20-06 0:44:16]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I wasn't really planning on more attack spells
[Nov 20-06 0:44:26]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod, i was thinkin you'd say that :P
[Nov 20-06 0:44:34]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ we got quite a bit to work with, for killing
[Nov 20-06 0:44:42]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Nov 20-06 0:44:58]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i'm about 1 level off 50 :P
[Nov 20-06 0:45:2]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Rohl gets excited
[Nov 20-06 0:45:6]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Nov 20-06 0:47:26]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what about a blast like spell, that wouldn't do damage but it'd knock opponents out of the room?
[Nov 20-06 0:47:34]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that would  probably still be attack :P
[Nov 20-06 0:47:58]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or a single opponent* not all
[Nov 20-06 0:48:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Nov 20-06 0:48:12]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like sneak up and thrust them into the next room
[Nov 20-06 0:48:24]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well if it's not multiple then there's no point, clergy have cheap str so can bump easily
[Nov 20-06 0:48:26]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thta  might be cool for a diff class though
[Nov 20-06 0:48:34]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ true
[Nov 20-06 0:48:52]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I used to bump mobs around myself
[Nov 20-06 0:49:0]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod, i did when i xp'd merk
[Nov 20-06 0:49:18]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and other places where its serves advantage
[Nov 20-06 0:53:20]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it would be awesome but unlikely, if there were a spell that could make a person fade in and out of reality, or conciousnous or something
[Nov 20-06 0:53:42]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ walk around like nothins wrong then wham you fade out
[Nov 20-06 0:54:4]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or think they're fading in/out :P
[Nov 20-06 0:54:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ err, with what affect??
[Nov 20-06 0:54:56]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you cast this spell on them, they walk around, then suddenly they vanish and are effectively out of the game for a few rounds??
[Nov 20-06 0:55:6]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no they'd still be there
[Nov 20-06 0:55:18]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but like they would not be able to do anything
[Nov 20-06 0:55:24]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like every 2 rounds they would fade
[Nov 20-06 0:55:54]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and maybe experience something on the otherside
[Nov 20-06 0:56:10]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Nov 20-06 0:56:20]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ might be more of a mage-ish spell
[Nov 20-06 0:56:30]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ was just thinkin aloud :P
[Nov 20-06 0:56:50]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod, I think it sounds like a cool idea
[Nov 20-06 0:57:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hard to think of a way to fit it into kataans though
[Nov 20-06 0:57:4]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but maybe good for wizards
[Nov 20-06 0:57:16]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Nov 20-06 0:58:2]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ like maybe when they fade out there would be a creature in that reality that would beat them down
[Nov 20-06 0:58:22]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and the creature would get stronger as you did, but that sounds like a headache and a half to code
[Nov 20-06 0:58:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ probably not any harder than corona
[Nov 20-06 0:59:2]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i haven't seen that one yet
[Nov 20-06 0:59:24]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it was a pain, killed myself several times before I got it right
[Nov 20-06 0:59:42]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nodnod
[Nov 20-06 1:0:12]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i want to see a spell that is scary to experience, in a different way, kinda like the one i just thhought of
[Nov 20-06 1:0:26]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ just somethin thats like "wow what did i get hit with"
[Nov 20-06 1:0:50]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ would need some more work though, a spell that effectively is a summoned mob that can't be run away from would be kind of strong
[Nov 20-06 1:1:18]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Nov 20-06 1:1:26]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it'd need to be refined :P
[Nov 20-06 1:1:46]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it's a good idea though, I'll put it in my notes
[Nov 20-06 1:2:6]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if it were kataan, it could send them to asmodeus >:P
[Nov 20-06 1:2:18]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or maybe an evil wizard
[Nov 20-06 1:2:36]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but they dont usually deal with asmodeus
[Nov 20-06 1:2:58]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ except maybe to worship him
[Nov 20-06 1:3:4]%^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Rohl nods
[Nov 20-06 1:3:46]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ plenty of other demons they can actually call on though
[Nov 20-06 1:3:54]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nodnod
[Nov 20-06 1:4:30]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ orabus, i think is the demon that keeps hells fire burning
[Nov 20-06 1:4:44]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it could send you back with severe burns
[Nov 20-06 1:4:54]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and d.o.t
[Nov 20-06 1:4:56]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ >:P
[Nov 20-06 1:5:10]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ orabus?? from what mythos??
[Nov 20-06 1:5:26]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i dunno i read it somewhere awhile back
[Nov 20-06 1:5:38]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and i made a char on a mud named orabus cause of it, i'll look for it
[Nov 20-06 1:6:20]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i cant find anything on orabus :O
[Nov 20-06 1:6:22]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ lol
[Nov 20-06 1:6:58]Rohl %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ scratch that name :P
[Nov 20-06 1:9:14]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmmm
[Nov 20-06 13:11:1]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yay!
[Nov 20-06 13:11:7]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ got vortex >:D

[Nov 20-06 13:31:18]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ 179/300 lol :]
[Nov 20-06 13:31:40]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ heh
[Nov 21-06 3:33:7]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ will tame be back in?
[Nov 21-06 3:33:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yes
[Nov 21-06 3:33:27]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ for the better?

[Nov 21-06 3:33:35]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ sweet
[Nov 21-06 3:33:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the old tame was not only sucky, but there was a possible bug introduced having to do with it and remorting
[Nov 21-06 3:34:9]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ah :/
[Nov 21-06 3:34:25]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ prolly remorting with the tamed guys following you
[Nov 21-06 3:34:47]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i hope to some <year> tame wolf master :p
[Nov 21-06 3:35:5]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no, whoever coded it was smoking something laced with household cleaners and made it store stuff in the same place that gate does
[Nov 21-06 3:35:21]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ haha lol
[Nov 21-06 3:35:45]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and you'll never be able to tame the wolf master, he's a sentient being
[Nov 21-06 3:35:51]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh darn
[Nov 21-06 3:36:1]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the wolves in his forest, though...

[Nov 21-06 3:36:53]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod, np.. look for it to return right after summon and raise get redone.. it'll use a lot of the same stuff
[Nov 21-06 3:37:9]Vutalathau %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh alright cant wait

[Nov 23-06 0:9:50]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ always
[Nov 23-06 0:10:4]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ maybe you could rework that spell that kataans used to have that was abused and removed
[Nov 23-06 0:10:8]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ disease or something
[Nov 23-06 0:10:24]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ you prolly got to use it back then didn't you?
[Nov 23-06 0:10:44]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah, I am redoing it, but only for necros
[Nov 23-06 0:10:52]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ was it disease?
[Nov 23-06 0:10:54]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I really don't think kataans need any more attack spells
[Nov 23-06 0:11:0]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ yeah that was its name
[Nov 23-06 0:11:8]Amundain %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nodnod

[Dec 10-06 0:54:28]Geddoe %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ thought the list looked longer
[Dec 10-06 0:54:48]Geddoe %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ might just be in my head tho
[Dec 10-06 0:55:10]Geddoe %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ why you break somethin?

[Dec 10-06 1:3:22]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ uh, which one??
[Dec 10-06 1:3:30]Arcanis %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the one to put a spell in a flail
[Dec 10-06 1:3:38]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh, haven't gotten to that yet
[Dec 10-06 1:3:40]Arcanis %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ ahh
[Dec 10-06 1:4:8]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ turns out one of the latest abils I gave kataans gets way too strong at high levels
[Dec 10-06 1:4:50]Geddoe %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ skewer?
[Dec 10-06 1:5:4]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ nod
[Dec 10-06 3:36:25]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ man i love vigor
[Dec 12-06 21:55:31]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hey nulvect, are we gettin an sp regen spell?
[Dec 12-06 21:55:33]Geddoe %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ or ability
[Dec 15-06 12:10:56]Arcanis %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ was wondering when rootgrasp wears off could we get a leave message on that? i mean i sorta hate not knowing when it ends so i can recast it again..
[Dec 15-06 12:11:18]Arcanis %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i hope thats not hard or im askin for too much, just wondering
[Dec 15-06 12:13:22]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ well, it would be possible, but pretty spammy
[Dec 15-06 12:13:32]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ especially at lower levels when it lasts one round

[Mar 6-07 4:31:41]Nulvect %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ probably
[Mar 6-07 4:31:53]Goldenberry %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ b/c we're helpers not mains i guess

[Mar 21-07 1:7:3]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Nulvect shrugs
[Mar 21-07 22:8:13]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hey nul i have a ?
[Mar 21-07 22:9:1]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ when you resonate the bison i think it is...why does it give you con yet it doesn't show on your hp?
[Mar 21-07 22:10:5]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ because our bonus system isn't set up to give extra hp
[Mar 21-07 22:10:19]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ the bard song gives hp though i was told
[Mar 21-07 22:11:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that's a total hack though
[Mar 21-07 22:11:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I'm surprised it hasn't caused any problems
[Mar 21-07 22:11:59]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ then why have something to artifically raise con if it doesn't work? why not have it for a different stat?
[Mar 21-07 22:12:43]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it is meant to raise con, and it does
[Mar 21-07 22:13:5]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ but the point of raising con is to have more hp, which it doesnt do. right?
[Mar 21-07 22:13:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ no
[Mar 21-07 22:13:21]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ then what is the point?
[Mar 21-07 22:13:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ to have more con??
[Mar 21-07 22:13:41]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and the point of having more con is for more hp so you don't die..
[Mar 21-07 22:13:55]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ if you say so
[Mar 21-07 22:14:3]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ what other reason is there for con?
[Mar 21-07 22:16:35]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ -shrugs- that wasn't rhetorical, i really wanted to know what the other point to con was
[Mar 21-07 22:17:27]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ to take hits
[Mar 21-07 22:17:47]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ and does it help you take less damage with hits even though it doesn't show you with more hp?
[Mar 26-07 23:27:25]Hinata %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ i cant wear a shield?
[Mar 26-07 23:27:43]Electra %^YELLOW%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ depending are you wielding anything?

[Mar 31-07 22:2:34]Resolution %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ for supplication, why is it you have to be goodly aligned to use?
[Mar 31-07 22:4:28]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ monk faith is defined as being good only
[Mar 31-07 22:4:34]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Resolution frowns
[Mar 31-07 22:4:48]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I am not against making them work with either alignment, but that's how they are now
[Mar 31-07 22:4:56]%^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ Resolution nods

[Mar 31-07 22:6:58]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh... no problem
[Apr 2-07 2:17:41]Cowl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ it would be cool nul, if druids got a pet companion that they could choose when they create, or get to level 20 maybe
[Apr 2-07 2:18:3]Cowl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ that would get stronger as it faught and killed
[Apr 2-07 2:18:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ hmm
[Apr 2-07 3:0:4]Cowl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh and for that animal companion idea, perhaps you would call on your animal with somethin like a whistle, instead of summoning it.
[Apr 2-07 3:1:38]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ post it up
[Apr 2-07 3:1:42]Cowl %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ alright
[Apr 2-07 3:1:50]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ I'm knee-deep in chat code right now and I'll forget it

[Apr 5-07 22:36:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ oh, he's not on this line
[Apr 8-07 17:28:15]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<clergy>%^RESET%^ how's cleric going for you paranoia
[Apr 9-07 3:23:28]Skunk <clergy> hey nul, any reason why crushingblow doesn't work like backstab?
[Apr 9-07 3:23:44]Nulvect <clergy> in what way??
[Apr 9-07 3:24:8]Skunk <clergy> you can use another abil the same round it hits
[Apr 9-07 3:24:26]Nulvect <clergy> I dunno

[Jun 11-07 11:29:4]Providence <clergy> =D
[Jun 11-07 11:29:14]<clergy> Providence is to bishie for you
[Jun 11-07 11:30:0]<clergy> Resolution ignores
[Jun 11-07 11:30:20]<clergy> Providence hops up and down! "Resolution!"
[Jun 30-07 16:2:36]Providence <clergy> oo, doin somethin on kataan nulvect?
[Jun 30-07 16:3:4]Providence <clergy> ahh

[Jun 30-07 16:4:24]<clergy> Providence thinks
[Jun 30-07 16:4:42]Providence <clergy> im good =p
[Jun 30-07 16:5:16]<clergy> Providence cant wait lol
[Jun 30-07 16:5:32]Providence <clergy> i would just power up to it but um goin at elite with low stats like this was highly unadvised lol
[Jul 1-07 23:7:21]Kai <clergy> Hmm why isn't whirlwind a AE move?
[Jul 1-07 23:7:45]Kai <clergy> Nope
[Jul 1-07 23:9:23]Kai <clergy> Yeah I read that. Would be nice to have an AE move again.
[Jul 2-07 1:23:28]Kai <clergy> Yo Nully. You looking to give an AE spells to Druids?
[Jul 2-07 1:25:28]Kai <clergy> Nod. I just thought that whirlwind could be both an AE move and 1v1 spell. Like "whirlwind all".
[Jul 3-07 15:21:23]Providence <clergy> *flex*
[Jul 3-07 15:23:9]Providence <clergy> only other thing ill remort to would be thug or assassin
[Jul 3-07 15:30:31]Skunk <clergy> pfft
[Jul 3-07 15:30:45]Skunk <clergy> demon assassin is played out
[Jul 3-07 15:30:53]Skunk <clergy> and demon thug is played out too
[Jul 3-07 15:31:13]Skunk <clergy> when i went demon i went thug and then all of a sudden there were like 6 or 8 of em
[Jul 3-07 15:50:25]Providence <clergy> played out meaning theres like 5 billion of em :P
[Jul 3-07 15:50:37]Skunk <clergy> yea pretty much
[Jul 3-07 15:50:39]Providence <clergy> im on it give me a sec
[Jul 3-07 15:50:45]Providence <clergy> how long u on for
[Jul 3-07 15:50:53]Skunk <clergy> i was playing the thug yesterday to get a feel for the new version

[Jul 3-07 15:51:13]Skunk <clergy> monk is the one i want buff anyway
[Jul 3-07 15:51:25]Skunk <clergy> purely physical monk for me ;)
[Jul 3-07 15:51:51]Providence <clergy> lol
[Jul 3-07 15:52:17]Providence <clergy> hopefully monk still says the same afterwards
[Jul 6-07 2:33:34]Kai <clergy> Daos
[Jul 6-07 2:34:30]Kai <clergy> Daos, are you able to tell me if Pounce is acutally in the game yet?
[Jul 6-07 2:34:44]Daos <clergy> yeah, let this video finish

[Jul 8-07 3:11:46]Providence <clergy> nul was wondering if you could take a detour and perhaps toss us monks, channel?
[Jul 8-07 3:19:36]Kai <clergy> yeah do it! I wana get providence
[Jul 8-07 3:23:12]<clergy> Providence laughs
[Jul 8-07 3:26:30]Kai <clergy> <3 providence
[Jul 8-07 19:49:21]Providence <clergy> oh yeah how many elite monks r out there?
[Jul 8-07 19:49:27]Skunk <clergy> none
[Jul 8-07 19:49:33]Providence <clergy> sweet
[Jul 8-07 22:6:58]Providence <clergy> hey nul, was wondering if you could toss us monks somethin somethin *nudges* =p
[Jul 8-07 22:7:6]<clergy> Providence coughs channel coughs
[Jul 8-07 22:9:0]Providence <clergy> a self booster for monks like i think gongra suggested on the monk board
[Jul 8-07 22:9:10]Providence <clergy> on monk board that is
[Jul 8-07 22:9:42]Providence <clergy> monks doo ooo i must be low lvl
[Jul 16-07 15:5:9]Yin <clergy> hellfire is 25 right
[Jul 16-07 15:5:13]Yin <clergy> ?
[Jul 17-07 4:19:41]Bonnie <clergy> again?
[Jul 23-07 21:21:21]Yin <clergy> to all my clergies in da house MAKE SOME NOISE!
[Jul 23-07 23:1:46]Yin <clergy> hrmm hellfire seems to be ... umm wierd
[Jul 25-07 4:24:58]Yin <clergy> hellfire makes you skip a round randomly
[Aug 4-07 15:27:58]Yin <clergy> ya know whats weird, im a magic user that uses ashes (a guild item) when im in that area in merk and have to offer ashes, i cant but i sure can sacrifice them.... wierd huh
[Aug 4-07 15:28:20]Chia <clergy> huh?
[Aug 4-07 15:28:42]Chia <clergy> y are u offering them?
[Aug 4-07 15:28:46]Yin <clergy> hey Chia
[Aug 4-07 15:29:20]Yin <clergy> there is a place in merk that instead of corpses the monster turns into ashes
[Aug 4-07 15:29:52]Chia <clergy> nod
[Aug 4-07 15:30:16]Chia <clergy> don't offer ashes
[Aug 4-07 15:30:32]Chia <clergy> leave them there
[Aug 4-07 15:30:40]Yin <clergy> ooo
[Aug 4-07 15:30:44]Chia <clergy> get all from ashes
[Aug 4-07 15:31:12]<clergy> Yin is too lazy to put in diamond one after the other
[Aug 4-07 15:31:40]Chia <clergy> then leave them there....
[Aug 4-07 15:31:54]Yin <clergy> nah i can just sacrifice them
[Aug 4-07 15:32:12]Yin <clergy> just wondering why i cant offer them
[Aug 4-07 15:32:24]Chia <clergy> ask a imm
[Aug 4-07 15:32:44]Yin <clergy> lol well considering Nul can see this i was gonna just let him read it
[Aug 7-07 1:30:44]Sik <clergy> boost, heal, scry
[Aug 7-07 1:33:38]Sik <clergy> have pain now, thanks nul, makes a huge difference
[Aug 7-07 3:29:42]Sik <clergy> nul, is it accurate that we should have to wait an extra round to attack again after healing while in combat?
[Aug 7-07 3:31:50]Sik <clergy> k, just checking
[Aug 7-07 3:32:18]Sik <clergy> cool, thanks
[Aug 7-07 21:11:50]Sik <clergy> hey nul, should i be idle hitting after using dispell?
[Aug 7-07 21:20:29]Sik <clergy> nod
[Aug 7-07 23:32:52]Sik <clergy> ahh, wasn't sure what level you put it in at
[Aug 9-07 22:38:29]Sik <clergy> nul does cleric alignment go down with any of our attack spells?
[Aug 9-07 22:39:19]Sik <clergy> well that's cool and all, but is that really fair? when no one is active enough to party with, that really puts a hurting on us
[Aug 9-07 22:40:21]Sik <clergy> and if you think about it, we really aren't hurting things, we are praying to god to hurt them for us, so his alignment should go down not ours ;)
[Aug 9-07 22:41:17]Sik <clergy> in one run through s1 and halfway through s2 my alignment went down 3 ranks, that's quite a bit for a short time
[Aug 9-07 22:43:35]Sik <clergy> and of course it would be the spells that do the most damage...
[Aug 9-07 22:44:21]Sik <clergy> right now i have 2 spells and 2 prayers, the one prayer only works on undead, oh which there aren't many for low levels, and the other is really low damage
[Aug 9-07 22:44:43]Sik <clergy> and wound won't work until you do enough pains
[Aug 9-07 22:45:7]Sik <clergy> think you could lower the amount it takes alignment down, 3 ranks is a lot for so short a time
[Aug 9-07 22:45:33]Sik <clergy> 3 ranks in about half an hour of xping
[Aug 9-07 22:45:39]Sik <clergy> that sounds right to you?
[Aug 9-07 22:46:33]Sik <clergy> my only saving grace is that i can wade in the pool since i can't kill the demons in s3
[Aug 9-07 22:47:39]Sik <clergy> i really like the changes you have made to clerics, they have a lot of potential, but if they aren't really playable then people won't play them
[Aug 9-07 22:48:29]Sik <clergy> also, is it illegal to wade the pool while idling?
[Aug 9-07 22:50:41]Sik <clergy> and does wading the pool even raise alingment?
[Aug 9-07 22:50:59]Sik <clergy> cause i have been in here for a while and haven't seen it go up
[Aug 9-07 22:51:37]Sik <clergy> i understand, and i would love to just boost/heal people
[Aug 9-07 22:51:49]Sik <clergy> but with as many active players as we have...
[Aug 9-07 22:51:55]Sik <clergy> kinda hard
[Aug 9-07 22:52:35]Sik <clergy> can you tell me if levin is a spell or a prayer?
[Aug 9-07 22:52:47]Sik <clergy> well poo, it says spell
[Aug 9-07 22:52:55]Sik <clergy> i guess that makes alignment lower as well?
[Aug 9-07 22:53:21]Sik <clergy> well you said earlier that prayers don't lower alignment while spells do
[Aug 9-07 22:53:53]Sik <clergy> so i'm hoping that levin won't lower alignment cause that will basically be a clerics saving grace, to be an angel
[Aug 9-07 22:55:3]Sik <clergy> was just checking, any idea when or if massacre and holyfire are coming back?
[Aug 9-07 22:58:49]Sik <clergy> are they broken or just need to be redone?
[Aug 9-07 23:1:7]Sik <clergy> well that sucks
[Aug 9-07 23:1:23]Sik <clergy> too strong probably?
[Aug 9-07 23:4:21]Sik <clergy> good ;)
[Aug 9-07 23:7:5]Sik <clergy> thanks for putting up with me nul, i know i can be a pain sometimes
[Aug 9-07 23:7:15]<clergy> Nulvect shrugs
[Aug 9-07 23:7:53]Sik <clergy> yea, it's been that way on a lot of muds for way too long
[Aug 9-07 23:8:21]Sik <clergy> i'm down with making xp by boosting and healing, i just wish we had more active playerbase
[Aug 9-07 23:9:31]<clergy> Sik nods.
[Aug 9-07 23:10:51]Sik <clergy> heh, you slacking is doing a lot more then any other imms i've known on a lot of muds
[Aug 9-07 23:11:3]Sik <clergy> one of the best things they could have done was make you an imm :D
[Aug 9-07 23:13:50]<clergy> Nulvect shrugs
[Aug 9-07 23:14:24]Sik <clergy> i'm thinking more big picture ;)
[Aug 9-07 23:14:36]Sik <clergy> you have done a lot since you became imm
[Aug 11-07 17:59:42]Sik <clergy> hey nul, when i do a limbs i get a what? after it
[Aug 11-07 18:7:46]Sik <clergy> it's good now
[Aug 12-07 21:44:12]Sik <clergy> mornin nul
[Aug 12-07 21:44:52]Sik <clergy> 3:44 ;)
[Aug 12-07 21:45:24]Sik <clergy> it's 3 hours right now, till you guys change time, then it's 2 hours
[Aug 12-07 21:45:32]Sik <clergy> and yea, it's morning :D
[Aug 12-07 21:45:38]Sik <clergy> for me at least
[Aug 12-07 21:45:52]Sik <clergy> hows things in the bay?
[Aug 12-07 21:46:32]Sik <clergy> cool, i'm flying into oakland for labor day weekend
[Aug 12-07 21:46:44]Sik <clergy> gonna go visit family in the napa valley
[Aug 12-07 21:47:48]Sik <clergy> at least hurricane flossie missed us over here :D
[Aug 12-07 21:48:6]Sik <clergy> its headed your way i think
[Aug 12-07 21:49:34]Sik <clergy> i hate to tell you this, but if you wanted the healing spells to take 2 rounds cure doesn't, not sure if i have high enough skill to make it 1 round or if you didn't add that ye
[Aug 12-07 21:50:22]<clergy> Nulvect shrugs
[Aug 12-07 21:50:36]<clergy> Sik nods.
[Aug 12-07 21:50:58]Sik <clergy> just thought i would let you know
[Aug 24-07 22:2:46]Skunk <clergy> hey nul, what did you have in mind for monks?
[Aug 24-07 22:3:30]Skunk <clergy> am i going to be uber screwed as a demon monk?
[Aug 24-07 22:31:7]Skunk <clergy> you couldn't make it possible to be a black or dark monk?
[Aug 24-07 22:31:45]Skunk <clergy> but kataans use weapon abils, not melee
[Aug 24-07 22:32:19]Skunk <clergy> it would be cool if you made it so some spells would only show up for bad alignment and the other spells only showed up for good alignment
[Aug 24-07 22:32:29]Skunk <clergy> almost mix two subs in one
[Aug 24-07 22:33:11]Skunk <clergy> like good monks would get some healing and maybe some personal buffs and dark monks get a couple damage spells and some debuffs or something
[Aug 24-07 22:34:25]Skunk <clergy> so i'm pretty much screwed as a demon monk then
[Aug 24-07 22:35:7]Skunk <clergy> it's not possible to remort and change your race anymore is it?
[Aug 24-07 22:35:29]Skunk <clergy> so the only way to change race is to ressurect?
[Aug 24-07 22:38:31]Skunk <clergy> well that kinda sucks
[Aug 27-07 17:35:25]<clergy> Tara misses lifewarp
[Aug 28-07 19:47:41]Warrick <clergy> thank you fellow cleric
[Aug 28-07 19:47:45]Kazuma <clergy> np
[Sep 3-07 17:45:47]Kaotic <clergy> just a side note, was thinkin along with necros kataans should get umbra
[Sep 3-07 17:46:37]Skunk <clergy> i could see that making a little sense
[Sep 3-07 17:46:39]Kaotic <clergy> of course, ours wouldnt be as great as a necros
[Sep 3-07 17:47:11]Kaotic <clergy> ahh
[Sep 3-07 17:48:7]Skunk <clergy> chaoswall?
[Sep 3-07 17:48:7]Kaotic <clergy> or perhaps somethin like flamewall 'cept more hell/demonish
[Sep 3-07 17:48:19]Kaotic <clergy> lol skunk i always like how you think on the same line :p
[Sep 3-07 17:50:10]Kaotic <clergy> lol hellshield
[Sep 3-07 17:51:18]Kaotic <clergy> yeah lol
[Sep 3-07 17:51:36]Skunk <clergy> chaoswall or chaosshield could work
[Sep 3-07 17:52:24]Kaotic <clergy> kk
[Sep 3-07 17:52:26]Skunk <clergy> will do when i get a minute
[Sep 3-07 17:53:4]Kaotic <clergy> sweet 8 pts of int
[Sep 3-07 17:55:58]Kaotic <clergy> woaaah a shnazzy idea just popped in my head gotta post this up for that def spell
[Sep 3-07 18:1:16]Kaotic <clergy> not -too- sure about my ideas :p
[Sep 3-07 20:31:49]Kaotic <clergy> lol nulvect you read my post on the defensive spell on kataan board :p
[Sep 3-07 21:37:27]Kaotic <clergy> put a cap on it?
[Sep 3-07 21:44:53]<clergy> Nulvect shrug
[Sep 4-07 1:59:58]Skunk <clergy> any chance of a spell kinda like corona where we travel through the underworld to get where we are going?
[Sep 4-07 2:3:24]Skunk <clergy> eh, worth a shot ;)
[Sep 4-07 2:3:46]Uzamaki <clergy> I think clergy need a popemobile.
[Sep 4-07 2:3:52]Skunk <clergy> agreed ;)
[Sep 4-07 2:3:56]Uzamaki <clergy> like a proivate coach for us holy rollers.
[Sep 4-07 2:4:8]Skunk <clergy> what about us unholy rollers?
[Sep 4-07 2:4:12]Uzamaki <clergy> whatcha say to that, Nulvy?
[Sep 4-07 2:4:24]Uzamaki <clergy> them especially
[Sep 4-07 2:4:30]Skunk <clergy> ;)
[Sep 4-07 2:6:0]Skunk <clergy> hey uzi?
[Sep 4-07 2:6:8]Uzamaki <clergy> yeah, Skunk?
[Sep 4-07 2:6:22]Skunk <clergy> you down with the illy?
[Sep 4-07 2:6:40]Uzamaki <clergy> Me and him, we dont fight. Cant levin him
[Sep 4-07 2:6:46]Uzamaki <clergy> he's holier than thu
[Sep 4-07 2:6:50]Uzamaki <clergy> thou
[Sep 4-07 2:6:52]Skunk <clergy> punk ;)
[Sep 4-07 2:7:6]Skunk <clergy> who would have the audacity to be holier then the uzi ;)
[Sep 11-07 1:0:25]Kaotic <clergy> clergys get an extra mp for wis?
[Sep 21-07 14:52:27]Lujan <clergy> its true, imms here have way too much power, i'm just gonna leave
[Sep 21-07 14:54:21]Lujan <clergy> yhea yhea, imms can control names, whats next, how much time you play...maybe how often you play...its just a matter of time
[Sep 21-07 14:54:35]Lujan <clergy> i'm out,
[Sep 21-07 14:54:57]Lujan <clergy> those names and Nomad had nothing in common
[Sep 21-07 14:55:11]Lujan <clergy> Nomad is an actual name
[Sep 21-07 14:55:29]Lujan <clergy> its something you actually call people, you never call people Imastupidmoron
[Sep 21-07 14:56:53]Lujan <clergy> no, its not,...but alright, then lets take a look at all the names
[Sep 21-07 14:57:39]Lujan <clergy> Yang, part of Ying and Yang, Uzamaki, name of a famous Japenese Yojimbo....oh...I see, so names created before the bull rule are alright
[Sep 21-07 14:58:49]Lujan <clergy> so it applies to some and not others.....
[Sep 21-07 14:59:29]Lujan <clergy> look, i'm not here to argue, I was here to just mud and have my fun, you blew that for me, you ruined it, go have your beer and enjoy yourself now. I don't need this crap..its stupid, its dumb
[Sep 21-07 22:54:15]Kaotic <clergy> i been dying to ask, how did you ever do your stats on your kataan :p
[Sep 21-07 22:55:29]Kaotic <clergy> ahh, so theres a diff way of statting compared to old one
[Sep 21-07 22:55:43]Kaotic <clergy> haha vortex
[Sep 21-07 22:56:25]Kaotic <clergy> well you dont have to reveal your stats at elite but rougly when did you think you wanted to hit elite
[Sep 21-07 22:57:1]Kaotic <clergy> haha
[Sep 21-07 22:57:5]Kaotic <clergy> thanks
[Sep 21-07 22:57:21]Kaotic <clergy> mhmm old demonfire
[Sep 21-07 22:57:31]A shadow <clergy> you were already elite when you me and smite would do drow right?
[Sep 21-07 22:57:53]Kaotic <clergy> lol old blue dragon para
[Sep 21-07 22:58:11]Kaotic <clergy> haha
[Sep 22-07 0:1:44]Kaotic <clergy> nul wanted to talk to you about uhh druids getting heal back
[Sep 22-07 0:2:10]Kaotic <clergy> it was like the best way for them to keep align up since theres not many places to keep there alignment up
[Sep 22-07 0:2:20]Kaotic <clergy> since dab worked on them
[Sep 28-07 22:4:55]Kaotic <clergy> clergy power raaaw
[Sep 29-07 2:46:45]Bonnie <clergy> eagleblitz seems to do the same amout of dmg as whirlwind
[Sep 29-07 2:46:57]<clergy> Nulvect shrugs
[Sep 29-07 2:47:19]Bonnie <clergy> ooh mister mstry!
[Sep 29-07 21:51:33]Bonnie <clergy> Hey nulvect
[Sep 29-07 21:51:53]Bonnie <clergy> I had an idea for a buff last night
[Sep 29-07 21:52:19]Bonnie <clergy> Its called "Natures Swiftness" And it only incs the number of idles that you can do in a round.
[Sep 29-07 21:53:19]Bonnie <clergy> that sound any good?
[Sep 29-07 21:53:57]Bonnie <clergy> oh
[Sep 29-07 21:54:11]Bonnie <clergy> I thought it would go well with the buff line for druids is all
[Sep 29-07 21:56:7]Bonnie <clergy> fits with all the animal buffs, ah well :) just a thought :)
[Sep 29-07 21:56:25]Bonnie <clergy> neat :D
[Oct 20-07 22:42:40]Sik <clergy> nod, it was pretty cheap
[Oct 20-07 22:44:20]Sik <clergy> 280mp for 4 mobs
[Oct 20-07 22:44:50]Sik <clergy> hehe
[Oct 20-07 22:45:20]Sik <clergy> 450ish for 4 mobs
[Oct 20-07 22:45:34]<clergy> Sik nods.
[Oct 20-07 22:45:40]Sik <clergy> it's a wicked rad spell
[Oct 21-07 2:46:35]Nenet <clergy> what exactly do kataans summon?
[Oct 21-07 2:46:55]Stormbringer <clergy> several different demons I believe
[Oct 21-07 2:46:55]Pulse <clergy> the summon list is iffy
[Oct 21-07 2:46:59]Nenet <clergy> nice
[Oct 21-07 2:47:21]Nenet <clergy> i am already satanic so that would be fun
[Oct 21-07 2:47:49]Stormbringer <clergy> eventually the summons will get upgraded
[Oct 21-07 2:48:3]Sik <clergy> yea, that's what damien is waiting for, raises/summons upgrade
[Oct 24-07 0:28:51]Kaotic <clergy> rofl no
[Oct 24-07 0:28:57]Kaotic <clergy> maxed summoning and faith and md ...
[Oct 24-07 0:29:7]Kaotic <clergy> apparently i also need a 4th skill...
[Oct 24-07 0:29:31]Kaotic <clergy> says in help file
[Oct 24-07 0:29:41]Kaotic <clergy> oh nvm
[Oct 24-07 0:29:57]Kaotic <clergy> but it used to be faith/summoning =[
[Oct 24-07 0:30:39]Kaotic <clergy> shouldnt it go like that anyways, like thats how we got hellfire/demonfire
[Oct 24-07 0:31:9]Kaotic <clergy> oh i mean i havent seen that done on a lot of classes usually 2 is the most i see with skill requirements
[Oct 24-07 0:31:39]Kaotic <clergy> ahh
[Oct 24-07 0:32:19]Kaotic <clergy> lol if only magic attack wasnt expensive, this will take me like another week =[
[Oct 24-07 22:3:4]Kaotic <clergy> well nul dang you =[
[Oct 24-07 22:3:18]Kaotic <clergy> would have been simpler to simply give it to us rofl :P
[Oct 27-07 18:19:19]Nenet <clergy> if i want to work on skills for implale, which weapon and skill do i use?
[Oct 27-07 18:19:25]Nenet <clergy> impale
[Oct 27-07 18:19:31]Skunk <clergy> a spear perhaps?
[Oct 27-07 18:19:55]Nenet <clergy> okay, thanks yes i have a spear, so which skill would it come under? :)
[Oct 27-07 18:20:13]Nenet <clergy> blade?
[Oct 27-07 18:20:27]Skunk <clergy> a spear is something you throw, so perhaps projectile?
[Oct 27-07 18:20:35]Stormbringer <clergy> projectile
[Oct 27-07 18:20:43]Nenet <clergy> hmm, i have impale as a command
[Oct 27-07 18:20:45]Skunk <clergy> the way i said it was more fun stormy :P
[Oct 27-07 18:20:59]Nenet <clergy> hehe skunk
[Oct 27-07 18:20:59]Stormbringer <clergy> if it is made correctly :)
[Oct 27-07 18:21:7]Stormbringer <clergy> yup yup yup
[Oct 27-07 18:21:19]Nenet <clergy> so i work on projectile for impale?
[Oct 27-07 18:21:25]Skunk <clergy> aye
[Oct 27-07 18:21:31]Nenet <clergy> ok thanks :)
[Oct 27-07 18:21:33]Stormbringer <clergy> I was looking at another screen while typing and didn't notice your answer till I had hit enter
[Oct 27-07 18:21:45]Skunk <clergy> no worries
[Oct 27-07 18:22:1]Nenet <clergy> i think of impale as something someone lands on, lengthwise, like you see in movies hehe
[Oct 27-07 18:22:25]Skunk <clergy> you can poke em with the pointy end too, they don't have to fall on it ;)
[Oct 27-07 18:22:31]Stormbringer <clergy> it is, just think of it sideways with a spear ;)
[Oct 27-07 18:22:43]Nenet <clergy> i know i know, hehe - just invisioning impaling as falling on a church spire thingy
[Oct 27-07 18:22:57]Nenet <clergy> but sideways impaling is good too
[Oct 27-07 18:23:1]Skunk <clergy> have either of you seen hot fuzz?
[Oct 27-07 18:23:7]Nenet <clergy> funny movie, yes!
[Oct 27-07 18:23:17]Stormbringer <clergy> nope
[Oct 27-07 18:23:21]Skunk <clergy> when the church spire fell on that guy :D
[Oct 27-07 18:23:31]Nenet <clergy> yeh
[Oct 27-07 18:23:33]Skunk <clergy> it's pretty funny stormy
[Oct 27-07 18:23:43]Nenet <clergy> if you like Shaun of the Dead, you'd like Hot Fuzz
[Oct 27-07 18:23:59]Stormbringer <clergy> I am sure I will see it soon as it comes to the movie stations
[Oct 27-07 18:24:9]Skunk <clergy> movie stations?
[Oct 27-07 18:24:23]Stormbringer <clergy> HBO, TMC, Starz, etc
[Oct 27-07 18:24:27]Skunk <clergy> ahhh
[Oct 27-07 18:24:37]Skunk <clergy> and on that note
[Oct 27-07 18:24:39]Stormbringer <clergy> got em all, now in HD =D
[Oct 28-07 22:18:35]<clergy> Kaotic gives Nulvect a thumbs up on kataans.
[Nov 3-07 1:27:22]Kaotic <clergy> hrm, will corrupt be back :P
[Nov 3-07 1:29:33]Kaotic <clergy> ahh
[Nov 3-07 1:29:43]Kaotic <clergy> yes i agree the summons need some tweaking
[Nov 3-07 1:29:49]Skunk <clergy> some?
[Nov 3-07 1:29:55]Kaotic <clergy> k, none
[Nov 3-07 1:30:3]Skunk <clergy> they need a full revamp...

[Dec 2-07 1:58:34]Sik <clergy> oh, but it does ;)
[Dec 2-07 1:59:22]Sik <clergy> earlier i was arena'ing with kaotic, he would fear, demonfire, vortex, or vice versa, then fear again, and i wouldn't have a chance to use anything, and i was spamming
[Dec 2-07 2:0:10]Sik <clergy> fear was just paraing me, not making me leave the room in the arena
[Dec 2-07 2:5:36]Sik <clergy> hehe, kaotic will love me :D
[Dec 2-07 2:6:2]Kaotic <clergy> i still love you sik <3
[Dec 2-07 2:6:26]Sik <clergy> eh, i don't have it ;)
[Dec 2-07 2:6:32]Sik <clergy> but kaotic will still love me ;)
[Dec 2-07 2:9:6]Kaotic <clergy> make it last longer but used less often :P
[Dec 2-07 2:9:8]Sik <clergy> cool

[Dec 4-07 1:29:20]Kaotic <clergy> summons changed yet?
[Dec 4-07 1:42:54]Kaotic <clergy> kk
[Dec 15-07 23:54:53]Kazuma <clergy> cleric powah!
[Dec 15-07 23:55:31]Kazuma <clergy> Gotta love that bodyward spell nul, very cool on your part. It'd be cool at lvl 50 if an amulet could be created that does the armour thing and also has a regen to it.
[Dec 15-07 23:56:24]Kazuma <clergy> Oooo, nice
[Dec 15-07 23:57:16]Kazuma <clergy> what are your plans?
[Dec 15-07 23:57:18]<clergy> Kazuma tries to gain info.
[Dec 15-07 23:58:0]Kazuma <clergy> Oooo, mind sharing any more? or can you?
[Dec 15-07 23:59:20]Kazuma <clergy> Awww
[Dec 15-07 23:59:26]Kazuma <clergy> :(, just a hint? :)
[Dec 16-07 0:10:52]Kazuma <clergy> Hmmm
[Dec 16-07 0:13:48]Kazuma <clergy> Man, I was thinking, maybe a ward that can cast peace
[Dec 16-07 0:14:12]Kazuma <clergy> but that seems almost over powered, specially with those with inits.
[Dec 16-07 0:14:16]Kazuma <clergy> Hmmm.
[Dec 30-07 0:23:16]Saito <clergy> what should I train for spells?
[Dec 30-07 0:23:34]Saito <clergy> and do druids get any attack abilities
[Dec 30-07 0:23:38]Saito <clergy> both
[Dec 30-07 0:23:52]Bonnie <clergy> umm i dont know about attack abilitys
[Dec 30-07 0:24:4]Bonnie <clergy> I have put a fair bit of xp into Wis
[Dec 30-07 0:24:18]Bonnie <clergy>  every 4 wis = +1stat to your buffs
[Dec 30-07 0:24:30]Bonnie <clergy> i just max all spell skills
[Dec 30-07 0:24:42]Bonnie <clergy> we get attack spells
[Dec 30-07 0:25:4]Bonnie <clergy> eagleblitz, freeze, thorns, vinegrasp,whirlwind
[Dec 30-07 0:25:50]Saito <clergy> so, which skills should I train
[Dec 30-07 0:26:0]Bonnie <clergy> i didnt think conjuring effect any of my spells, but its been training while i have been useing whirlwind. so i have maxed that one also
[Dec 30-07 0:26:8]Bonnie <clergy> all skills under you "magic" list
[Dec 30-07 0:26:44]Bonnie <clergy> thats what I have done
[Dec 30-07 0:26:52]Bonnie <clergy> works for me *shrugs*
[Dec 31-07 3:8:42]Saito <clergy> interesting.  Lot of people becoming clergy now
[Dec 31-07 21:57:18]Bonnie <clergy> Hey Nulvect got a quick question for ya
[Dec 31-07 21:58:28]Bonnie <clergy> I was wondering why at elite druids elite abil seems to be so solo orentated? while the whole way up to elite their buffs seem to make them more of a party type class?
[Dec 31-07 21:59:26]Bonnie <clergy> not maken any comlaints :)
[Dec 31-07 21:59:36]Bonnie <clergy> I think they rock. I was just wondeirng is all
[Dec 31-07 22:0:4]Bonnie <clergy> Just thought that along with the solor morphs that their might be a morph that adds to casting sdtuff?
[Dec 31-07 22:0:26]Bonnie <clergy> so a Caster Druid could use morph
[Dec 31-07 22:0:34]Bonnie <clergy> COuld morph into a spirite or somthing?
[Dec 31-07 22:0:46]Bonnie <clergy> just a thought :D\
[Dec 31-07 22:1:0]Bonnie <clergy> mm nods*
[Dec 31-07 22:1:24]Bonnie <clergy> nods
[Dec 31-07 22:2:8]Bonnie <clergy> LIke i said, they kick butt :)
[Dec 31-07 22:6:28]Bonnie <clergy> nods :)
[Dec 31-07 22:6:30]Bonnie <clergy> thats cool
[Dec 31-07 22:7:0]Bonnie <clergy> I was just wondering is all. I think they have enough party stuff. Every one loves the party buffs :0
[Dec 31-07 22:7:36]Bonnie <clergy> am Top heavy on the wis side of things. Am going to have to raise some other stats to see what moprh is like
[Dec 31-07 22:8:22]Bonnie <clergy> heh pickd a bad race to be a physical atteker lol
[Dec 31-07 22:9:32]Bonnie <clergy> yeah heh :)
[Dec 31-07 22:9:51]Bonnie <clergy> makes it all the more of a challenge
[Dec 31-07 22:10:21]Bonnie <clergy> yikes
[Dec 31-07 22:11:53]Bonnie <clergy> this is true
[Dec 31-07 22:35:48]Bonnie <clergy> Nulvect are you still there?
[Dec 31-07 22:59:21]Bonnie <clergy> i dont remember what i was going to ask you now
[Dec 31-07 22:59:25]Bonnie <clergy> nm heh
[Dec 31-07 23:59:7]Saito <clergy> does scry ever work?
[Dec 31-07 23:59:13]Bonnie <clergy> yep
[Dec 31-07 23:59:59]Bonnie <clergy> Scry works, but if they have high wis i dont think you can scry them
[Jan 1-08 1:29:32]Saito <clergy> hey bonnie alcohol is great for restoring mp?  Or is there something better?

[Feb 23-08 13:41:55]El <clergy> the thing i find wierd about commanding my demon is that it doesn't even igrone me like before
[Feb 23-08 16:36:27]Cenn <clergy> absorb vs darkmist at low levels?
[Feb 23-08 16:37:9]El <clergy> i just used torment all the way
[Feb 23-08 16:37:19]Cenn <clergy> really?
[Feb 23-08 16:37:25]Cenn <clergy> is it better?
[Feb 23-08 16:39:35]El <clergy> not sure i liked it
[Feb 23-08 16:39:39]El <clergy> cool name
[Feb 23-08 16:42:52]Cenn <clergy> they made lower levels harder aye
[Feb 23-08 16:43:2]El <clergy> yup
[Feb 24-08 2:20:18]El <clergy> hey nul demon quest in?
[Feb 24-08 2:20:24]Cenn <clergy> demon quest is always in
[Feb 24-08 2:20:30]Cenn <clergy> its just vampire/lich/dragon that arent
[Feb 24-08 2:20:44]El <clergy> i thought i heard that they took it out
[Feb 24-08 2:21:24]Stormbringer <clergy> no, it is in
[Feb 24-08 2:21:38]El <clergy> ah just wondering
[Feb 24-08 2:21:42]Stormbringer <clergy> though it is more restricted than before
[Feb 24-08 2:21:52]Cenn <clergy> its changed?
[Feb 24-08 2:21:58]El <clergy> meaning?
[Feb 24-08 2:22:14]Stormbringer <clergy> meaning there are certain times it will work
[Feb 24-08 2:22:18]Cenn <clergy> same with angel?
[Feb 24-08 2:22:28]Stormbringer <clergy> yeah, I believe so
[Feb 24-08 2:22:32]Cenn <clergy> weird
[Feb 24-08 2:23:2]Stormbringer <clergy> not sure if it will stay the way it is or get revamped again
[Feb 24-08 2:32:59]El <clergy> true that Nul
[Feb 24-08 22:21:3]El <clergy> nul serious i think there is a problem with summons and reveling powers
[Feb 24-08 22:21:49]El <clergy> i whenever i type command nightmare to revel powers it doesn't work
[Feb 24-08 22:22:11]El <clergy> did it like 50 times in a row nothing
[Feb 24-08 22:23:17]El <clergy> i feel like a noob can't type lol
[Feb 24-08 22:23:29]El <clergy> sorry about the trouble
[Feb 24-08 22:25:25]El <clergy> with me its always the typing errors lol
[Feb 26-08 14:47:12]Cenn <clergy> i wish summons werent so useless, theyd be kinda cool if our area attacks didnt hit them
[Mar 12-08 9:56:17]Rakonk <clergy> nul, you ever hook up monks with a new abil or something like that in the past?
[Mar 12-08 9:57:7]Rakonk <clergy> ahh kk
[Mar 13-08 20:37:58]Fenix <clergy> thief was too much for me
[Mar 13-08 20:38:22]Fenix <clergy> hows it going Nul?
[Mar 13-08 20:40:4]Fenix <clergy> oh yeah got to watch the new south park eposide
[Mar 13-08 20:40:40]Fenix <clergy> still have to watch it lol
[Mar 13-08 20:43:22]Fenix <clergy> yup
[Mar 13-08 20:44:36]Fenix <clergy> i will
[Mar 13-08 20:45:20]Fenix <clergy> i just think that the skills are a little too expensive
[Mar 13-08 20:46:24]Fenix <clergy> what esle is left to add to thief?
[Mar 13-08 20:48:44]Fenix <clergy> ooo nice
[Mar 13-08 20:48:56]Fenix <clergy> how long proably?
[Mar 13-08 20:49:36]Fenix <clergy> like a month or so to finish thief then
[Mar 14-08 18:47:35]Fenix <clergy> monks are pretty good
[Mar 14-08 18:47:43]Nenet <clergy> they are?
[Mar 14-08 18:47:57]Fenix <clergy> they're ok
[Mar 14-08 18:48:13]Fenix <clergy> this lvl restrictions aren't cool
[Mar 14-08 18:48:27]Fenix <clergy> killing my whole do skills every 5 lvls
[Mar 22-08 14:33:9]Knuckle <clergy> why do i get less xp if my summon lands the killing blow?
[Mar 22-08 15:28:55]Knuckle <clergy> any new summons coming up?
[Mar 22-08 15:29:41]Knuckle <clergy> ah kewl
[Mar 22-08 15:30:11]Knuckle <clergy> cause the summons i noticed i get at lvl 10 and they become completely pointless by 20
[Mar 22-08 16:31:32]Knuckle <clergy> what do i need to train for darkshift and dakzhul?
[Mar 22-08 16:32:23]Knuckle <clergy> k i guess ill have to find out the hard way :P
[Mar 22-08 16:33:20]Knuckle <clergy> nod
[Mar 22-08 16:38:19]Knuckle <clergy> hope i dont need perception for those 2
[Mar 24-08 23:51:37]Skrymer <clergy> now all we need is a monkey
[Mar 24-08 23:51:57]Paranoia <clergy> and a tranpoline!
[Mar 24-08 23:52:7]Paranoia <clergy> tramp*
[Mar 24-08 23:53:33]Skrymer <clergy> yep a tramp
[Mar 24-08 23:53:37]Skrymer <clergy> :P
[Mar 24-08 23:53:41]Paranoia <clergy> hehe
[Apr 13-08 18:8:5]Hinata <clergy> hrmm
[Apr 13-08 18:8:27]Hinata <clergy> wish melee would use dw, since i have 2 hands i could do 2 hits per round
[Apr 13-08 18:10:5]Hinata <clergy> like how other classes have 2 weapons they wield and they have weapon class, maybe supplication could add another round for us monks
[Apr 25-08 14:48:38]Cenn <clergy> nulvect, are you able to say if stats affect area attacks at all
[Apr 25-08 14:48:54]Cenn <clergy> tia told me that wisdom would make my spells stronegr and cost less, but others told me that int/wis are just for mana for area spells
[Apr 25-08 14:49:18]Cenn <clergy> the amount of damage done by the spell too?
[Apr 25-08 14:49:52]Cenn <clergy> so if its not listed under faith in "spells" such as demonfire, it wont be affected by wisdom?
[Apr 25-08 14:50:4]Cenn <clergy> cause i still needed to improve faith to get demofnire
[Apr 25-08 14:50:34]Nulvect <clergy> that's not how I meant it, I mean faith as in spells granted by a deity or relating to alignment
[Apr 25-08 14:50:40]Cenn <clergy> ahh
[Apr 25-08 14:52:42]Cenn <clergy> thanks
[Apr 25-08 14:52:48]<clergy> Nulvect nods
[Apr 25-08 14:52:58]Cenn <clergy> i wonder how much.. i put wisdom up 10 and used to 2 round 25ks but still dont 2 round 26ks :P
[Apr 25-08 14:53:38]Nulvect <clergy> spells are more skill based than physical attacks, but stats do come into play
[Apr 25-08 14:53:56]Cenn <clergy> i wish stats played more of a roll
[Apr 25-08 14:53:58]Cenn <clergy> i'd rather stat then level hehe
[Apr 25-08 14:54:18]Nulvect <clergy> you have a pretty good array of physical attacks at your disposal
[Apr 25-08 14:54:36]Cenn <clergy> but exping is arguably much faster with spells
[Apr 25-08 14:57:32]Cenn <clergy> wow just put 12mil into projectile to get it from 100 to 214 :p
[Apr 25-08 14:58:6]Cenn <clergy> and bloodlance sucks and skewer misses on sewer wyrms :P
[Apr 25-08 15:14:18]Cenn <clergy> daklihn istn bad
[Apr 25-08 15:14:32]Nulvect <clergy> good good
[Apr 25-08 15:14:44]Cenn <clergy> i dunno if i got it by improving strength or attack but :P
[Apr 25-08 15:15:14]Cenn <clergy> i was just !#!!## off cause i dumped 12mil into projectile to get it from 100 to 216 and all i got was bloodlance and skewer which both suck major haha
[Apr 25-08 15:15:26]Cenn <clergy> dakhlin is better than shadowburst though which i think is my best 1v1
[Apr 25-08 15:15:40]Nulvect <clergy> they don't suck, you just don't know how to use them
[Apr 25-08 15:15:44]Cenn <clergy> :(
[Apr 25-08 15:15:54]Cenn <clergy> ill learn after a cig :P brb
[Apr 25-08 15:24:50]Cenn <clergy> i don't see how you'd use them right :P  bloodlance seems like it would be good if it could be stacked with another attack but
[Apr 26-08 15:7:45]Cenn <clergy> Nulvect, it seems like it's a bug that even if Demonfire kills a monster, it doesn't actually die until the next round, is this fixable?
[Apr 26-08 15:8:7]Cenn <clergy> Mainly asking because it seems as if I waste a lot of mana on mobs that die in my demonfire, but then I hellfire them again anyways.
[May 1-08 15:20:6]Algren <clergy> test
[May 4-08 16:45:1]Kelsey <clergy> is there any way to refill mp, other than drinking from the fountain
[May 4-08 16:45:7]Cenn <clergy> stones
[May 4-08 17:29:11]Kelsey <clergy> what cleric spells depend on belief
[May 18-08 12:22:21]Cenn <clergy> i think bloodlance should para more often
[May 18-08 12:22:53]Cenn <clergy> like 40% of the time para 2 rounds
[May 24-08 13:49:4]Algren <clergy> Monk FTW
[Jun 1-08 13:10:27]Nulvect <clergy> not another one :P

[Jun 14-08 0:19:0]Bonnie <clergy> you want some buffs fellow druid?
[Jun 14-08 0:19:12]Cowl <clergy> sure :)
[Jun 14-08 0:19:18]Bonnie <clergy> can you come to lodos?
[Jun 14-08 0:29:36]Bonnie <clergy> enjoyfinger
[Jun 18-08 22:30:13]Yun <clergy> hey Nul when you do circlekick it just seems repetative
[Jun 18-08 22:31:19]Yun <clergy> whatcha thing
[Jun 18-08 22:31:23]Yun <clergy> think even
[Jun 20-08 22:20:59]Bonnie <clergy> Hey there Nulvect, what did ya think of my post on druid board?
[Jun 20-08 22:21:39]Bonnie <clergy> not really what you had in mind for druids?
[Jun 20-08 22:22:3]Nulvect <clergy> totem type things I'm saving for a sub that has yet to be made
[Jun 20-08 22:22:15]Bonnie <clergy> oh neat
[Jun 20-08 22:23:45]Bonnie <clergy> did you have anything in mind for druids?
[Jun 20-08 22:23:57]Nulvect <clergy> tons actually
[Jun 20-08 22:24:29]Bonnie <clergy> oh, just so you know. Morph is great wasnt paying it out or nothing
[Jun 20-08 22:25:21]Bonnie <clergy> it was just hard to make the change when I had spent the last levels making a character to support a party
[Jun 20-08 22:25:29]Nulvect <clergy> nod, I know
[Jun 20-08 22:25:35]Bonnie <clergy> nods cool cool
[Jun 20-08 22:25:43]Nulvect <clergy> give me a couple mins and I'll make up a post with my future plans for druids
[Jun 20-08 22:25:49]Bonnie <clergy> every one loves what you have done with Buffs,
[Jun 20-08 22:25:57]Bonnie <clergy> you got it
[Jun 20-08 22:26:13]Nulvect <clergy> I've done almost nothing with druids, that was daboura
[Jun 20-08 22:26:21]Bonnie <clergy> oh
[Jun 20-08 22:26:33]Bonnie <clergy> well, people like the buffs any hoo
[Jun 20-08 22:27:15]Nulvect <clergy> that's good, I plan to keep them
[Jun 20-08 22:27:53]Bonnie <clergy> nods, to be honst, i really enjoy playing the support roll. I think it adds another edge to gaming
[Jun 20-08 22:28:3]Bonnie <clergy> well, the mud really.
[Jun 20-08 22:29:27]Bonnie <clergy> humm.. i guess i answerd my own question then really didnt i. If i have spent all my time learning how to make others stronger, i probly wouldnt have spent much time on my self, hence I would be slower then others when acting alone
[Jun 20-08 22:31:25]Bonnie <clergy> oh one more thing, if your still there
[Jun 20-08 22:32:3]Bonnie <clergy> I have been using swipe, trying to work out best ways to xp with moprh and it takes 100sp
[Jun 20-08 22:32:21]Bonnie <clergy> is that right?
[Jun 20-08 22:34:19]Nulvect <clergy> probably a bit high, I'll take a look at it
[Jun 20-08 22:34:29]Bonnie <clergy> thanks :)
[Jun 20-08 22:42:23]Nulvect <clergy> posted
[Jun 20-08 22:42:35]Bonnie <clergy> neat. ill go check it out now :)
[Jun 20-08 22:44:25]Bonnie <clergy> will buffs change with season? or stay same through out?
[Jun 20-08 22:46:7]Bonnie <clergy> sounds cool to me :)
[Jun 22-08 15:47:16]Halucoost <clergy> exactly what do you xp with at level 1?
[Jun 22-08 15:47:24]Geddoe <clergy> pain

[Jun 23-08 16:16:5]Geddoe <clergy> levin is actually probably the best for a cleric
[Jun 23-08 16:16:17]Geddoe <clergy> its based on faith not ma, or atleast not much
[Jun 23-08 16:16:33]Halucoost <clergy> where do i check my mail? yeah I thought so

[Jun 23-08 16:18:17]Halucoost <clergy> thats pretty good
[Jun 23-08 16:18:27]Geddoe <clergy> wis helps damage but i think it mainly determines if it deflects or not
[Jun 23-08 16:18:47]Geddoe <clergy> how is cleric workin for you?
[Jun 23-08 16:18:57]Halucoost <clergy> havent played much

[Jun 23-08 16:19:57]Halucoost <clergy> why not use whip?
[Jun 23-08 16:20:3]Geddoe <clergy> whip works aswell
[Jun 23-08 16:20:19]Geddoe <clergy> i like bash cause theres a chance to phaze them, but its not likely

[Jun 23-08 16:21:45]Halucoost <clergy> what ya mean by that?

[Jul 8-08 22:10:13]Halucoost <clergy> wanna know something I find weird.... My align wasnt going down in lodos the whole time I cleared the first 2 towers.... Now that im on the third it goes down every kill
[Jul 8-08 22:10:31]Geddoe <clergy> because
[Jul 8-08 22:10:35]Geddoe <clergy> the paladins have a positive alignment
[Jul 8-08 22:10:39]Geddoe <clergy> and the knights
[Jul 8-08 22:10:47]Geddoe <clergy> the tower guards/soldiers are neutral
[Jul 9-08 0:1:11]Bonnie <clergy> Nulect

[Jul 9-08 0:1:47]Geddoe <clergy> sweet
[Jul 9-08 0:2:13]Nulvect <clergy> I dunno, I was thinking of perhaps having different abilities based on class
[Jul 9-08 0:2:23]Bonnie <clergy> I was xping with Amaki last night and we were trying out "mount allow <name>" while in bear moph it said that it was allowing Amaki to mount but he couldnt? was it even possable?
[Jul 9-08 0:2:25]Geddoe <clergy> ok maybe not holyfire
[Jul 9-08 0:2:33]Geddoe <clergy> but some kind of area-elite angel move :P
[Jul 9-08 0:2:59]Geddoe <clergy> since clerics already have an area-heal
[Jul 9-08 0:2:59]Nulvect <clergy> hmm, mount allow works for anyone but you can't ride just anyone

[Aug 20-08 13:54:7]Tai <clergy> hehe hope fear gets better soon
[Aug 20-08 19:58:6]Tai <clergy> so darkmist pwns shadowburst?
[Sep 18-08 12:48:42]Nulvect <clergy> so I need to update some druid spells to put some fixes in...
[Sep 18-08 12:48:58]Uzamaki <clergy> ahhh, is that bad?
[Sep 18-08 12:49:28]Nulvect <clergy> well, it will allow you to recast all your buffs right after I do so
[Sep 18-08 12:49:42]Uzamaki <clergy> ok
[Sep 18-08 12:49:48]Nulvect <clergy> could you refrain from that and just recast them after they run out?? heh
[Sep 18-08 12:49:56]Uzamaki <clergy> but of course. :)
[Sep 18-08 12:50:10]Nulvect <clergy> it may or may not give messages when they do
[Sep 18-08 12:50:18]Nulvect <clergy> but my fixed way always will
[Sep 18-08 12:50:44]Nulvect <clergy> heh, they last so long that the spell was getting cleaned out of memory before they wore off, so you sometimes didn't get the message
[Sep 18-08 12:51:2]Uzamaki <clergy> ahhhh
[Sep 18-08 12:51:30]Uzamaki <clergy> so you expanded the memory?
[Sep 18-08 12:51:50]Uzamaki <clergy> or shortened my spell? :)
[Sep 18-08 12:52:22]Nulvect <clergy> hmm, I sort of sent long-term control over to something else which shouldn't get cleaned up
[Sep 18-08 12:52:34]Uzamaki <clergy> ahhh, gotcha
[Sep 18-08 12:52:40]Uzamaki <clergy> so my spell will have same duration?
[Sep 18-08 12:52:50]Nulvect <clergy> yes, strength and durations are all the same as before
[Sep 18-08 12:53:6]Uzamaki <clergy> woohoo!
[Sep 18-08 12:53:14]Uzamaki <clergy> yer the man, nulvect!
[Sep 18-08 12:53:16]Nulvect <clergy> I actually completely rewrote resonate because I couldn't stand how it was written, so do check that out
[Sep 18-08 12:53:28]Uzamaki <clergy> ok
[Sep 18-08 12:53:36]Nulvect <clergy> when I get around to druids though the durations will probably go down a bit
[Sep 18-08 12:53:48]Uzamaki <clergy> awww. :(
[Sep 18-08 12:54:10]Nulvect <clergy> that'll be a bit though
[Sep 18-08 12:54:30]Nulvect <clergy> husk was included in the updates too
[Sep 18-08 12:56:54]Uzamaki <clergy> uh oh
[Sep 18-08 12:56:58]Nulvect <clergy> yay messed up already
[Sep 18-08 12:56:58]Uzamaki <clergy> my bear's broke.
[Sep 18-08 12:57:22]Uzamaki <clergy> all 3 busted.
[Sep 18-08 12:57:32]Nulvect <clergy> yep, one sec
[Sep 18-08 12:57:38]Uzamaki <clergy> feel free to throw a fox and an owl in there with resonates. :)
[Sep 18-08 12:57:40]Nulvect <clergy> woops heh
[Sep 18-08 12:57:50]Uzamaki <clergy> i mean, while yer in there
[Sep 18-08 12:57:58]Uzamaki <clergy> I take it line 143 is a booboo?
[Sep 18-08 12:58:8]Nulvect <clergy> try now
[Sep 18-08 12:58:18]Nulvect <clergy> I may do that later
[Sep 18-08 12:58:22]Nulvect <clergy> just fixing the problems right now
[Sep 18-08 12:58:34]Uzamaki <clergy> no one to use it on, in party wioth Cenn
[Sep 18-08 12:59:2]Nulvect <clergy> one sec
[Sep 18-08 12:59:48]Nulvect <clergy> try now
[Sep 18-08 13:0:54]Nulvect <clergy> ok, that worked, I'm off
[Sep 18-08 13:1:2]Uzamaki <clergy> seems to work fine. :) Only I couldnt cast em as part of my macro string, hadda do each one separate
[Sep 18-08 13:1:10]Uzamaki <clergy> not a big deal I guess
[Sep 18-08 13:1:44]Nulvect <clergy> hmm, may have been set up incorrectly before, but each should take a round to cast
[Sep 18-08 13:4:37]Uzamaki <clergy> so trying to cast any one buff, even if unable, should prevent any other spell possibly going through?
[Sep 18-08 13:5:9]Nulvect <clergy> the only one I changed was resonate, a successful cast should take up a round
[Sep 18-08 13:5:31]Uzamaki <clergy> hmmm
[Sep 18-08 13:5:35]Nulvect <clergy> failed cast should no
[Sep 18-08 13:5:43]Nulvect <clergy> not
[Sep 18-08 13:5:45]Uzamaki <clergy> it fails now?
[Sep 18-08 13:5:53]Uzamaki <clergy> I know whatcha mean, nvm
[Sep 18-08 13:9:29]Uzamaki <clergy> My buffs made him overconfident. :_(
[Sep 30-08 18:28:22]Skunk <clergy> when you get to monks nul, would you consider shortening the length of time inbetween focus uses, thanks
[Sep 30-08 18:29:58]Nulvect <clergy> maybe, it's not meant to be used continuously though
[Sep 30-08 18:30:8]<clergy> Skunk nods.
[Oct 26-08 21:36:26]Nulvect <clergy> I did adjust the skill gain from healing yourself... it was rather low before
[Oct 26-08 21:36:44]Nulvect <clergy> and I admittedly did not change heal or cure much
[Oct 26-08 21:36:48]Nulvect <clergy> when I did clerics that is
[Oct 26-08 21:37:0]Scoff <clergy> its good now, noticed the change in skill % gain
[Oct 26-08 21:37:12]Scoff <clergy> humm... well, like i said am only lvl10 but heal looks good
[Oct 26-08 21:37:36]Scoff <clergy> and the abilility to boost on three lvls of str is good
[Oct 26-08 21:38:18]Scoff <clergy> what was your plain for clerics?
[Oct 26-08 21:38:48]Nulvect <clergy> for them to be protectors and healers
[Oct 26-08 21:38:52]Scoff <clergy> nods
[Oct 26-08 21:39:0]Nulvect <clergy> all their attack spells are purposely limited
[Oct 26-08 21:39:4]Scoff <clergy> def spells and heals
[Oct 26-08 21:39:12]Nulvect <clergy> yep
[Oct 26-08 21:39:26]Scoff <clergy> nods sounds good i rekon
[Oct 26-08 21:40:24]Nulvect <clergy> they have more spells on the way eventually, need to get some stuff in behind the scenes first
[Oct 26-08 21:41:26]Scoff <clergy> ahh nods, i like that they have limited attack type spells. makes sence when they would have spent more time learning how to heal wounds and protect etc etc
[Oct 26-08 23:49:34]Scoff <clergy> woah...wound hammers the alignemend down
[Oct 26-08 23:49:48]Cenn <clergy> yeah, you gotta be really careful as angel where you kill too
[Oct 26-08 23:49:56]Cenn <clergy> only place in lodos is south tower, don't go to tenebrae at all
[Oct 26-08 23:50:2]Scoff <clergy> nods
[Oct 26-08 23:50:8]Cenn <clergy> if your alignment goes even the slightest bit below godly, it really messes up levin :/
[Oct 26-08 23:50:18]Scoff <clergy> dont have levin atm
[Oct 26-08 23:50:20]Cenn <clergy> nod
[Oct 26-08 23:50:36]Scoff <clergy> but pain dont effect alignemnt but wound does...
[Oct 26-08 23:50:38]Cenn <clergy> killing demons will get alignment back up fast but alignment being down makes you a lot weaker
[Oct 26-08 23:50:46]Cenn <clergy> yeah probably just an oversight
[Oct 26-08 23:51:6]Nulvect <clergy> nope, that's on purpose so they have at least one attack spell they can always use
[Oct 26-08 23:51:15]Scoff <clergy> phew
[Oct 26-08 23:52:3]Scoff <clergy> cant see my self useing wound at all then :S
[Oct 26-08 23:53:44]Cenn <clergy> yeah
[Oct 26-08 23:53:50]Cenn <clergy> once you hit 25 thogh levin is all youll use
[Oct 26-08 23:54:1]Scoff <clergy> yeah, thats what i figured
[Oct 26-08 23:54:21]Scoff <clergy> till i get in some ones range to boost and heal :P
[Oct 26-08 23:54:27]Cenn <clergy> nod
[Oct 26-08 23:54:59]Cenn <clergy> i actually use whirlwind sometimes cause its sometimes the same amount of rounds per mob as levin, and a LOT less mana, but most the time its levination
[Oct 26-08 23:55:21]Scoff <clergy> i dont have whirlwind :p
[Oct 26-08 23:56:25]Scoff <clergy> humm dispell seems kinda strgon
[Oct 26-08 23:56:29]Scoff <clergy> strong
[Oct 26-08 23:56:43]Scoff <clergy> well, better then pain anyways
[Oct 31-08 0:3:57]Scoff <clergy> did you check my post on the clergy board Nul?
[Oct 31-08 0:6:23]Nulvect <clergy> I seem to recall liking the idea but can't remember what it was at this moment, let me look again
[Oct 31-08 0:6:39]Nulvect <clergy> ah, yes
[Oct 31-08 0:6:39]Scoff <clergy> nods
[Oct 31-08 0:7:19]Scoff <clergy> I know you are cranking out hardwork on other classes, i was just wondering what your thoughts might be.
[Oct 31-08 0:9:19]Nulvect <clergy> I think it's a good idea
[Oct 31-08 0:9:53]Scoff <clergy> nods cool stuff :)
[Nov 14-08 16:12:49]Yun <clergy> man the one time i lreally need Skunk
[Dec 3-08 3:11:40]Tai <clergy> funny, in the help file for hellfire, it never actually states that its a faith spell... just a spell
[Dec 23-08 20:26:3]Hinata <clergy> would be cool if monks could actually get something from meditating
[Dec 28-08 5:25:32]Dom <clergy> sup.
[Dec 28-08 5:25:48]Hinata <clergy> hey there
[Dec 28-08 14:47:23]Hinata <clergy> i have 11 int and 2 wis i get 224 mp but i have 15 dex i only get 135 sp... dont get it
[Dec 28-08 14:48:23]Uzamaki <clergy> Clergy are mostly mp-based, so those will be lots higher than our physical abilities, like dex and str and con
[Dec 28-08 14:48:27]Dom <clergy> mp boost for clergy?
[Dec 28-08 14:48:45]Dom <clergy> uza got some advice for xping a druid
[Dec 28-08 14:49:9]Hinata <clergy> ok.. i can see that, thx Uza
[Dec 28-08 14:49:21]Uzamaki <clergy> Wisdom is very important and just stay grinding. Partying is a big plus if you can get it too
[Dec 28-08 14:49:46]Dom <clergy> is angel worth it
[Dec 28-08 14:49:56]Dom <clergy> i might jump to 50 and try and figure it out
[Dec 28-08 14:50:2]Hinata <clergy> angel is pretty nice
[Dec 28-08 14:51:34]Uzamaki <clergy> angel is definitely worth it. My best sdruid spell is whirlwind. My levin hits for 3x a whirlwind.
[Dec 28-08 14:52:32]Dom <clergy> meh i dont have the paitence to xp one :P
[Dec 28-08 14:55:36]Uzamaki <clergy> to each, their own
[Dec 28-08 14:55:46]Dom <clergy> true
[Jan 3-09 2:18:2]Tai <clergy> man my warrior xps faster then this... hehe
[Jan 5-09 22:45:2]Brialar <clergy> Welcome
[Jan 5-09 22:45:6]Dantes <clergy> thank you
[Jan 6-09 0:22:26]Sek <clergy> what is the druid alignment suposed to be at ?
[Jan 23-09 23:5:31]Jeslesk <clergy> hehe
[Jan 23-09 23:5:39]Jeslesk <clergy> yeah i just started one
[Jan 23-09 23:5:51]Dantes <clergy> i guess they will get changed eventually which si the only down side
[Jan 23-09 23:18:27]Jeslesk <clergy> is absorb based off've faith maybe?
[Jan 23-09 23:18:35]Dantes <clergy> either than or magic attack
[Jan 23-09 23:18:35]Geddoe <clergy> does it raise faith when you use it?
[Jan 23-09 23:18:45]Dantes <clergy> it seems to be capped at 50 tho
[Jan 23-09 23:19:1]Jeslesk <clergy> hm, i havn't checked that tks geddoe
[Jan 23-09 23:19:29]Geddoe <clergy> if the % goes up then yeah faith helps
[Jan 23-09 23:19:37]Jeslesk <clergy> nod cool i hadn't thought about that
[Jan 23-09 23:19:47]Geddoe <clergy> but if I had to choose one, magic attack would be the guess
[Jan 23-09 23:20:11]Dantes <clergy> i'd recommend leveling to 15 for summon assassin. that's like cheating its so strong for lvl 15 :P
[Jan 23-09 23:20:21]Jeslesk <clergy> yeah?
[Jan 23-09 23:20:29]Jeslesk <clergy> maybe i'll do that
[Jan 23-09 23:20:33]Dantes <clergy> using it in combiation with your spells you can 2-3 round a 25k at lvl 15
[Jan 23-09 23:20:33]Jeslesk <clergy> looks cool :)
[Jan 23-09 23:20:39]Dantes <clergy> imp is good until then
[Jan 23-09 23:20:47]Dantes <clergy> kataan = cheating :P    at least so far
[Jan 23-09 23:21:9]Dantes <clergy> it'll be changed totally eventually tho i'm sure
[Jan 23-09 23:21:19]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 23-09 23:21:21]Geddoe <clergy> yeah they will be a mostly physical class soon
[Jan 23-09 23:21:31]Jeslesk <clergy> hm
[Jan 23-09 23:21:41]Mathius <clergy> lets see the mp cost
[Jan 23-09 23:21:43]Jeslesk <clergy> maybe imp wasn't so good of an idea then, i have no strength whatsoever :)
[Jan 23-09 23:21:47]Dantes <clergy> nod i'm not gonna make this guy very big cause of that. dont want tons of wis/int and then get changed to 90% physical lol
[Jan 23-09 23:22:19]Mathius <clergy> i just got bored with this guy
[Jan 23-09 23:22:33]Mathius <clergy> they are already a wonderful physical class though
[Jan 23-09 23:22:35]Mathius <clergy> pretty good abils
[Jan 23-09 23:22:53]Dantes <clergy> i want to check out demonfire and vortex mostly. just curious what playing a magic class is like
[Jan 23-09 23:23:5]Mathius <clergy> i dont ever use demonfire pve
[Jan 23-09 23:23:17]Dantes <clergy> gotta say its nice to be a class with magic defense so i dont need a million wis to resist casters in arena :P
[Jan 23-09 23:23:17]Mathius <clergy> it just takes extra time to kill and wastes mp
[Jan 23-09 23:23:29]Mathius <clergy> vortex is just godly
[Jan 23-09 23:23:33]Dantes <clergy> sweet
[Jan 23-09 23:23:37]Dantes <clergy> arena?
[Jan 23-09 23:23:41]Mathius <clergy> but like i said, massive mp cost
[Jan 23-09 23:23:53]Mathius <clergy> i partied with rohl a couple times, one vortex in a 5mob room costed him about 2k mp
[Jan 23-09 23:23:55]Mathius <clergy> me?
[Jan 23-09 23:23:59]Dantes <clergy> owch
[Jan 23-09 23:24:1]Jeslesk <clergy> wow
[Jan 23-09 23:24:3]Dantes <clergy> yes please :-)
[Jan 23-09 23:24:21]Mathius <clergy> one hellfire for me right now, 1210 to 626
[Jan 23-09 23:24:23]Mathius <clergy> 5 mob room
[Jan 23-09 23:24:27]Mathius <clergy> half my mp
[Jan 23-09 23:24:31]Dantes <clergy> owch
[Jan 23-09 23:24:33]Jeslesk <clergy> !##! :)
[Jan 23-09 23:24:43]Dantes <clergy> i take about 400 for a 5 mob roob at my level
[Jan 23-09 23:24:45]Jeslesk <clergy> er dang
[Jan 23-09 23:24:49]Jeslesk <clergy> keep forgetting about that
[Jan 23-09 23:25:13]Mathius <clergy> and a second hellfire killed the 16k and weaker
[Jan 23-09 23:25:19]Dantes <clergy> lvl 35?
[Jan 23-09 23:25:21]Mathius <clergy> the 25k and 26k are near death
[Jan 23-09 23:25:23]Mathius <clergy> yeah
[Jan 23-09 23:25:35]Dantes <clergy> hmmm good killing speed on hellfire at that level
[Jan 23-09 23:25:41]Mathius <clergy> nod
[Jan 23-09 23:25:45]Mathius <clergy> low stats
[Jan 23-09 23:26:39]Dantes <clergy> cool. thanks
[Jan 23-09 23:28:31]Jeslesk <clergy> nod some of it is faith
[Jan 23-09 23:28:37]Jeslesk <clergy> % went up
[Jan 23-09 23:45:55]Jeslesk <clergy> kataans get any kindof portal situation?
[Jan 25-09 19:1:42]Jeslesk <clergy> sup dantes?
[Jan 25-09 19:1:48]Dantes <clergy> hey. hows it going
[Jan 25-09 19:2:6]Jeslesk <clergy> eating soup and a grilled cheese :)
[Jan 25-09 19:3:30]Jeslesk <clergy> how's ur kataan?
[Jan 25-09 19:3:38]Dantes <clergy> i'm enjoying it so far. how about you?
[Jan 25-09 19:3:44]Jeslesk <clergy> love it :)
[Jan 25-09 19:3:54]Jeslesk <clergy> really versatile
[Jan 25-09 19:4:2]Dantes <clergy> ya its nice to have so many options
[Jan 25-09 19:4:2]Jeslesk <clergy> (sp?)
[Jan 25-09 19:4:36]Jeslesk <clergy> hell if it wasn't for the fact that my imp has NO str i could even do melee somtimes hehe
[Jan 25-09 19:4:50]Dantes <clergy> hehe its hard to pick a good race for kataan
[Jan 25-09 19:4:54]Dantes <clergy> demon would be ideal
[Jan 25-09 19:5:0]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 25-09 19:5:10]<clergy> Jeslesk dosn't have the first clue to finding them
[Jan 25-09 19:5:26]Dantes <clergy> i dont know the quest either but i think i have a few ideas
[Jan 25-09 19:5:44]Jeslesk <clergy> start in hell? lol all i can think :)
[Jan 25-09 19:5:52]Dantes <clergy> i figure i'll play as i level to see if i want to bother playing enough to make it worth trying demon
[Jan 25-09 19:6:4]Jeslesk <clergy> like what happens when you become a quest race anyways? go back to 1?
[Jan 25-09 19:6:12]Dantes <clergy> i think so. and lose all stats
[Jan 25-09 19:6:32]Jeslesk <clergy> and you've got to be 50 1st before you can become one, right?
[Jan 25-09 19:6:36]Dantes <clergy> yup
[Jan 25-09 19:6:44]Jeslesk <clergy> wow harsh hehe
[Jan 25-09 19:6:56]Jeslesk <clergy> but yeah a demon would be kickass for kataan
[Jan 25-09 19:7:0]Dantes <clergy> some races are pretty easy to get to 50 fast
[Jan 25-09 19:7:18]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 25-09 19:7:40]Dantes <clergy> i think kataan could be pretty quick getting to 50
[Jan 25-09 19:8:10]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 25-09 19:8:58]Jeslesk <clergy> crap do you know where those ivory daggers are?
[Jan 25-09 19:9:4]Dantes <clergy> in merk
[Jan 25-09 19:9:8]Jeslesk <clergy> ahh k
[Jan 25-09 19:9:18]<clergy> Jeslesk spaces his set somewhere.
[Jan 25-09 19:10:12]Jeslesk <clergy> so what lvl u got dantes up to?
[Jan 25-09 19:10:24]Dantes <clergy> hanging out as a lvl 25 for the moment
[Jan 25-09 19:10:44]Jeslesk <clergy> nod, we get somthing good at 25 or somthing?
[Jan 25-09 19:10:50]Dantes <clergy> 20 we get hellfire
[Jan 25-09 19:10:54]Jeslesk <clergy> ahhh
[Jan 25-09 19:11:0]Jeslesk <clergy> bet that makes a hell of a difference :)
[Jan 25-09 19:11:2]Dantes <clergy> i think demonfire is next at 30 or so
[Jan 25-09 19:11:10]Dantes <clergy> hellfire is pretty fun
[Jan 25-09 19:11:16]Jeslesk <clergy> does it hit ur summon?
[Jan 25-09 19:11:22]Dantes <clergy> ya so no more assassin sadly
[Jan 25-09 19:11:28]Jeslesk <clergy> see
[Jan 25-09 19:11:30]Dantes <clergy> but its fast enough to be worth it
[Jan 25-09 19:11:34]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 25-09 19:11:50]Jeslesk <clergy> duno i'm gonna roll at lvl 19 for a bit and do stats with this guy
[Jan 25-09 19:11:58]Dantes <clergy> right on
[Jan 25-09 19:12:6]Dantes <clergy> 19 was fast too with assassin being so powerful
[Jan 25-09 19:12:30]Jeslesk <clergy> nodnod, i'm getting xp nearly as fast as i did w/ shathis :P
[Jan 25-09 19:12:36]Jeslesk <clergy> well, not quite but still it's fast
[Jan 25-09 19:12:56]Dantes <clergy> its definetly much much faster than assassin was up to this point
[Jan 25-09 19:13:6]Dantes <clergy> assassin got good around lvl 40 with 100 in all main stats
[Jan 25-09 19:13:58]Jeslesk <clergy> nod i was gonna try to get my wis int and dex to like 75 or 100 or so.. and i duno WHAT i'm gonna do about my con, but then move up from there
[Jan 25-09 19:14:30]Dantes <clergy> ya the con is worrying me too. even as elf it's painful
[Jan 25-09 19:14:44]Jeslesk <clergy> my 6 constitution that already costs 75k :)
[Jan 25-09 19:14:52]Dantes <clergy> i was going to stat up a bit but i'm kinda tempted to just power to 50 and go demon
[Jan 25-09 19:15:2]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 25-09 19:15:8]Dantes <clergy> i'm over 1 mil for con myself. it costs about double my int/wis
[Jan 25-09 19:15:20]Jeslesk <clergy> if i had the 1st clue about where to get a demon i prolly would
[Jan 25-09 19:15:36]Jeslesk <clergy> b/c with this imp i'll never be able to use any of my melee abilities or anything
[Jan 25-09 19:16:20]Jeslesk <clergy> ah well, i'll just be a caster kataan :)
[Jan 25-09 19:16:22]Dantes <clergy> its hard to use area attacks without good con too. i can barely use it in sewers 2
[Jan 25-09 19:16:32]Jeslesk <clergy> ouch
[Jan 25-09 19:16:34]Dantes <clergy> hehe same. i'm pure caster at the moment
[Jan 25-09 19:17:0]Jeslesk <clergy> but i figure if i can get int wis and dex up to like 75 or 100 or so before moving on i should be ok
[Jan 25-09 19:17:12]Jeslesk <clergy> hopefully :)
[Jan 25-09 19:17:26]Dantes <clergy> :)
[Jan 25-09 19:17:50]Jeslesk <clergy> hehe have a char that's only able to kill lower lvl stuff.  just REALLY fast.
[Jan 25-09 19:17:54]Jeslesk <clergy> :)
[Jan 25-09 19:18:10]Dantes <clergy> hehe that's how assassin is. it slaughters low level stuff but it really slow vs big monsters
[Jan 25-09 19:18:26]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 25-09 19:18:46]Jeslesk <clergy> wonder if wis makes your summons get better
[Jan 25-09 19:19:2]Dantes <clergy> my summon seemed to always be the same
[Jan 25-09 19:19:6]Jeslesk <clergy> hmm
[Jan 25-09 19:19:22]Dantes <clergy> i think kataans stop use summons after lvl 20
[Jan 25-09 19:19:30]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 25-09 19:19:34]Jeslesk <clergy> kindof a shame they're cool
[Jan 25-09 19:19:38]Dantes <clergy> ya
[Jan 25-09 19:28:10]Jeslesk <clergy> hmm. then again maybe i SHOULDN'T put all my effort into making this guy if kataans are going to be changed soon to more physical..
[Jan 25-09 19:28:16]Jeslesk <clergy> they're too fun though.. :)
[Jan 25-09 19:28:18]Dantes <clergy> hehe
[Jan 25-09 19:28:34]Jeslesk <clergy> guess if that happens i can always try to get to 50 and go demon
[Jan 25-09 19:28:40]Dantes <clergy> true
[Jan 25-09 19:28:46]Jeslesk <clergy> and would be able to skip to 50 prolly pretty quick when the time came
[Jan 25-09 19:29:12]Jeslesk <clergy> now i just gota do a mudwide search for demons... lol
[Jan 25-09 19:29:22]Dantes <clergy> hehe
[Jan 25-09 19:34:46]Jeslesk <clergy> man i tell you having absorb does really help out w/ the lack of con though wow. :)
[Jan 25-09 19:34:54]Dantes <clergy> hehe absorb is super nice
[Jan 25-09 19:35:58]Jeslesk <clergy> i been using it at my main attack spell alot of the time, hits just about as hard as my other stuff and i don't ever have to stop for oil
[Jan 26-09 17:59:52]Jeslesk <clergy> so how's that bastet working out for you?
[Jan 28-09 12:29:7]Dantes <clergy> going kataan?
[Jan 28-09 12:29:17]Pix <clergy> Yep
[Jan 28-09 12:29:25]Dantes <clergy> right on. we'll have lots of new kataans around here
[Jan 28-09 12:30:43]Dantes <clergy> half-elf would be a pretty good kataan race too
[Jan 28-09 12:30:53]Pix <clergy> You think so
[Jan 28-09 12:31:3]Dantes <clergy> anything with lots of con/int would work for my playstyle
[Jan 28-09 12:47:59]<clergy> Jeslesk has actually been doing quite a bit of melee
[Jan 28-09 12:48:5]Dantes <clergy> impale?
[Jan 28-09 12:48:7]Jeslesk <clergy> prolly just b/c i'm new to it
[Jan 28-09 12:48:9]Jeslesk <clergy> yeah
[Jan 28-09 12:48:21]Dantes <clergy> cool
[Jan 28-09 12:48:31]Dantes <clergy> i havent maxxed projectile to test how good it is for me
[Jan 28-09 12:48:33]Jeslesk <clergy> ill impale in battle till either my sp gets too low or hp starts going down, then switch to absorb :)
[Jan 28-09 12:48:39]Dantes <clergy> right on
[Jan 28-09 12:48:51]Jeslesk <clergy> havn't even done summon yet :)
[Jan 28-09 12:49:3]Jeslesk <clergy> but i'm sure it'll be much faster w/ an imp or assassin demon
[Jan 28-09 12:49:17]Dantes <clergy> those 2 summons are soooo fast for exping at those levels.
[Jan 28-09 12:49:23]Dantes <clergy> love how fast kataan moves up
[Jan 28-09 12:49:45]Dantes <clergy> 25-32 felt kinda slow for me, but it got better again as i raised stats
[Jan 28-09 12:51:33]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 28-09 12:51:49]Jeslesk <clergy> i'll prolly finish getting up to 19 and stop for a bit, max out skills do a few stats
[Jan 28-09 12:52:5]Jeslesk <clergy> but yeah at 14 without ANY summons my guy is much much stronger than when i was using my imp
[Jan 28-09 12:55:9]Jeslesk <clergy> oo i've got slice now too
[Jan 28-09 13:14:29]Jeslesk <clergy> u used slice much?
[Jan 28-09 13:14:37]Dantes <clergy> i dont have it yet. i havent raised weapon skills
[Jan 28-09 13:14:41]Dantes <clergy> i use pure hellfire
[Jan 28-09 13:14:55]Dantes <clergy> ozzy leveled with slice for a long time tho
[Jan 28-09 13:15:15]Dantes <clergy> backstab needs 50 dex or so before its worth using at all. until then i used slice
[Jan 28-09 13:15:35]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 28-09 13:42:21]Dantes <clergy> wow... demonfire is like cheating
[Jan 28-09 13:42:25]Jeslesk <clergy> hehe
[Jan 28-09 13:42:35]Pix <clergy> Cant wait
[Jan 28-09 13:42:45]Dantes <clergy> assassin at 15 really makes stuff fast
[Jan 28-09 13:48:37]Jeslesk <clergy> heh
[Jan 28-09 13:48:39]Dantes <clergy> heh
[Jan 28-09 13:48:55]<clergy> Jeslesk avoids the aoe rooms :)
[Jan 28-09 13:49:5]<clergy> Dantes avoids non-aoe rooms
[Jan 28-09 14:36:5]Jeslesk <clergy> hey dantes you in lodos?
[Jan 28-09 14:36:9]Dantes <clergy> just finished it
[Jan 28-09 14:36:15]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 28-09 14:36:15]Dantes <clergy> in sewers now
[Jan 28-09 14:36:21]Jeslesk <clergy> might go wait for some of it to repop
[Jan 28-09 14:36:27]Dantes <clergy> i dont do sewrs 1 so its all there
[Jan 28-09 14:36:33]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 28-09 14:37:1]Jeslesk <clergy> i mean maybe you shouldn't be so harsh
[Jan 28-09 14:37:11]Jeslesk <clergy> what's s1 ever done to you?
[Jan 28-09 14:37:15]Dantes <clergy> hehe
[Jan 28-09 14:37:21]Jeslesk <clergy> i mean there's no reason to be unreasonably biased like that
[Jan 28-09 14:37:49]Jeslesk <clergy> :)
[Jan 28-09 14:37:53]<clergy> Dantes smiles
[Jan 28-09 14:38:25]Pix <clergy> Clergy is getting weird
[Jan 28-09 14:38:45]Dantes <clergy> hehe kataan has a lot of stuff to it. physical/magical/summons
[Jan 28-09 14:38:53]Dantes <clergy> all overpowered :)
[Jan 28-09 17:48:0]Jeslesk <clergy> u in lodos dantes?
[Jan 28-09 17:48:16]Jeslesk <clergy> and/or cleared it out recently
[Jan 28-09 17:53:52]Dantes <clergy> havent hit lodos recently
[Jan 28-09 17:53:56]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 28-09 17:54:16]Quetzel <clergy> i forgot about this channel
[Jan 28-09 17:54:20]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 28-09 17:54:46]Jeslesk <clergy> actually gets some use these days
[Jan 29-09 17:2:51]Dantes <clergy> hows kataan life treating you?
[Jan 29-09 17:2:57]Jeslesk <clergy> good
[Jan 29-09 17:3:3]Jeslesk <clergy> real good
[Jan 29-09 17:3:19]Jeslesk <clergy> just got back to 19 finally and have skills near maxed
[Jan 29-09 17:3:33]Dantes <clergy> right on
[Jan 29-09 19:28:5]Dantes <clergy> ooo Nulvect is a kataan
[Jan 29-09 19:28:15]Jeslesk <clergy> i saw that
[Jan 29-09 19:28:21]Jeslesk <clergy> makes me nervous :)
[Jan 29-09 19:28:23]Dantes <clergy> wonder if we're being changed
[Jan 29-09 19:28:45]Nulvect <clergy> I was a kataan before I was an imm.. and kataans have already been changed a lot
[Jan 29-09 19:28:49]Dantes <clergy> the single best change that is needed for kataans is to tripple backstab damage
[Jan 29-09 19:28:55]Dantes <clergy> kataan is super fun :)
[Jan 29-09 19:29:5]Jeslesk <clergy> nod they're a fun class
[Jan 29-09 19:29:13]Dantes <clergy> love the versitility
[Jan 29-09 19:29:35]Dantes <clergy> should we expect big changes some time in the future for kataans? removal of AOE or anything like that?
[Jan 29-09 19:29:53]Nulvect <clergy> the only things I'm planning to change are summons
[Jan 29-09 19:29:59]Jeslesk <clergy> oo really?
[Jan 29-09 19:30:3]Dantes <clergy> sweet
[Jan 29-09 19:30:5]Jeslesk <clergy> what's ur plans for summons?
[Jan 29-09 19:30:19]Nulvect <clergy> to make them not suck
[Jan 29-09 19:30:23]Dantes <clergy> lol
[Jan 29-09 19:30:23]Jeslesk <clergy> sweet
[Jan 29-09 19:30:31]Jeslesk <clergy> actually they're pretty good and all
[Jan 29-09 19:30:35]Jeslesk <clergy> just when you get ur aoe u can't use them anymore
[Jan 29-09 19:30:41]Jeslesk <clergy> but otherwise i love em'
[Jan 29-09 19:31:45]Nulvect <clergy> the point is to have a tension between area spells and single attacks
[Jan 29-09 19:31:57]Jeslesk <clergy> nod
[Jan 29-09 19:32:11]Dantes <clergy> i definetly notice it now where i havent trained my physical half so i cant do much single target damage
[Jan 29-09 19:32:15]Jeslesk <clergy> like you mean to where you can do either really?
[Jan 29-09 19:32:21]<clergy> Nulvect nods
[Jan 29-09 19:32:27]Jeslesk <clergy> that'd be awsome
[Jan 29-09 19:32:33]Jeslesk <clergy> that way i could party w/ people somtimes
[Jan 29-09 19:32:41]Nulvect <clergy> when I played, the only physical stuff kataans had were impale and dakzhul
[Jan 29-09 19:32:57]<clergy> Dantes is in love with demonfire
[Jan 29-09 19:32:59]Jeslesk <clergy> but yeah, like if the summons or somthing somehow grew bigger according to wis or summon skill, etc
[Jan 29-09 19:33:9]Jeslesk <clergy> nod, i been playing actually mostly physical so far
[Jan 29-09 19:33:13]Jeslesk <clergy> it's fun
[Jan 29-09 19:33:27]Jeslesk <clergy> you can do physical damage or whatever, then like switch and use ur absorb spell it's neat
[Jan 29-09 19:34:7]Nulvect <clergy> yes, I plan for summons to get bigger, though the exact scaling has yet to be figured out
[Jan 29-09 19:34:17]Jeslesk <clergy> sweet
[Jan 29-09 19:34:37]Dantes <clergy> hmmm... i'll have to figure out if i want to try to become a demon then. if we're not losing AOEs in the future i might stick with kataan for a long time
[Jan 29-09 19:34:45]Jeslesk <clergy> like that was my only thing, there's not REALLY a summon class on here per say, at least not one where the summons improve
[Jan 29-09 19:34:57]Jeslesk <clergy> or keep up or whatever
[Jan 29-09 19:35:19]Jeslesk <clergy> awsome man that sounds like a cool idea, that's what i was actually saying to dantes earlier is i love having minions :)
[Jan 29-09 19:35:35]Nulvect <clergy> well, summoning is meant to add to your other stuff as a kataan, and it'll still be limited to 1 summon at a time
[Jan 29-09 19:35:47]Nulvect <clergy> necros will be the ones that fight primarily through their pets
[Jan 31-09 0:20:26]Yun <clergy> hrmm since thieves get xp for stealing maybe clerics should get xp for healing
[Jan 31-09 0:20:34]Vladmir <clergy> heh
[Jan 31-09 2:56:32]Yun <clergy> errr Nul this aint right
[Jan 31-09 2:56:54]Yun <clergy> sumthin wrong with heal
[Jan 31-09 18:37:54]Jeslesk <clergy> kataan's fun . :)
[Jan 31-09 18:38:2]Ayre <clergy> it is? good :)
[Jan 31-09 18:38:4]Vladmir <clergy> heh
[Jan 31-09 18:38:30]Skunk <clergy> heh, kataans are over rated
[Jan 31-09 18:38:36]Vladmir <clergy> nah
[Jan 31-09 18:38:42]Vladmir <clergy> not in the least
[Jan 31-09 18:38:46]Ayre <clergy> should i be something else?
[Jan 31-09 18:38:58]Skunk <clergy> monks rock
[Jan 31-09 18:39:14]Vladmir <clergy> monks are over rated
[Jan 31-09 18:39:18]Ayre <clergy> hehe
[Jan 31-09 18:39:28]Skunk <clergy> pshaw
[Jan 31-09 18:39:48]Ayre <clergy> druid then?
[Jan 31-09 18:39:54]Skunk <clergy> nah, druid sucks
[Jan 31-09 18:39:56]Jeslesk <clergy> druids seem fun
[Jan 31-09 18:39:56]Ayre <clergy> hmm
[Jan 31-09 18:40:2]Jeslesk <clergy> i like buffs :)
[Jan 31-09 18:40:6]Skunk <clergy> clerics are fun if you are an angel
[Feb 1-09 21:24:18]Jyngle <clergy> wow this was a mistake
[Feb 1-09 21:24:24]Jeslesk <clergy> whazzat?
[Feb 1-09 21:24:40]Jyngle <clergy> faerie druid... ouch
[Feb 1-09 21:24:52]Quetzel <clergy> yeah
[Feb 1-09 21:25:8]Quetzel <clergy> im giving it a shot
[Feb 1-09 21:25:24]Quetzel <clergy> doin better than i thought
[Feb 1-09 21:25:30]Jyngle <clergy> nod
[Feb 3-09 20:16:13]Dantes <clergy> projectile is getting expensive. 1 mil is about 6 points now
[Feb 3-09 20:16:25]Vladmir <clergy> your tellin me
[Feb 3-09 20:16:37]Skunk <clergy> heh, that's not bad for skills
[Feb 3-09 20:16:39]Vladmir <clergy> gettin about tired of raising magic attack too
[Feb 3-09 20:16:53]Dantes <clergy> ya ma/faith/summoning were all pretty pricy
[Feb 3-09 20:16:57]Vladmir <clergy> double wielding is cheap as hell though
[Feb 3-09 20:17:1]Dantes <clergy> although it beats having to do stupid agility
[Feb 3-09 20:17:1]Skunk <clergy> my mage is like 4 mil a point for defense
[Feb 3-09 20:17:13]Vladmir <clergy> yeah but projectile is a main skill
[Feb 3-09 20:17:35]Vladmir <clergy> i think atleast summoning should be the same as your melee
[Feb 3-09 20:17:35]Dantes <clergy> agility on assassin is the worst i've had so far. 10 mil per point and growing fast
[Feb 3-09 20:17:59]Vladmir <clergy> atleast one point in agility
[Feb 3-09 20:18:3]Vladmir <clergy> dodge is amazing
[Feb 3-09 20:18:7]Dantes <clergy> love dodge
[Feb 3-09 20:18:9]Vladmir <clergy> one point in agility helps alot*
[Feb 3-09 20:18:23]Dantes <clergy> 5 agility = 1 dex for damage. or thereabouts
[Feb 3-09 20:18:45]Dantes <clergy> so 50 mil for the equivalent damage of 1 dex. thats about right
[Feb 6-09 13:4:44]Quetzel <clergy> do druids have alignment specific spells?
[Feb 6-09 13:5:28]Quetzel <clergy> or is it due to me being a faerie:)
[Feb 6-09 13:7:50]Dantes <clergy> i dont know druids too well. not sure about the alignemnt requirements
[Feb 6-09 23:17:35]Quetzel <clergy> hey is whirlwind alinment spefic?
[Feb 6-09 23:17:57]Quetzel <clergy> my alignment hasnt changed but the spell comes and goes
[Feb 6-09 23:18:27]Uzamaki <clergy> nope
[Feb 6-09 23:18:37]Uzamaki <clergy> what lvl?
[Feb 6-09 23:18:55]Uzamaki <clergy> use tells if u like
[Feb 6-09 23:19:53]Quetzel <clergy> thanks
[Feb 11-09 11:6:37]Nulvect <clergy> pix, my assassin wields his dagger just fine...
[Feb 11-09 11:7:5]Nulvect <clergy> and does whatever I command him to do
[Feb 11-09 11:7:57]Pix <clergy> Hmm let me try
[Feb 11-09 11:9:33]Pix <clergy> Ok he is wielding now but I guess command assassin to stab monster doesnt work you have to type the name of monster now
[Feb 11-09 11:12:49]Nulvect <clergy> oh, woops, that would be my fault
[Feb 11-09 11:15:13]Nulvect <clergy> well, despite the old ones being "monster", I took it out of them now, any further demons will not be "monster"
[Feb 11-09 11:15:27]Pix <clergy> Ok
[Feb 11-09 11:16:9]Pix <clergy> thanks for all your help
[Feb 11-09 11:16:43]Nulvect <clergy> no prob

[Feb 25-09 22:51:58]Morcerf <clergy> hehe that too
[Feb 25-09 22:52:0]Morcerf <clergy> Muay thai
[Feb 25-09 22:52:54]Morcerf <clergy> nothing like kicking and kneeing things after a long day at work :P
[Feb 25-09 22:53:8]Brialar <clergy> Hehe
[Mar 5-09 17:44:34]Yun <clergy> hey i thought heal gave you xp
[Mar 5-09 20:58:10]Yun <clergy> NUL just the guy i wanted to talk to
[Mar 5-09 20:58:56]Yun <clergy> so does using heal really give you xp?
[Mar 5-09 21:0:6]Nulvect <clergy> um, I think I added that yeah
[Mar 5-09 21:0:28]Yun <clergy> oo sorry not seeing an xp increase when i use it
[Mar 5-09 21:0:40]Nulvect <clergy> well healing yourself doesn't count
[Mar 5-09 21:0:44]Yun <clergy> aww ok
[Mar 5-09 21:2:2]Yun <clergy> oo ok i gots it now
[Mar 13-09 0:36:51]Draven <clergy> wtb icestorm :P
[Mar 13-09 0:37:3]Bonnie <clergy> want to buy an elite spell for druid
[Mar 13-09 0:37:15]Draven <clergy> oh icestorm was taken out entirely
[Mar 13-09 0:37:23]Bonnie <clergy> willing to trade morph for elite spell
[Mar 13-09 0:37:25]Draven <clergy> ok fine make icestorm a lvl 50 upgraded aoe :P
[Mar 13-09 0:38:19]Morta <clergy> :p
[Mar 13-09 0:38:23]Morta <clergy> thatd be amazin :p
[Mar 13-09 0:38:23]Draven <clergy> those buffs lasted a long haul
[Mar 13-09 0:38:25]Bonnie <clergy> at elite you should be able to choose one of two paths, path of the spirit or path of the beast :P one is a morph path the other is a spell casting path :p
[Mar 13-09 0:38:27]Draven <clergy> shouldnt server be rebooting
[Mar 13-09 0:38:27]Morta <clergy> word
[Mar 13-09 0:38:39]Morta <clergy> good idea :p
[Mar 13-09 0:38:52]Cowl <clergy> I agree with Bonnie
[Mar 13-09 0:38:52]Nulvect <clergy> it can take a minute for reboot to start
[Mar 13-09 0:39:1]Morta <clergy> ah
[Mar 13-09 0:39:15]Draven <clergy> well u should be able to use both depending on ur stats maybe..
[Mar 13-09 0:39:41]Draven <clergy> but switching may have a temporary sacrifice of some sort
[Mar 13-09 0:39:43]Bonnie <clergy> yeah, but i spent all my dam time gette up some good buffs dammt i have been punished for it at elite by getten morph lol
[Mar 13-09 0:39:47]Draven <clergy> i dunno im burnt out on idaes :p
[Mar 13-09 0:39:49]Morta <clergy> idk i just got a buck 20 in wis
[Mar 13-09 0:40:3]Morta <clergy> and pumped int for long buffs then did str\dex to where buffs made it 100
[Mar 13-09 0:40:15]Morta <clergy> wasnt so bad
[Mar 13-09 0:40:25]Morta <clergy> be nice if a bear could boost tho :p
[Mar 13-09 0:40:25]Bonnie <clergy> mm.. i got 100 str buffed
[Mar 13-09 0:40:39]Bonnie <clergy> i still prefer casting
[Mar 13-09 0:40:43]Draven <clergy> there was talk about druids getting a boost
[Mar 13-09 0:40:45]Morta <clergy> oh yea i did too
[Mar 13-09 0:40:49]Bonnie <clergy> if i wanted a fighter id make a warrior
[Mar 13-09 0:40:53]Nulvect <clergy> druids will probably be on the voting list after this round of changes, they'll get changes then
[Mar 13-09 0:40:53]Morta <clergy> i just liked walkin around as a wolf or bear
[Mar 13-09 0:41:9]Morta <clergy> dont change buffs :(
[Mar 13-09 0:41:21]Nulvect <clergy> they will be tweaked :P
[Mar 13-09 0:41:25]Morta <clergy> i had uhm daboura i think fix that bear resonate bug
[Mar 13-09 0:41:29]Morta <clergy> :P
[Mar 13-09 0:41:37]Draven <clergy> i dont like the sound of that :P
[Mar 13-09 0:41:39]Morta <clergy> was really cheap...
[Mar 13-09 0:41:49]Morta <clergy> he coulda said nerfed :p
[Mar 13-09 0:41:51]Draven <clergy> swear im always playing a class when they are on the downgrade :P
[Mar 13-09 0:41:55]Cowl <clergy> just so long as stuff is stat based :D
[Mar 13-09 0:42:11]Morta <clergy> isnt tweaked = good
[Mar 13-09 0:42:21]Draven <clergy> can go either way
[Mar 13-09 0:42:33]Morta <clergy> man why u gotta say tweak then nulvect :P
[Mar 13-09 0:42:35]Draven <clergy> so sad to see all these heads and paws go away
[Mar 13-09 0:42:41]Morta <clergy> haha
[Mar 13-09 0:42:45]Draven <clergy> cause thats what they need
[Mar 13-09 0:42:57]Nulvect <clergy> I'll probably make the time shorter and put a cap on how much you can give relative to the target
[Mar 13-09 0:42:59]Draven <clergy> some tweaking and maybe a lvl 50 caster type thing
[Mar 13-09 0:43:15]Draven <clergy> boost too :P
[Mar 13-09 0:43:17]Morta <clergy> i think u should make thorns a little better :\
[Mar 13-09 0:43:19]Cowl <clergy> so you cant go buffing level 10s +60 stats?
[Mar 13-09 0:43:19]Nulvect <clergy> it's ridiculous when an elite druid quadruples a newbie's stats and it lasts for half an hour or more
[Mar 13-09 0:43:21]Morta <clergy> for low lvl druids
[Mar 13-09 0:43:29]Morta <clergy> this is true
[Mar 13-09 0:43:31]Cowl <clergy> yea I agree there
[Mar 13-09 0:43:35]Bonnie <clergy> yeah, i can agree with you ont hat nul
[Mar 13-09 0:43:39]Morta <clergy> i always thought there should be a certain lvl to get buffs
[Mar 13-09 0:43:41]Nulvect <clergy> yeah I have tons of ideas in mind for druids
[Mar 13-09 0:43:59]Draven <clergy> cool
[Mar 13-09 0:44:9]Bonnie <clergy> are any classes done?
[Mar 13-09 0:44:23]Nulvect <clergy> hmm, I don't really consider anyone to be 'done' yet
[Mar 13-09 0:44:31]Bonnie <clergy> ahh
[Mar 13-09 0:44:37]Morta <clergy> somethin always needs "tweaked"
[Mar 13-09 0:44:37]Nulvect <clergy> berserkers and thieves would probably be the closest
[Mar 13-09 0:44:45]Bonnie <clergy> nods
[Mar 13-09 1:40:32]Draven <clergy> its like drinking an energy drink in game :p
[Mar 22-09 15:54:11]Panku <clergy> hey, did you kill kisada?
[Mar 22-09 15:54:29]Panku <clergy> cause I was afk , not sure how it happened
[Mar 27-09 6:7:59]Draven <clergy> .     ,   ,                                   ,   ,                                                                                .    /(   )\                                 /(   )\                                                                                .    \ \_/ /   , /\ ,                        \ \_/ /   , /\ , .    /_   _\  /| || |\                       /_   _\  /| || |\                                                                                  .   | \> </ | |\_||_/|                      | \> </ | |\_||_/|                                                                                .

[Mar 31-09 19:25:13]Nulvect <clergy> sorry druids... your buffs will still be good, but this is just ridiculous :P
[Mar 31-09 19:25:51]Uzamaki <clergy> awww
[Mar 31-09 19:25:59]Uzamaki <clergy> I did work pretty hard to get these tho
[Mar 31-09 19:26:11]Uzamaki <clergy> and I dont see druids on yer list yet, hehehe
[Mar 31-09 19:26:27]Nulvect <clergy> that's cause they got completely redone by dab shortly before I started on balance
[Mar 31-09 19:26:29]<clergy> Uzamaki will be glad to go after sorcerors tho
[Mar 31-09 19:26:41]Nulvect <clergy> after sorc I'll hold another vote
[Mar 31-09 19:26:49]Uzamaki <clergy> sounds good!
[Apr 1-09 1:52:34]Uzamaki <clergy> Nulvect? How are they changing?
[Apr 1-09 1:53:0]Nulvect <clergy> capped depending on the target, last slightly less time, cost may change a little
[Apr 1-09 1:53:12]Uzamaki <clergy> ahhh
[Apr 1-09 2:0:0]Nulvect <clergy> doh, what am I going to do with resonate then... hmmm
[Apr 1-09 2:1:28]Nulvect <clergy> ah well, will figure it out tomorrow
[Apr 1-09 2:2:50]Uzamaki <clergy> dbl it? :D
[Apr 1-09 16:53:4]Nulvect <clergy> new buffs will be going in soon, starting with bearsrage
[Apr 1-09 16:53:18]Uzamaki <clergy> hrmmm...
[Apr 1-09 16:53:24]Uzamaki <clergy> before reboot?
[Apr 1-09 16:53:30]Nulvect <clergy> yes
[Apr 1-09 16:53:34]Uzamaki <clergy> ahh
[Apr 1-09 16:53:54]Nulvect <clergy> it's copied over, but you're using the old one so I didn't update the spell just yet... it'll auto-update if you go a while without using it
[Apr 1-09 16:54:4]Uzamaki <clergy> ok
[Apr 1-09 16:54:18]Uzamaki <clergy> would quitting out and coming back reset it?
[Apr 1-09 16:54:28]Nulvect <clergy> sure, if you wanna do that I can just update it now
[Apr 1-09 16:54:34]Uzamaki <clergy> go for it. :)
[Apr 1-09 16:54:38]Nulvect <clergy> ok
[Apr 1-09 16:55:22]Nulvect <clergy> k, new bearsrage is in, the amounts should still be the same in most cases
[Apr 1-09 16:55:28]Uzamaki <clergy> k
[Apr 1-09 16:55:44]Nulvect <clergy> I'll be gone for an hour or so, let me know if anything happens with it
[Apr 1-09 16:55:50]Uzamaki <clergy> k
[Apr 1-09 18:11:53]Nulvect <clergy> any comments on bearsrage??
[Apr 1-09 18:14:11]Uzamaki <clergy> well, seems the same for myself, with a slight change in duration
[Apr 1-09 18:14:31]Uzamaki <clergy> only target other than myself was Seul, and I see it's been scaled down some for him
[Apr 1-09 18:15:1]Uzamaki <clergy> I think it's good. :) Wish I had some more folks unidle ta test on, but I will in time and give ya more feedback then. :)
[Apr 1-09 18:15:11]Nulvect <clergy> alright.. well that's what I was aiming for
[Apr 1-09 18:15:21]<clergy> Uzamaki could tell. :)
[Apr 1-09 18:15:47]Nulvect <clergy> I'll go ahead and get the rest in then
[Apr 1-09 18:22:39]Uzamaki <clergy> oh, Nulvect. One thing I noticed
[Apr 1-09 18:22:49]Uzamaki <clergy> no delay when i cast bearsrage
[Apr 1-09 18:22:53]Uzamaki <clergy> so I dbl buff
[Apr 1-09 18:23:2]Uzamaki <clergy> cast 2 that same round
[Apr 1-09 18:23:5]Uzamaki <clergy> like vinearmour
[Apr 1-09 18:23:31]Nulvect <clergy> k, that's probably an issue with vinearmour and your other spells, I'll fix it up
[Apr 1-09 18:23:45]Uzamaki <clergy> k
[Apr 1-09 18:48:50]Nulvect <clergy> I assume you druids are using your buffs.. they will be updated after they have gone unused for a while
[Apr 1-09 18:49:10]Brialar <clergy> Buffs are a must
[Apr 1-09 18:49:20]Brialar <clergy> We always use our buffs
[Apr 1-09 18:49:30]<clergy> Nulvect nods
[Apr 1-09 18:49:42]Brialar <clergy> But we changed our mind about killing you.
[Apr 1-09 18:49:50]Nulvect <clergy> ah, well that's good
[Apr 1-09 18:49:50]Uzamaki <clergy> we must...we must...we must increase our buffs!
[Apr 1-09 18:49:58]Nulvect <clergy> haha..
[Apr 1-09 18:50:0]Brialar <clergy> lol
[Apr 1-09 18:50:34]Brialar <clergy> Hey Uza what is the cheat code for God mode here again?
[Apr 1-09 18:50:38]Uzamaki <clergy> Hey Nul?
[Apr 1-09 18:50:54]Uzamaki <clergy> up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, start
[Apr 1-09 18:51:2]Brialar <clergy> Cool thx
[Apr 1-09 18:51:30]Uzamaki <clergy> could buffs be at the same scale all the way up? *winks*
[Apr 1-09 18:51:46]Nulvect <clergy> what do you mean??
[Apr 1-09 18:52:52]Uzamaki <clergy> from my calculations, bearsrage gives 1.5x the stat up to its present limit as well as I can tell
[Apr 1-09 18:53:12]Uzamaki <clergy> I wouldnt be opposed to releasing the top limit. :D
[Apr 1-09 18:53:22]Uzamaki <clergy> this rewards those who work hard. :D
[Apr 1-09 18:53:48]Nulvect <clergy> your number is off, but no, that was the whole point of updating them
[Apr 1-09 18:53:58]Uzamaki <clergy> ah
[Apr 1-09 18:54:26]Uzamaki <clergy> it is off...hrm
[Apr 1-09 18:54:34]Uzamaki <clergy> I need to work on my math more
[Apr 1-09 18:54:38]Uzamaki <clergy> hehe
[Apr 1-09 18:55:46]Uzamaki <clergy> go go gadget calculator!
[Apr 1-09 18:56:54]Uzamaki <clergy> looking closer to 1.73
[Apr 1-09 19:56:30]Uzamaki <clergy> Im broken
[Apr 1-09 19:56:40]Nulvect <clergy> how so??
[Apr 1-09 19:56:54]Uzamaki <clergy> wait, I think I'm fixed
[Apr 1-09 19:57:4]Brialar <clergy> Break him
[Apr 1-09 19:57:8]Uzamaki <clergy> was stuck midcasting
[Apr 1-09 19:57:16]Nulvect <clergy> weird.. casting what??
[Apr 1-09 19:57:22]Uzamaki <clergy> I dunno
[Apr 1-09 21:39:39]Nulvect <clergy> so I take it you druids aren't going to die from the changes or anything??
[Apr 1-09 21:40:5]Quetzel <clergy> ill know when i die i guess
[Apr 2-09 16:52:35]Cenn <clergy> hmm, think it would be possible to have summons autoattack?  like command summon to autoattack, makes them attack when you are in battle
[Apr 2-09 18:3:45]Nulvect <clergy> cenn, read help raise, I forgot to add that last bit to help summon
[Apr 2-09 18:4:5]Nulvect <clergy> should be able to 'command demon to assist me'
[Apr 3-09 0:42:5]Nulvect <clergy> I'm updating owlsmind, please don't double up on it, you'll need to quit out and relog to recast it and get your ma bonus without doubling up
[Apr 3-09 0:42:14]Nulvect <clergy> current owlsminds won't wear off
[Apr 3-09 0:42:32]Uzamaki <clergy> ok...tell me when yer done and out i go
[Apr 3-09 0:42:42]Nulvect <clergy> already updated
[Apr 3-09 0:42:48]Uzamaki <clergy> k then
[Apr 3-09 0:54:21]Nulvect <clergy> all updated
[Apr 3-09 1:11:47]Nulvect <clergy> doh, stupid old spells
[Apr 3-09 1:11:59]Nulvect <clergy> it's fine for now, will fix itself by reboot
[Apr 3-09 1:12:21]Cenn <clergy> ;o
[Apr 3-09 10:50:10]Nulvect <clergy> if you want him to stab a lot, just command him to do it
[Apr 3-09 14:24:10]Cenn <clergy> nully any chance on getting aurasink to last longer?
[Apr 3-09 14:24:32]Cenn <clergy> it's not very powerful, plus its one of the shortest MD bufsf ever
[Apr 5-09 3:16:23]Yun <clergy> hrmm wonder if you have to be a certain lvl to use the combo system
[Apr 5-09 3:16:51]Uzamaki <clergy> no clue. :(
[Apr 5-09 3:42:37]Yun <clergy> was that one??
[Apr 5-09 3:42:51]Nulvect <clergy> I'm not watching, don't know what 'that' is
[Apr 5-09 3:42:59]Yun <clergy> oo
[Apr 5-09 4:1:44]Yun <clergy> bah i dont get it... oh well
[Apr 5-09 4:2:2]Draven <clergy> get what
[Apr 5-09 4:2:18]Yun <clergy> combo thing
[Apr 7-09 12:50:42]Nulvect <clergy> ok, druid buffs should seriously wear off just fine now
[Apr 9-09 19:34:15]Geddoe <clergy> oo cool a magic defense spell
[Apr 9-09 19:35:3]Nulvect <clergy> yep
[Apr 9-09 19:35:55]Geddoe <clergy> i like it
[Apr 9-09 19:36:15]Nulvect <clergy> it's pretty basic
[Apr 9-09 19:37:57]Geddoe <clergy> hey
[Apr 9-09 19:38:7]Geddoe <clergy> have brass knuckles been incorporated into abils yet?
[Apr 9-09 19:38:23]Nulvect <clergy> I think I made them a glove that gives a skill bonus while worn
[Apr 9-09 19:38:35]Geddoe <clergy> oo really?
[Apr 9-09 19:38:41]Nulvect <clergy> seem to recall that yeah
[Apr 9-09 19:38:47]Geddoe <clergy> recently?
[Apr 9-09 19:39:13]Nulvect <clergy> no, quite a while back
[Apr 9-09 19:39:21]Geddoe <clergy> hmm
[Apr 9-09 19:39:29]Geddoe <clergy> what was it called?
[Apr 9-09 19:39:53]Nulvect <clergy> what do you mean??
[Apr 9-09 19:40:1]Geddoe <clergy> the name
[Apr 9-09 19:40:5]Geddoe <clergy> of the glove
[Apr 9-09 19:40:11]Nulvect <clergy> I didn't change the name of it
[Apr 9-09 19:40:19]Geddoe <clergy> what is it
[Apr 9-09 19:40:29]Nulvect <clergy> uh brass knuckles?? :P
[Apr 9-09 19:40:37]Geddoe <clergy> oh
[Apr 9-09 19:40:57]Geddoe <clergy> i thought you meant glove as in armour that you coded
[Apr 9-09 19:41:19]Nulvect <clergy> no I just changed the existing one
[Apr 9-09 19:41:21]Geddoe <clergy> ah
[Apr 9-09 19:41:35]Geddoe <clergy> so its no longer a weapon?
[Apr 9-09 19:41:39]Nulvect <clergy> correct
[Apr 9-09 19:41:47]Geddoe <clergy> k
[Apr 9-09 19:44:17]Geddoe <clergy> will we be getting an updated version of stuntouch or is it gone for good?
[Apr 9-09 19:44:35]Nulvect <clergy> haven't decided yet
[Apr 9-09 19:49:35]Geddoe <clergy> bah i cant remember how to get into the mirror...
[Apr 9-09 19:53:23]Geddoe <clergy> ah mantra is a 2round spell?
[Apr 9-09 19:53:39]<clergy> Nulvect nods
[Apr 9-09 19:53:51]Nulvect <clergy> you may want to read the help file for supplication though
[Apr 9-09 19:54:7]Geddoe <clergy> about the regeneration part?
[Apr 9-09 19:54:11]<clergy> Nulvect nods
[Apr 9-09 19:54:23]Geddoe <clergy> nod thats pretty pimpin aswell
[Apr 9-09 19:55:43]Geddoe <clergy> does it still give the bonus compared to how much you already have in the skill?
[Apr 9-09 19:56:43]Nulvect <clergy> it works in the same general way as before
[Apr 9-09 19:56:45]Geddoe <clergy> kk
[Apr 9-09 20:9:23]Geddoe <clergy> are all healing spells 2 rounds now?
[Apr 9-09 20:9:45]Skunk <clergy> hey ged, you get the combo to work?
[Apr 9-09 20:9:57]Geddoe <clergy> ive gotten 1
[Apr 9-09 20:10:5]Skunk <clergy> what combo of moves you use
[Apr 9-09 20:10:7]Geddoe <clergy> ive tried a couple other combinations of moves but none are working for me so far
[Apr 9-09 20:10:13]Geddoe <clergy> ive only seen jab do anything
[Apr 9-09 20:10:29]Skunk <clergy> but you don't remember what you used before jab?
[Apr 9-09 20:10:35]Geddoe <clergy> its just jab
[Apr 9-09 20:10:39]Geddoe <clergy> by itself
[Apr 9-09 20:10:41]Geddoe <clergy> a couple times
[Apr 9-09 20:10:55]Geddoe <clergy> so its the first combo you get
[Apr 9-09 20:12:11]Skunk <clergy> so it's on the third jab that a combo hits
[Apr 9-09 20:15:6]Skunk <clergy> is the jab combo the only one in right now nul? or are there more we haven't found?
[Apr 9-09 20:15:20]Nulvect <clergy> there are more
[Apr 9-09 20:16:10]Skunk <clergy> so in t heory if you chistrike, then circlekick, then furystrike that could possibly be a combo?
[Apr 9-09 20:16:34]Nulvect <clergy> well, no, because furystrike is being removed as soon as I make its replacement
[Apr 9-09 20:16:40]Skunk <clergy> ahh
[Apr 9-09 20:16:40]Geddoe <clergy> aww :(
[Apr 9-09 20:16:40]Nulvect <clergy> but that's the right idea in general :P
[Apr 9-09 20:17:0]Skunk <clergy> furystrike is cool when it hits for more then one hit ;)
[Apr 9-09 20:17:10]Skunk <clergy> but it's way too random
[Apr 9-09 20:18:2]Nulvect <clergy> furystrike and crushingblow are going on the chopping block
[Apr 9-09 20:18:12]Geddoe <clergy> :(
[Apr 9-09 20:18:12]Skunk <clergy> eagleclaw?
[Apr 9-09 20:18:30]Nulvect <clergy> everything else you have right now is staying
[Apr 9-09 20:18:36]Skunk <clergy> sweet
[Apr 9-09 20:18:42]Skunk <clergy> i like eagleclaw ;)
[Apr 9-09 20:18:50]Geddoe <clergy> i miss stuntouch :(
[Apr 9-09 20:18:52]Skunk <clergy> we getting a L50 move?
[Apr 9-09 20:18:56]Nulvect <clergy> yep
[Apr 9-09 20:19:8]Skunk <clergy> use chistrike ged, knocks em on their ass
[Apr 9-09 20:19:20]Geddoe <clergy> heh
[Apr 9-09 20:19:34]Skunk <clergy> are we getting a replacement for crushingblow or no inits?
[Apr 9-09 20:20:4]Nulvect <clergy> chistrike, circlekick, and eagleclaw will be getting modifications, and there are 3 more attacks coming in, plus a couple defensive things and some 'other' stuff
[Apr 9-09 20:20:10]Geddoe <clergy> heh
[Apr 9-09 20:20:18]Skunk <clergy> cool right on nul
[Apr 9-09 20:20:26]Nulvect <clergy> there will be a sort of init
[Apr 9-09 20:20:48]Skunk <clergy> do we get any sort of grappling moves? like a throw or a sweep to knock em down?
[Apr 9-09 20:21:12]Nulvect <clergy> grappling is hard to do right
[Apr 9-09 20:21:12]Skunk <clergy> hiplock em to the ground kneel on their chest and pound their face :D
[Apr 9-09 20:21:28]Skunk <clergy> almost like a thug choke
[Apr 9-09 20:21:48]Nulvect <clergy> yeah choke is the only grappling style move we have and that thing is a cluster..uh..bomb
[Apr 9-09 20:22:2]Skunk <clergy> ahh not a fan of choke eh?
[Apr 9-09 20:22:20]Nulvect <clergy> well, I wrote it... it's just a big mess
[Apr 9-09 20:22:32]Skunk <clergy> i like the concept though for sure
[Apr 9-09 20:24:58]Skunk <clergy> stuff dies too fast before i can try out all the combo options :P
[Apr 9-09 20:25:4]Geddoe <clergy> heh i know
[Apr 9-09 20:25:34]Geddoe <clergy> we need an area attack :D
[Apr 9-09 20:25:38]Geddoe <clergy> nutcheck every mob
[Apr 9-09 20:25:40]Skunk <clergy> :P
[Apr 9-09 20:25:48]Geddoe <clergy> cripple them
[Apr 9-09 20:25:50]Nulvect <clergy> haha
[Apr 9-09 20:25:56]Skunk <clergy> hey nul, are all the combos going to on the third move or different?
[Apr 9-09 20:26:24]Skunk <clergy> like 10 jabs to the face and your head implodes?
[Apr 9-09 20:26:40]Nulvect <clergy> they're going to range
[Apr 9-09 20:26:46]Skunk <clergy> gotcha
[Apr 9-09 20:27:30]Geddoe <clergy> gotten any other combos skunk?
[Apr 9-09 20:27:38]Skunk <clergy> no just the one you told me
[Apr 9-09 20:27:44]Geddoe <clergy> we need a combo list :(
[Apr 9-09 20:27:56]Skunk <clergy> we should start recording what all we have tested
[Apr 9-09 20:28:2]Skunk <clergy> and post it on monk board
[Apr 9-09 20:28:16]Geddoe <clergy> well
[Apr 9-09 20:28:30]Geddoe <clergy> the ones nulvect said are going to be removed we shouldnt even bother with
[Apr 9-09 20:28:30]Skunk <clergy> two snapkicks and a circlekick and your leg detaches and whacks all the mobs in the room!!
[Apr 9-09 20:28:36]Skunk <clergy> aye
[Apr 9-09 20:28:44]Geddoe <clergy> hehe
[Apr 9-09 20:28:56]Geddoe <clergy> pull an optimus prime and your hand shoots
[Apr 9-09 20:29:16]Skunk <clergy> most stuff dies in 3-4 moves though :()
[Apr 9-09 20:29:26]Skunk <clergy> i need more hp and just go sit in hell
[Apr 9-09 20:30:26]Cenn <clergy> combos = just monks aye
[Apr 9-09 20:30:40]Skunk <clergy> should be
[Apr 9-09 20:30:42]Cenn <clergy> nod
[Apr 9-09 20:30:48]Geddoe <clergy> yeah
[Apr 9-09 20:33:0]Nulvect <clergy> technically they could be added for anyone, but I don't foresee doing that
[Apr 9-09 20:33:12]Skunk <clergy> that's cool
[Apr 9-09 20:33:20]Skunk <clergy> nice to have something for just monks ;)
[Apr 9-09 20:34:38]Geddoe <clergy> youll have to be higher level im assuming to get alot of combos
[Apr 9-09 20:34:48]Geddoe <clergy> cause nulvect told me it wouldnt be effective at my level
[Apr 9-09 20:34:50]Skunk <clergy> i'm at L40 now
[Apr 9-09 20:34:52]Geddoe <clergy> or something along those lines
[Apr 9-09 20:34:56]Geddoe <clergy> and im 34
[Apr 9-09 20:35:6]Nulvect <clergy> no, I meant because most of the ones in are newbish moves
[Apr 9-09 20:35:8]Skunk <clergy> so i guess it's time to level up to elite again...
[Apr 9-09 20:35:12]Geddoe <clergy> oh
[Apr 9-09 20:35:16]Skunk <clergy> ahhh gotcha
[Apr 9-09 20:35:16]Nulvect <clergy> generally I work from newbie up
[Apr 9-09 20:35:20]Geddoe <clergy> well i asked what you meant and you never answered heh
[Apr 9-09 20:35:34]Skunk <clergy> is the L50 going to be an attack?
[Apr 9-09 20:35:40]Nulvect <clergy> you'll see
[Apr 9-09 20:35:44]Skunk <clergy> phooey :P
[Apr 9-09 20:36:2]Nulvect <clergy> got two more things to add after reboot though
[Apr 9-09 20:36:10]Skunk <clergy> do i need to start leveling up or will it be sooniish?
[Apr 9-09 20:36:52]Nulvect <clergy> shrug, that's up to you
[Apr 9-09 23:37:0]Geddoe <clergy> so supplication doesnt work when you have buffs?
[Apr 9-09 23:38:12]Nulvect <clergy> sure it does
[Apr 9-09 23:38:25]Geddoe <clergy> i dont get any stats when i use it while buffed
[Apr 9-09 23:38:34]Nulvect <clergy> it just doesn't stack with other things
[Apr 9-09 23:38:36]Geddoe <clergy> 18 str before supp, 18 str after supp
[Apr 9-09 23:38:49]Geddoe <clergy> so it doesnt work
[Apr 9-09 23:38:57]Merdon <clergy> you prolly just get the bonus regenation
[Apr 9-09 23:39:5]Geddoe <clergy> ah yeah theres that too
[Apr 9-09 23:39:5]Merdon <clergy> with no stat bouns
[Apr 9-09 23:39:11]Nulvect <clergy> you get all the parts that aren't already buffed
[Apr 9-09 23:39:19]Merdon <clergy> nods
[Apr 9-09 23:39:21]Geddoe <clergy> k
[Apr 9-09 23:39:24]Geddoe <clergy> so are all healing spells 2 round now?
[Apr 9-09 23:40:1]Nulvect <clergy> not all, healing is secondary for monks
[Apr 9-09 23:40:6]Geddoe <clergy> ok cool
[Apr 9-09 23:40:12]Geddoe <clergy> that puts me at ease
[Apr 9-09 23:49:33]Geddoe <clergy> so nul
[Apr 9-09 23:49:45]Geddoe <clergy> how soon till furystrike is removed
[Apr 9-09 23:50:35]Nulvect <clergy> maybe tonight, else this weekend
[Apr 9-09 23:50:43]Geddoe <clergy> cool cool
[Apr 9-09 23:57:57]Geddoe <clergy> so any chance of a nutcheck all?
[Apr 9-09 23:58:23]Geddoe <clergy> maybe our equivalent of clobber? coughing up blood and whatnot?
[Apr 9-09 23:59:3]Nulvect <clergy> yeah, I bet stormy would love if I made a 'nutcheck' ability
[Apr 10-09 0:52:8]Geddoe <clergy> so, new combos or what
[Apr 10-09 1:14:2]Geddoe <clergy> oh wow
[Apr 10-09 1:14:10]Geddoe <clergy> lol +-16
[Apr 10-09 1:15:10]Geddoe <clergy> thats pretty cool
[Apr 10-09 1:15:12]Geddoe <clergy> reminds me of jade empire
[Apr 10-09 1:16:58]Geddoe <clergy> thats pretty cool
[Apr 10-09 1:17:46]Uzamaki <clergy> Thanks for holyarmour, Nulvect!!!
[Apr 10-09 1:18:58]Geddoe <clergy> druids get it?
[Apr 10-09 1:19:30]Uzamaki <clergy> heh, dont need it
[Apr 10-09 1:19:38]Uzamaki <clergy> nom, for monk n other sub
[Apr 10-09 1:19:40]Nulvect <clergy> no, and no problem
[Apr 10-09 2:49:13]Scoff <clergy> i dont get this combo stuff
[Apr 10-09 2:49:25]Scoff <clergy> else am 2 small to perform combos
[Apr 10-09 2:50:23]Scoff <clergy> oh,, i get it now
[Apr 10-09 3:8:5]Scoff <clergy> Nulvect
[Apr 10-09 3:8:17]Scoff <clergy> Love the idea of fighting styles
[Apr 12-09 3:14:38]Geddoe <clergy> so how close is the new furystrike?
[Apr 12-09 3:15:16]Nulvect <clergy> uh, I wouldn't call it a new furystrike
[Apr 12-09 3:15:30]Geddoe <clergy> well
[Apr 12-09 3:15:34]Geddoe <clergy> replacement
[Apr 12-09 3:16:10]Nulvect <clergy> first I'm doing a new circlekick, then an attack to fit in where furystrike is, then I'll probably take it out
[Apr 12-09 3:16:20]Geddoe <clergy> nod
[Apr 14-09 23:25:27]Geddoe <clergy> hows monk coming
[Apr 14-09 23:32:11]Nulvect <clergy> it's coming, finished circlekick today
[Apr 14-09 23:36:13]Geddoe <clergy> nice
[Apr 14-09 23:36:17]Geddoe <clergy> is it in?
[Apr 14-09 23:37:37]Nulvect <clergy> yep
[Apr 15-09 19:12:36]Skunk <clergy> new monk posts
[Apr 16-09 0:55:22]Geisha <clergy> Ooo I'm 'godly'~
[Apr 16-09 0:58:38]Briar <clergy> hehe
[Apr 16-09 1:24:36]Skunk <clergy> hey nul, not sure if you want it to work this way, but combos still hit over a mobs death
[Apr 16-09 1:25:0]Nulvect <clergy> you mean if the mob dies mid-combo but you continue on another mob the combo still happens??
[Apr 16-09 1:25:10]Skunk <clergy> yes
[Apr 16-09 1:25:38]Nulvect <clergy> yeah, that's fine
[Apr 16-09 1:25:40]Skunk <clergy> cool
[Apr 16-09 1:25:52]Skunk <clergy> and the palmstrike circlekick combo is rad :D
[Apr 16-09 1:27:6]Nulvect <clergy> I may change the exact combos based on balance needs, but all your physical attacks will work in combos
[Apr 16-09 1:27:14]Nulvect <clergy> it's still sort of in progress
[Apr 16-09 1:30:19]Skunk <clergy> well i like where you are going with em, worth the wait :D
[Apr 27-09 2:44:6]<clergy> Ishkur wonders what syntax is used to search through the soil in this coffin.
[Apr 27-09 15:58:29]Billa <clergy> u go girl
[Apr 27-09 15:58:35]Zub <clergy> :p
[Apr 27-09 15:58:43]Billa <clergy> raknid was prolly a bad choice for monk huh:P
[Apr 27-09 15:58:49]Zub <clergy> lol shrug
[Apr 28-09 19:25:12]Mez <clergy> Why doesnt absorb work Nul?
[Apr 28-09 19:26:12]Nulvect <clergy> I dunno
[Apr 28-09 19:26:26]Mez <clergy> hehe should it be?
[Apr 28-09 19:27:18]Nulvect <clergy> the spell works fine
[Apr 28-09 19:27:34]Mez <clergy> all it says when I use it is nothing happens
[Apr 28-09 19:28:18]Nulvect <clergy> should be slightly more informative now
[Apr 28-09 19:28:56]Mez <clergy> so its not a kataan usable spell?
[Apr 28-09 19:29:12]Mez <clergy>  oh im holy
[Apr 28-09 19:29:36]Mez <clergy> wonder how that happened
[Apr 28-09 22:44:47]Mez <clergy> Is hellfire supposed to hit your mounts?
[Apr 28-09 22:47:7]Yin <clergy> yeah hellfire his everything in the room
[Apr 28-09 22:47:27]Mez <clergy> It shouldnt hit our mounts though :(
[Apr 28-09 22:49:33]Nulvect <clergy> kataan spells hit everything on purpose
[Apr 28-09 22:50:5]Mez <clergy> So that means inferi is useless xp
[Apr 28-09 22:53:57]Nulvect <clergy> I would disagree, but everyone seems to have such defeatist attitudes these days there's not much point :P
[Apr 29-09 2:46:56]Zub <clergy> hey nul, is heal suppose to take up 2 rnds?
[Apr 29-09 2:47:30]Nulvect <clergy> yeah
[Apr 29-09 2:47:32]Zub <clergy> kk
[Apr 29-09 2:48:4]Cenn <clergy> thats weird lol
[Apr 29-09 2:48:40]Zub <clergy> lol
[Apr 29-09 2:48:46]Zub <clergy> i got no problem usin oils :)
[Apr 29-09 2:54:48]Nulvect <clergy> shrug, guess it doesn't really make sense, changed to 1 round
[Apr 29-09 2:55:48]Cenn <clergy> nice
[Apr 29-09 2:55:58]Cenn <clergy> can demonfire be 1 round too ;p
[Apr 29-09 8:3:52]Maddock <clergy> OOoh noes
[Apr 29-09 8:5:24]Mez <clergy> im getting used to it
[Apr 29-09 8:6:34]Mez <clergy> for some reason I always lose a wisdom...
[Apr 29-09 8:7:42]Mez <clergy> these mobs are glitched
[May 1-09 6:47:47]Briar <clergy> heh double spinkick
[May 1-09 7:4:17]Maddock <clergy> nice
[May 6-09 22:5:19]Teufel <clergy> yaya?
[May 6-09 22:5:35]Thantos <clergy> WHO ARE YOU
[May 6-09 22:5:49]Teufel <clergy> take the Z away and i might know who it is...
[May 6-09 22:5:53]Xiaoz <clergy> didnt like my druid decided to try cleriic
[May 6-09 22:18:48]Thantos <clergy> anyone remember wat lvl kataan gets hellfire?
[May 6-09 22:19:14]Xiaoz <clergy> my 19 dosent have it so um guessing 25-30ish
[May 6-09 22:19:18]Xiaoz <clergy> thats about all i know.
[May 6-09 22:19:58]Thantos <clergy> hrm
[May 6-09 22:20:4]Thantos <clergy> i dont remember when i got it
[May 6-09 23:27:57]Xiaoz <clergy> anyone know what my next offensive spell is after pain
[May 7-09 15:24:43]Seon <clergy> anyone know what the next atack spell is after pain
[May 7-09 15:25:35]Annie <clergy> No idea :/
[May 7-09 17:2:56]Seon <clergy> whats the best way to raise alignment
[May 7-09 17:7:28]Seon <clergy> u emptying out sewers teu?
[May 7-09 17:7:36]Teufel <clergy> doing to second lvl
[May 7-09 18:9:41]Quetzel <clergy> i dont know on either of those
[May 10-09 4:12:54]Seon <clergy> hey cenn, happen to know if or when clerics get lifewrap?
[May 20-09 0:59:56]Seon <clergy> lots of clergy
[May 20-09 1:57:52]Skunk <clergy> hey nul have you taken a look at sp costs lately for monks? seems kinda high but could be me
[May 20-09 1:58:20]Nulvect <clergy> since I've rewritten most of that stuff from scratch, yeah, I've looked at the costs
[May 20-09 1:58:28]Skunk <clergy> ok
[May 20-09 1:59:8]Nulvect <clergy> I'll be looking back over it when I finish the rest of your stuff
[May 20-09 1:59:8]Teufel <clergy> is the damage high?
[May 20-09 1:59:14]Nulvect <clergy> need to adjust the combo bonuses anyway
[May 20-09 1:59:54]Skunk <clergy> that's cool, just seemed like a lot, but then i guess my mage aoe uses a ton of mp
[May 20-09 2:1:58]Seon <clergy> yea non angel is fairly rough
[May 29-09 1:43:51]Nulvect <clergy> I am still open to some faith spells (no damage though), if you happen to be struck with inspiration
[May 29-09 1:45:23]Billa <clergy> an md spell would be awesome
[May 29-09 1:45:45]Nulvect <clergy> you get a pretty strong one actually
[May 29-09 1:45:51]Billa <clergy> or a spell like supplication that gives int/wis
[May 29-09 1:46:59]Nulvect <clergy> hmm
[May 29-09 1:47:21]Billa <clergy> or a meditate command for clergy
[May 29-09 1:47:31]Billa <clergy> make it like rest except it gives more vitals per round
[May 29-09 1:47:55]Nulvect <clergy> well... you do realize supplication makes you heal faster now, right??
[May 29-09 1:48:5]Billa <clergy> didn't notice that, nope
[May 29-09 1:52:55]Billa <clergy> can I ask what stat helps circlekick themost?
[May 29-09 1:53:45]Nulvect <clergy> sure, but I won't answer
[May 29-09 1:53:51]Billa <clergy> lol
[May 29-09 2:1:31]Billa <clergy> man
[May 29-09 2:1:41]Billa <clergy> out of every subclass I've xped on here
[May 29-09 2:1:45]Billa <clergy> this is probably the slowest
[May 29-09 2:12:41]Nulvect <clergy> that sounds rather odd
[May 29-09 2:13:59]Billa <clergy> ?
[May 29-09 2:15:5]Nulvect <clergy> combos should make you exp faster than most one on ones
[May 29-09 2:21:21]Billa <clergy> what all combos?
[May 29-09 2:21:35]Billa <clergy> and I am only lvl 15..
[May 29-09 2:22:25]Nulvect <clergy> all your attacks have the possibility of comboing
[May 29-09 2:22:33]Nulvect <clergy> you'll know it when you see it
[May 29-09 2:38:3]Geddoe <clergy> gonna keep magic attack there?
[May 29-09 2:38:23]Nulvect <clergy> no
[May 29-09 2:38:31]Nulvect <clergy> it does nothing for you, and it will be removed
[May 29-09 2:38:35]Geddoe <clergy> nod
[May 29-09 2:39:17]Geddoe <clergy> oh yeah that is much better
[May 29-09 2:39:23]Geddoe <clergy> sp
[May 29-09 2:39:55]Nulvect <clergy> nod, I came up with a nice standard way of doing costs so they don't get out of hand
[Jun 4-09 23:48:51]Brialar <clergy> Welcome
[Jun 9-09 18:30:26]Skunk <clergy> hey nul
[Jun 9-09 18:30:30]Nulvect <clergy> hey
[Jun 9-09 18:30:38]Skunk <clergy> what did you think about the 'blend' idea?
[Jun 9-09 18:32:12]Nulvect <clergy> well, I don't think changing the color you show up as in the room is much help
[Jun 9-09 18:32:30]Nulvect <clergy> and pseudo stealth isn't really a monk thing
[Jun 9-09 18:32:50]Skunk <clergy> hrm, i guess that's a good point
[Jun 11-09 0:10:12]Mogwai <clergy> hey Nul, is magic attack still somthing i shouldn't raise as a monk?
[Jun 11-09 0:10:34]Nulvect <clergy> that is correct, it does nothing and will be removed in the future
[Jun 11-09 0:10:40]Mogwai <clergy> cool thanks
[Jun 11-09 17:32:48]Mogwai <clergy> gota say the changes to monk are pretty cool.  well, i didn't play BEFORE they were changed, but the martial-arts style combat that's in now is cool
[Jun 11-09 17:34:16]Nulvect <clergy> glad you like it
[Jun 11-09 17:34:36]Mogwai <clergy> definately
[Jun 11-09 17:34:42]Mogwai <clergy> and the pacing is pretty cool too
[Jun 11-09 17:35:24]Mogwai <clergy> mmm new combos
[Jun 11-09 17:42:30]Mogwai <clergy> oh, did have one other question though, magic attack is the only one that's getting taken out, right? the others should still be raised?
[Jun 11-09 17:56:22]Nulvect <clergy> correct, though your weapon skill maxes are definitely going to be reduced a lot
[Jun 11-09 17:56:42]Nulvect <clergy> I should probably just put in all these skill changes instead of warning people perpetually
[Jun 11-09 17:58:28]Mogwai <clergy> hehe
[Jun 11-09 17:58:36]Mogwai <clergy> as long as i have a general plan i'm fine :)
[Jun 13-09 1:34:17]Mogwai <clergy> hey nul
[Jun 13-09 1:34:31]Nulvect <clergy> hey
[Jun 13-09 1:34:45]Mogwai <clergy> If you ever have a minute, and it's just a suggestion, but take lich and vampire off've the races list
[Jun 13-09 1:35:1]Nulvect <clergy> hmm they show up in the beginning race list??
[Jun 13-09 1:35:15]Mogwai <clergy> like, for example there's been a couple people that i've talked into trying this mud, and they're like oo lich, oh i can't be one.. what about vampire? no....
[Jun 13-09 1:35:21]Mogwai <clergy> nod
[Jun 13-09 1:35:37]Nulvect <clergy> been so long since I made a char here that I forgot about that
[Jun 13-09 1:35:39]Mogwai <clergy> at least they show up on help races
[Jun 13-09 1:35:53]Nulvect <clergy> well they should show up there
[Jun 13-09 1:36:15]Mogwai <clergy> oh, are they actually in?
[Jun 13-09 1:36:27]Nulvect <clergy> not exactly
[Jun 13-09 1:37:13]Mogwai <clergy> right on, just a thought though, just as far as new people trying the mud they always ask about those and seem to be disappointed they're not in yet, etc
[Jun 13-09 1:37:23]Nulvect <clergy> hmm
[Aug 20-09 13:1:53]Nulvect <clergy> does it matter which spell you're using knuckle??
[Aug 20-09 13:2:59]Nulvect <clergy> mudmail me a copy/paste and I will try to fix it later, I'm unfortunately out of time just now

[Nov 22-09 2:32:28]Geddoe <clergy> levin lasted 2 rounds and nearly got me killed again :P
[Nov 22-09 2:33:42]Geddoe <clergy> i think
[Nov 22-09 2:40:16]Nulvect <clergy> shrug
[Nov 22-09 2:40:24]Nulvect <clergy> I hate levin, inclined to take it out again
[Nov 22-09 2:40:30]Geddoe <clergy> nah dont do that
[Nov 22-09 2:40:34]Geddoe <clergy> clerics will be totally useless then
[Nov 22-09 2:41:2]Nulvect <clergy> not meant to be big damage dealers
[Nov 22-09 2:41:18]Geddoe <clergy> well they have to do some kind of kinda decent damage
[Nov 22-09 2:44:12]Nulvect <clergy> bleh
[Nov 22-09 2:44:32]Nulvect <clergy> I've modified the alignment loss from some cleric spells
[Nov 22-09 2:44:46]Geddoe <clergy> nah it aint the alignment loss that hurts
[Nov 22-09 2:44:50]Geddoe <clergy> thats isnanely easy to fix
[Nov 22-09 2:44:54]Geddoe <clergy> its just the low damage
[Nov 22-09 2:45:44]Nulvect <clergy> shrug, healers
[Nov 22-09 2:46:2]Geddoe <clergy> yeha i know, they are hard to kill
[Nov 22-09 2:48:0]Nulvect <clergy> levin will not stay as it is, just to let you know
[Nov 22-09 2:48:8]Geddoe <clergy> whats wrong with it?
[Nov 22-09 2:48:24]Nulvect <clergy> it is clearly overpowered and quite difficult to balance
[Nov 22-09 2:48:40]Geddoe <clergy> ah, i didnt think it was
[Nov 22-09 2:48:46]Geddoe <clergy> overpowered that is

[Apr 3-10 2:50:6]Skunk <clergy> decent every now and then if i remember, can't use often though, it's timed
[Apr 3-10 2:51:28]Agnidev <clergy> doh
[Apr 3-10 2:51:50]Agnidev <clergy> can monks kill huge mobs?
[Apr 3-10 2:51:56]Agnidev <clergy> like drow queen and stuff?
[Apr 3-10 2:52:10]Skunk <clergy> i'm sure we can, just need the stats
[Apr 3-10 2:52:34]Agnidev <clergy> like equivalent stats to fighter does it?
[Apr 3-10 2:52:48]Skunk <clergy> dunno bout fighters much

[Apr 3-10 2:54:27]Skunk <clergy> gotta run though
[Apr 4-10 22:4:16]Agnidev <clergy> theres another combo skunk
[Apr 4-10 22:4:32]Agnidev <clergy> snapkick + circlekick + snapkick
[Apr 6-10 11:3:15]Knuckle <clergy> hey aethion what do you xp with?

[Apr 6-10 11:3:37]Aethion <clergy> aoe with mad magic defense
[Apr 6-10 11:3:37]Knuckle <clergy> how much sp does it take?
[Apr 6-10 11:3:47]Aethion <clergy> not alot, depends on the number of mobs
[Apr 6-10 11:3:57]Knuckle <clergy> how much for a room of 4?
[Apr 6-10 11:4:9]Aethion <clergy> tell ya in a sec
[Apr 6-10 11:5:33]Aethion <clergy> like 2-300 sp
[Apr 6-10 11:5:43]Aethion <clergy> but smite is healing me :P
[Apr 6-10 11:7:33]Knuckle <clergy> wow...
[Apr 6-10 11:7:35]Knuckle <clergy> nice :D
[Apr 6-10 11:15:31]Aethion <clergy> this is so scary
[Apr 6-10 11:15:41]Aethion <clergy> sometimes we kill 4 120K+ mobs at once
[Apr 22-10 20:45:6]Stormbringer <clergy> ummm your not high enough level for rezz Ged
[Apr 22-10 20:45:12]Geddoe <clergy> i know
[Apr 22-10 20:45:24]Geddoe <clergy> its not a level requirement though
[Apr 22-10 20:45:26]Geddoe <clergy> just skill
[Apr 22-10 20:45:38]Stormbringer <clergy> well technically
[Apr 22-10 20:45:42]Geddoe <clergy> 300 healing
[Apr 22-10 20:45:56]Geddoe <clergy> couple abilities that buff skills and stats
[Apr 22-10 20:46:8]Geddoe <clergy> specifically bards "healers chant"
[Apr 29-10 23:3:6]Geddoe <clergy> so nul
[Apr 29-10 23:3:12]Geddoe <clergy> any thoughts as to my last post?
[Apr 29-10 23:3:30]Nulvect <clergy> on cleric board??
[Apr 29-10 23:3:32]Geddoe <clergy> yeah
[Apr 29-10 23:3:36]Nulvect <clergy> I agree
[Apr 29-10 23:3:38]Geddoe <clergy> about wis having an effect on healing
[Apr 29-10 23:3:44]Nulvect <clergy> healing spells need to be rebalanced
[Apr 29-10 23:3:58]Nulvect <clergy> I had thought most of the old ones were ok, but I guess not
[Apr 29-10 23:4:14]Geddoe <clergy> yeah I can only heal 340 a pop
[Apr 29-10 23:4:32]Geddoe <clergy> despite almost 200 wis :(

[May 7-10 16:24:0]Yun <clergy> hey Nul everytime i connect with the surgingblow/palmstrike combo i wanna say SHOYUKEN!
[May 7-10 18:38:2]Nulvect <clergy> hehe that was the point :P
[May 29-10 4:17:10]Knuckle <clergy> hey nul you thr?
[May 29-10 4:20:0]Knuckle <clergy> anyway what i was thinking was can kataans get a better con bonus since they dont have a whole lot of MD and they need to room spell?
[May 29-10 4:54:6]Nulvect <clergy> I don't think a con bonus fits kataans that well, especially since they have some nice bonuses already
[May 29-10 4:54:18]Knuckle <clergy> nod
[May 29-10 4:55:48]Knuckle <clergy> i just thought since we xp mostly with room spells i could take bigger rooms with con bonus but its not that big of a deal :D
[May 29-10 4:57:58]Nulvect <clergy> kataans aren't actually focused on area attacks, they're about 50/50 area and single
[May 29-10 4:59:6]Knuckle <clergy> nod
[Jun 1-10 1:43:47]Scoff <clergy> lol

[Aug 23-10 23:1:31]Skrymer <clergy> oops my bad
[Oct 2-10 21:21:52]Tai <clergy> crap hellfire acting wierd
[Oct 2-10 21:22:50]Tai <clergy> Nul, somethin up with hellfire, and its consistant this time :P
[Oct 2-10 21:23:27]Tai <clergy> ouch almost died that time
[Oct 2-10 21:26:10]Nulvect <clergy> why do you always break things
[Oct 2-10 21:26:24]Nulvect <clergy> ok watching... or you can describe it to me
[Oct 2-10 21:26:37]Tai <clergy> hehe
[Oct 2-10 21:27:12]Tai <clergy> well sometimes hellfire will skip a round and in that round it says you are concentrating on hellfire but you cant move either
[Oct 2-10 21:27:44]Tai <clergy> like that time was trying to go north
[Oct 2-10 21:28:24]Tai <clergy> i dont break things that offten right?
[Oct 2-10 21:28:48]Nulvect <clergy> haha no I was just kidding
[Oct 2-10 21:28:52]Tai <clergy> hehe
[Oct 2-10 21:29:30]Nulvect <clergy> ok so I saw what was going on
[Oct 2-10 21:29:38]Nulvect <clergy> let me see how hard this will be to fix
[Oct 2-10 21:29:46]Tai <clergy> hehe
[Oct 2-10 21:34:12]Nulvect <clergy> ok, it's related to how paralyzing works, not hellfire specifically...
[Oct 2-10 21:34:20]Tai <clergy> ooo
[Oct 2-10 21:34:28]Nulvect <clergy> a fair amount of work to fix... but something I've been meaning to do anyway
[Oct 2-10 21:34:40]Tai <clergy> kool
[Oct 2-10 21:36:24]Nulvect <clergy> basically... I'll be making it into a standard effect like blindness or poison... right now it's got a lot of cruft because it's such an old piece of code
[Oct 2-10 21:36:48]Tai <clergy> oo lotta work
[Oct 2-10 21:37:6]Tai <clergy> i like poison :)
[Oct 2-10 21:37:56]Nulvect <clergy> does it work well??
[Oct 2-10 21:38:34]Tai <clergy> oo dont have any poison stuff, just like poison in general
[Oct 2-10 21:38:46]Nulvect <clergy> ah
[Oct 2-10 21:38:52]Tai <clergy> i need to up my scout before i get some i think
[Oct 2-10 21:38:58]Tai <clergy> he only 19 atm
[Oct 2-10 21:39:50]Tai <clergy> does poison ever get to the point where it paras people?
[Oct 2-10 21:40:10]Tai <clergy> or just make them slower and cost more sp/hp/mp to do abilities
[Oct 2-10 21:41:40]Nulvect <clergy> poison just slowly lowers hp/sp/mp and raises body damage
[Oct 2-10 21:42:10]Tai <clergy> kool
[Oct 2-10 21:42:46]Nulvect <clergy> in general, anyway... I plan for there to be poisons that do other things in addition
[Oct 2-10 21:42:54]Tai <clergy> sweet
[Oct 31-10 16:23:33]Methvia <clergy> How are these combos Aeth?
[Oct 31-10 16:23:39]Aethion <clergy> good
[Oct 31-10 16:24:9]Aethion <clergy> there are plenty of effects, from damage, damage+body damage, stuns, knockdowns
[Oct 31-10 16:24:25]Knuckle <clergy> i like palmstrike + surgingblow :D
[Oct 31-10 16:24:45]Methvia <clergy> Hmm, i'll have to test em up :d
[Oct 31-10 16:24:51]Knuckle <clergy> constant para except for first hit
[Oct 31-10 16:52:41]Aethion <clergy> chistrike+surgingblow does the same thing as palmstrike+surgingblow
[Oct 31-10 16:52:58]Aethion <clergy> chistrike does more damage tho
[Oct 31-10 16:53:15]Methvia <clergy> Ahh, get chistrike after palmstrike?
[Oct 31-10 16:53:23]Aethion <clergy> pretty sure yea
[Oct 31-10 16:53:29]Aethion <clergy> chistrike+chiblast is ridic
[Oct 31-10 16:53:37]Aethion <clergy> with buffs my chiblast did like 1500
[Oct 31-10 16:53:47]Methvia <clergy> What....
[Nov 2-10 0:1:5]Methvia <clergy> Think we could add 3 hit combos? :D
[Nov 2-10 0:1:29]Methvia <clergy> Or maybe there are some and I just haven't figured them out yet.
[Nov 2-10 2:6:23]Nulvect <clergy> there are tons of 3 hit combos
[Nov 2-10 2:6:31]Nulvect <clergy> there's even a couple longer than that
[Nov 2-10 2:7:1]Methvia <clergy> woooo
[Nov 2-10 2:7:11]Methvia <clergy> Higher levels? Or do I have some now?/
[Nov 2-10 2:8:9]Nulvect <clergy> there are definitely some that you have now :P
[Nov 2-10 2:8:21]Methvia <clergy> awwww snap, gotta figure this out!
[Nov 2-10 2:8:37]Methvia <clergy> Is mantra a boost over time?
[Nov 2-10 2:8:57]Methvia <clergy> I see it has a cooldown, maybe instead of one huge boost it does it over 3-4 rounds?
[Nov 2-10 2:9:23]Nulvect <clergy> have you noticed it healing over several rounds??
[Nov 2-10 2:9:33]Methvia <clergy> No, lol
[Nov 2-10 2:9:49]Nulvect <clergy> well, there you go
[Nov 2-10 2:10:51]Methvia <clergy> I'd rather it go over time, like mantra before combat... and you sp regen over 3-4 rounds while fighting
[Nov 2-10 2:11:19]Nulvect <clergy> not a bad suggestion
[Nov 2-10 2:11:29]Nulvect <clergy> post it up
[Nov 2-10 2:11:37]Methvia <clergy> Monk board or clergy?
[Nov 2-10 2:11:47]Nulvect <clergy> monk preferrably
[Nov 2-10 2:11:51]<clergy> Methvia nods
[Nov 2-10 2:12:53]<clergy> Uzamaki wants to suggest the <tame> command for druids. :)
[Nov 2-10 2:15:25]Nulvect <clergy> tame is definitely on my list
[Nov 2-10 2:15:31]Uzamaki <clergy> woo!
[Nov 2-10 2:16:47]Methvia <clergy> so hard to figure these out! LOL
[Nov 2-10 2:16:59]Uzamaki <clergy> figure what out?
[Nov 2-10 2:17:15]Methvia <clergy> combos :d
[Nov 2-10 2:17:19]Uzamaki <clergy> ahhh
[Nov 2-10 2:17:29]Uzamaki <clergy> I should try a monk sometime.
[Nov 2-10 2:17:49]<clergy> Uzamaki has never been a bog fan of monks for some reason
[Nov 2-10 2:18:3]Methvia <clergy> They = greatness
[Nov 2-10 2:18:9]Uzamaki <clergy> lol
[Nov 2-10 2:18:15]Uzamaki <clergy> if u say so

[Nov 2-10 2:19:25]Methvia <clergy> Ownt
[Nov 2-10 11:47:2]Methvia <clergy> I'd say Rangers could get a companion
[Nov 2-10 11:47:38]Nulvect <clergy> nod... now say that where morgana can hear it ;P
[Nov 2-10 11:47:50]<clergy> Methvia slaps

[Jan 1-11 19:30:16]Nulvect <clergy> what does it say when you try
[Jan 1-11 19:30:32]Knuckle <clergy> Instill fear in whom?
[Jan 1-11 19:30:52]Knuckle <clergy> and im thinking if im in combat it should just straight fear without arguments
[Jan 1-11 19:31:4]Nulvect <clergy> nod, let me check it out
[Jan 1-11 19:31:8]Knuckle <clergy> cool thanks
[Jan 1-11 19:31:17]Nulvect <clergy> this wifi I'm borrowing is kind of sucky though
[Jan 1-11 19:31:26]Knuckle <clergy> its cool you can do it later, ill remind you
[Jan 1-11 19:40:51]Nulvect <clergy> ok, try now
[Jan 1-11 19:41:33]Knuckle <clergy> doesnt look like anyone is around atm
[Jan 1-11 19:41:42]Knuckle <clergy> but ill check and get back to you
[Jan 1-11 19:41:48]Nulvect <clergy> alrighty

[Feb 1-11 19:55:49]Agnidev <clergy> nullllllll reduce cost on circlekick.......
[Feb 2-11 23:21:41]Agnidev <clergy> hey nul
[Feb 2-11 23:21:49]Nulvect <clergy> hey
[Feb 2-11 23:22:1]Agnidev <clergy> can ironskin be made so that it cannot be cast at []s and such?
[Feb 2-11 23:22:57]Nulvect <clergy> or you could turn your trigger off when not exping
[Feb 2-11 23:23:1]Agnidev <clergy> i do
[Feb 2-11 23:23:49]Agnidev <clergy> i dont turn my trigger off but i take my alias off but its all cool
[Feb 2-11 23:24:3]Agnidev <clergy> thanks
[Feb 2-11 23:24:10]Nulvect <clergy> so you would prefer if you couldn't use it in no-attack rooms??
[Feb 2-11 23:24:31]Agnidev <clergy> yeah well all other spells are that way anyway
[Feb 2-11 23:24:37]Agnidev <clergy> i thought this mightev been a bug
[Feb 2-11 23:25:5]Nulvect <clergy> it's not a spell, it's an ability that uses mp
[Feb 2-11 23:35:7]Agnidev <clergy> oy vian
[Feb 2-11 23:35:38]Agnidev <clergy> mobs in lodos temple still not godly
[Feb 15-11 12:43:59]Enska <clergy> Is druid supposed to be only support subclass?
[Feb 15-11 12:57:18]Nulvect <clergy> druids are primarily support, but they do have offensive spells
[Mar 14-11 13:43:33]Morcerf <clergy> cure get changed?
[Mar 14-11 13:43:52]Nulvect <clergy> not recently
[Mar 14-11 13:43:59]Morcerf <clergy> not 100% skill based anymore it seems
[Jul 13-11 11:23:39]Tsabtel <clergy> can you tell me what what lvl the next summons is after assassin? or is that hush info?
[Jul 13-11 11:23:49]Knuckle <clergy> assassin is the last
[Jul 13-11 11:24:6]Tsabtel <clergy> ok, thank you
[Jul 13-11 11:24:42]Knuckle <clergy> i mean im lvl 50 and i only have 4, not sure there are ones after
[Jul 13-11 11:25:18]Tsabtel <clergy> not even 20 so at least i know what to expect hah
[Jul 13-11 11:27:30]Tsabtel <clergy> do they get any sturdier, or they stay frail?
[Jul 13-11 11:28:31]Knuckle <clergy> assassin is the best
[Sep 7-11 1:11:24]Finn <clergy> hail!
[Sep 7-11 1:11:50]Jake <clergy> I love you everything burrito
[Sep 7-11 1:12:8]Finn <clergy> Flip, what the zip?!
[Sep 7-11 1:12:8]Nulvect <clergy> warning: cleric is hard to solo
[Sep 7-11 1:12:25]Finn <clergy> clerics suck!
[Sep 7-11 1:12:38]Finn <clergy> lets be double monks
[Sep 7-11 1:13:24]Jake <clergy> was thinking druid.. and since i only plan on using jake when finn is around might do cleric anyways. I like a challenge
[Sep 7-11 1:48:40]Jake <clergy> having belief and faith seems redundant
[Sep 7-11 1:49:5]Nulvect <clergy> yes, but if I simply remove belief all the clerics who spent exp maxing it at high levels will get @@@#!#
[Sep 7-11 1:49:20]Jake <clergy> true lol
[Sep 7-11 12:53:53]Finn <clergy> feels like my abilities are taking more sp than they should :P
[Sep 8-11 16:16:18]Gob <clergy> Nul these assassin demon rock now! I'm so happyQ
[Sep 8-11 16:35:4]Nulvect <clergy> don't recall making changes to them, but ok
[Sep 13-11 13:41:8]Gob <clergy> woot
[Sep 25-11 12:45:35]Skrymer <clergy> nul im doin insane body damage with whirlwind i think you need to tone me down forreal
[Nov 18-11 8:25:24]Zino <clergy> halll
[Dec 25-11 20:36:52]Skrymer <clergy> noooo competition :(
[Dec 25-11 21:5:41]Skrymer <clergy> i think we need icestorm back :P
[Mar 16-12 13:11:8]Vian <clergy> nice choice :O  which sub you going for
[Mar 16-12 13:11:25]Kermorvan <clergy> kataan most likely, maybe monk.
[Mar 16-12 13:11:57]Kermorvan <clergy> anyway to see class skill list before classing? Didn't see anything on the website
[Mar 16-12 13:12:45]Vian <clergy> hmm
[Mar 16-12 13:12:53]Vian <clergy> I don't believe so
[Mar 16-12 13:13:9]Vian <clergy> Monks are more physical, and kataans are more spells.  Monk is more 1v1 for the most part, and Kataan is AoE.
[Mar 16-12 13:13:28]Vian <clergy> Monks have neat combos (you use 2-3 different abilities in a row, and it is a combo-ability.)
[Mar 16-12 13:13:40]Vian <clergy> For example, you can jab twice for a special, or palmstrike and then circlecick for a different one.
[Mar 16-12 13:52:2]Knuckle <clergy> as you reach elite monks are the perfect balance between physical and magical
[Mar 16-12 13:52:19]Kermorvan <clergy> cool
[Mar 16-12 13:52:42]Kermorvan <clergy> Should I do anything with corpses?
[Mar 16-12 13:52:59]Knuckle <clergy> sacrifice
[Mar 16-12 13:53:22]Knuckle <clergy> help autobag too
[Mar 16-12 13:53:51]Knuckle <clergy> you can buy a backpack from supply shop nw of [] to autobag things into
[Apr 8-12 7:40:37]Yan <clergy> more melee rounds for monks!
[May 25-12 22:56:58]Nulvect <clergy> karas, kataans get impale pretty early on
[May 25-12 23:16:53]Karas <clergy> ok
[Jun 19-12 17:42:38]Demitri <clergy> doh hellfire kills summons
[Jul 6-12 2:56:22]Demitri <clergy> hey Knuck, you know when warpikes AL for us?
[Jul 6-12 2:56:32]Knuckle <clergy> umm not sure, it does for me
