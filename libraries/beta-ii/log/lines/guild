[2-06 18:34:3]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ those guild leaders that come one strictly to pay thier dues and peace out
[2-06 18:34:15]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ are those guilds going to be continued to be run by them?
[2-06 18:34:21]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ yup
[2-06 18:34:31]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ if they want their guilds to keep limping along, thats for them to do
[2-06 18:34:59]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ but....vorticon for instance.....they are not active
[2-06 18:35:3]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ that is obvious
[2-06 18:35:11]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ same with illuminati
[2-06 18:35:25]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ why dont we make new guilds?
[2-06 18:35:35]Endbringer %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ lack of playerbase!
[2-06 18:35:43]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ well yes of course
[2-06 18:35:51]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i think we should have 2 guilds

[2-06 18:40:4]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i love it when i ask a question and get no answers...it is quite fun..
[2-06 18:43:48]Endbringer %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ bah i typed something earlier, must have spelled guild wrong
[2-06 18:43:54]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ sucker
[2-06 18:44:8]Endbringer %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i said that people are probably too attached to their guilds that it probably wouldnt fly well
[2-06 18:44:14]Endbringer %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ and i dont like the good/evil aspect myself
[2-06 18:44:48]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ well all guilds are deemed good or evil, whether or not people like it..different story
[2-06 18:44:56]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ well, if they really want to hold on to their guilds tightly, I'll take that into account in deciding to mak new guilds
[2-06 18:45:16]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ aye
[2-06 18:45:30]Daboura %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ of Illum does get sold, I'm thinking off allowing one more
[2-06 18:45:54]Endbringer %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i mean if you have a good/evil style, then the guilds will more than likely expect you to play like that
[2-06 18:46:2]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ oh illum will be bought
[2-06 18:46:18]Endbringer %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ ill buy it!

[Aug 13-06 22:56:16]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ aye
[Aug 13-06 22:56:38]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ barrage, yeah... I'll be making an eliteish ranged ability too when I get back around to it
[Aug 13-06 22:57:12]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ nods- with the new shoot abils, i really like that we can make arrows now.  b/c it would suck to have to continually get a quiver every 5 seconds

[Nov 3-06 14:48:23]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ 1 - I'm working on becoming more than a "player" on the mud, i have not PKed and i never have looted when i have, so why loot you?
[Nov 3-06 14:48:51]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ 2 - I consider you a friend, and have for a long time, and ying can even tell you, i dont pk friends under no circumstances
[Nov 3-06 14:49:29]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i will regard nemos talk as bs
[Nov 3-06 14:49:45]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ 3 - Unless a guild leader comes to you saying we want a war...don't believe it. I was in rhondale with damien and did nothing to him, he's in DS..if i wanted a war i would have killed him
[Nov 3-06 14:49:47]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ but sometimes even when a cockroach talks to me i start to wonder
[Nov 3-06 14:50:1]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ and i was IN rhondale to help HIM find YOUR corpse snatcher
[Nov 3-06 14:50:35]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ shrug nemo is my blood enemy
[Nov 3-06 14:50:45]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ so if you wish to think ill of me, I'm sorry you feel that way. But i'm one of the most honorable players on this mud and if i dont like you, i say it to your face...I dont beat around the bush and I dont talk behind your back

[Mar 6-07 4:20:33]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i understand that completely
[Mar 6-07 4:21:47]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ if you understand that they are meant almost entirely to be healers and protectors, and NOT as damage deals, then there's nothing more to say about their attack potential
[Mar 6-07 4:21:57]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ s/deals/dealers/
[Mar 6-07 4:22:53]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i was just saying, i think they should be able to start with something, as well as have better skill cost, that was all :\ was just giving an observation
[Mar 6-07 4:23:11]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ they start with heal
[Mar 6-07 4:23:37]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ I'll check on skill costs
[Mar 6-07 4:23:37]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ which does nothing to help them kill a monster -shrugs-
[Mar 6-07 4:23:47]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ I understand what you're saying about heal
[Mar 6-07 4:23:51]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i do
[Mar 6-07 4:24:17]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ it's just the whole starting with no attack spells, makes it harder..that's what I'm tryin to say
[Mar 6-07 4:24:57]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ now, i know and some others know deeds you can do right away to get you to lvl 1 or 2
[Mar 6-07 4:25:3]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ but n00bs dont know thos
[Mar 6-07 4:25:7]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ e
[Mar 6-07 4:25:13]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ yeah, it's a little harder I guess, but mainly because people are stuck on the idea that they must kill to gain exp
[Mar 6-07 4:25:47]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ well aside from the few deeds you can do, you do have to kill to XP
[Mar 6-07 4:25:58]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ to get XP i should say
[Mar 6-07 4:26:23]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ skill costs look fine
[Mar 6-07 4:26:39]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ no, you don't, you can party with people and heal them
[Mar 6-07 4:27:5]Goldenberry %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ if there were more willing people and more mudders yeah i can see that
[Mar 6-07 4:27:9]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ now, the effectiveness of heal and cure might need tweaking
[Mar 12-07 21:37:50]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ nulvect are you busy?
[Mar 12-07 21:38:36]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ not at the moment
[Mar 12-07 21:39:46]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ would you want to help me get this lightning/thunder inherit working correctly?
[Mar 12-07 21:41:42]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ well, depends... do you want to completely understand how it works??
[Mar 12-07 21:42:2]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ because I have something similar already working for my own area, and I could easily edit it for your use
[Mar 12-07 21:42:12]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ but explaining how the whole thing works might take a while
[Mar 12-07 21:42:28]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i'd like to, so i know how to write inherits b/c i'm also working on a wax inherit for guilds
[Mar 12-07 21:42:44]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ but if it's easier for now
[Mar 12-07 21:42:50]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ if you want to just edit it
[Mar 12-07 21:42:58]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ and have mroe time later to explain that's ok
[Mar 12-07 21:43:4]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ but yes, i would like to know how it works
[Mar 12-07 21:43:8]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ ok, tell you what, I'm about to go get something to eat, and after I get back I'll have an hour before heroes is on, so we can go over it during that time
[Mar 12-07 21:43:26]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ heroes is a repeat
[Mar 12-07 21:43:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ what??!!
[Mar 12-07 21:43:44]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ it's not new until the end of april
[Mar 12-07 21:43:58]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ it's all repeats until then
[Mar 12-07 21:44:0]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ argh
[Mar 12-07 21:44:14]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ yeah i'm annoyed too
[Mar 12-07 21:44:28]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ i want to see what happens with peter/seresh/syler
[Mar 12-07 21:44:34]Nulvect %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ bah... well, I'll be back
[Mar 12-07 21:44:40]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ ok, ill talk to you later
[Mar 12-07 21:44:44]Carina %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ thank you
[Mar 26-07 15:31:24]Rohl %^MAGENTA%^<guild>%^RESET%^ I think we need a functioning guild pool again
[Apr 26-07 12:35:29]Carina <guild> hey dabs or nul, i got a divorce from nejaa the other night, and the person was too slow and they got him right when he went link dead, so he's still married to me.. i dont know if that's a bug or anything, i just thought in case, yall should know
[Apr 26-07 12:56:49]Carina <guild> thanks
[May 10-07 11:8:18]Rohl <guild> nul if your on lemme know :O
[May 10-07 11:19:14]Rohl <guild> yo
[May 10-07 11:19:52]Rohl <guild> its been buggin me for awhile now but anyways, why do some guilds have scry pools and others not
[May 10-07 11:21:4]Rohl <guild> how much would one cost?
[May 10-07 11:22:18]Rohl <guild> nobody does :/ thats my problem. i think nobody should have scry pools
[May 10-07 11:23:12]Carina <guild> rohl, may i say what i know about it?
[May 10-07 11:23:16]Carina <guild> it may help
[May 10-07 11:23:20]Rohl <guild> yea
[May 10-07 11:23:44]Carina <guild> scry pools were taken out completely, they were free and unfair
[May 10-07 11:23:54]Rohl <guild> thats what i thought initially
[May 10-07 11:24:8]Carina <guild> then daboura remade them to where they now cost money every time they're used, and only members and up can use them in your guild
[May 10-07 11:24:18]Carina <guild> and then you had to rebuy them for 500k
[May 10-07 11:24:24]Carina <guild> some guilds rebought, some didnt
[May 10-07 11:24:30]Carina <guild> that's why some have them and some dont
[May 10-07 11:24:32]Rohl <guild> well wheres dab
[May 10-07 11:24:40]Rohl <guild> ill give him cash out of my pocket
[May 10-07 11:24:44]Carina <guild> probably at work
[May 10-07 11:24:50]Carina <guild> did i help?
[May 10-07 11:24:58]Rohl <guild> i guess, if it works
[May 10-07 11:25:38]Rohl <guild> i just bet there'll be a catch, that or dab will not deal with anything
[May 10-07 11:26:0]Carina <guild> i think the only thing that could stop it is that no guild can get anything new right now
[May 10-07 11:26:6]Carina <guild> b/c guilds are on hold
[May 10-07 11:26:22]Carina <guild> but something like that may be allowed to be in
[May 10-07 11:26:34]Carina <guild> that is all imm/admin stuff -shrugs-
[May 10-07 11:27:10]Rohl <guild> if my guild isn't allowed to have a scry pool til guilds are off hold, then forsaken and ls or whoever else has pools should lose them til they're not on hold
[May 10-07 11:28:48]Carina <guild> why? b/c the leader of the guild at the time didn't want to buy one?
[May 10-07 11:30:2]Carina <guild> there were posts on the line, on the leader boards and everything..it was well known they could be bought
[May 10-07 11:30:34]Carina <guild> and yet, b/c your guild leader didnt buy one, everything should change b/c you don't have one?
[May 10-07 11:30:42]Carina <guild> i'm just asking, being devils advocate
[May 10-07 11:30:48]Carina <guild> just so you know
[May 10-07 11:31:2]Rohl <guild> its freaking 500k
[May 10-07 11:31:16]Carina <guild> ...what does that have to do with it?
[May 10-07 11:31:20]Carina <guild> that's cheap
[May 10-07 11:31:24]Rohl <guild> duh
[May 10-07 11:31:42]Carina <guild> again, what does that have to do with anything?
[May 10-07 11:31:42]Rohl <guild> when did this take place?
[May 10-07 11:31:46]Carina <guild> like a year ago
[May 10-07 11:33:26]Rohl <guild> Its still not fair, the first get their way and from then out yer screwed til an admin feels like it?
[May 10-07 11:34:16]Carina <guild> when the only person we really have on is nulvect and there is a small player base, unfortunatly...yes
[May 10-07 11:34:42]Carina <guild> there are many things I would change, but when you don't have the power...makes it harder
[May 10-07 11:35:4]Rohl <guild> they are cheap
[May 10-07 11:35:16]Carina <guild> they cost everytime you use them too rohl
[May 10-07 11:35:20]Rohl <guild> eios has like 20 wis and he can scry me
[May 10-07 11:36:24]Rohl <guild> i dont care if they cost 1k every use, its still lame.
[May 10-07 11:36:42]Carina <guild> i agree with nul, but you are only saying something b/c you dont have one
[May 10-07 11:36:50]Carina <guild> so it makes it seem biased
[May 10-07 11:36:54]Rohl <guild> ......no way
[May 10-07 11:37:24]Carina <guild> -shrugs-
[May 10-07 11:37:28]Rohl <guild> of course its about me and my guild
[May 10-07 11:37:44]Rohl <guild> i can have your guild members eyes all over me but we cant look back?
[May 10-07 11:37:46]<guild> Carina had no doubt.
[May 10-07 11:38:16]Carina <guild> that's not my fault
[May 10-07 11:38:40]Carina <guild> that fault goes to whoever owned your guild before
[May 10-07 11:38:48]Carina <guild> and/or ran it
[May 10-07 11:39:37]Rohl <guild> i have to be the eyes for my guild, i have alias's to scry !### near every player
[May 10-07 11:39:57]Rohl <guild> thats how it should be
[May 10-07 11:40:39]Carina <guild> often though, how it should be and how it is...are 2 different things
[May 10-07 11:41:25]Rohl <guild> so wise you are
[May 10-07 11:41:51]Carina <guild> no, not wise...that's common sense
[May 10-07 11:42:9]Rohl <guild> well keep it away from me, i dont lack it
[May 10-07 11:42:47]Carina <guild> rohl, what you have to realize is I'm not being a smartass to you...and I dont think guilds should have scry pools either anymore...I was just playing devils advocate..like i said earlier
[May 10-07 11:43:29]Rohl <guild> nah im just not gonna talk anymore
[May 10-07 11:43:31]Carina <guild> and if they do have scry pools, we should have 1 where everyone can use
[May 10-07 11:43:57]Rohl <guild> every time i talk you act like i dont know what im fighting for, or talking about
[May 10-07 11:44:13]Rohl <guild> imma just talk to whit
[May 10-07 11:44:23]Carina <guild> no i dont, but you can think that if you want -shrugs-
[May 10-07 11:51:25]Rohl <guild> if there were a scry pool that everyone could use, they might as well delete the scry spell
[May 10-07 11:51:39]Rohl <guild> and that would eliminate a bonus to mage/clergy classes:P
[May 10-07 11:51:45]Rohl <guild> which would in turn worsen the mud
[May 10-07 11:54:53]Carina <guild> ok rohl, now I agree with what you say..i know you dont care what i think..but still. the reason you just gave wasn't a selfish reason, it was a good reason, and now i agree with you...even though i technically did before
[May 17-07 1:24:54]Eios <guild> Die !@####!!#!@@@ die !##@#!#@#@!!@ die #!#!!#!#@#@# DIEEE!

[Jun 23-07 23:12:3]Orcha <guild> i wanted the scalp, but he couldnt mount me
[Jun 23-07 23:12:9]Piehl <guild> haha
[Jun 23-07 23:12:15]Piehl <guild> i'll help u get the next one
[Jun 23-07 23:12:21]Orcha <guild> am too lazy to prepare things, i just get them to mount, fly then kill them
[Jun 23-07 23:12:31]Piehl <guild> lol i wish they could mount me
[Jun 23-07 23:12:35]Piehl <guild> i've pk everyday
[Jun 23-07 23:12:41]Piehl <guild> lol
[Jun 23-07 23:12:45]Orcha <guild> its kinda cool, two people can mout me at the same time now :P
[Jun 23-07 23:12:59]Piehl <guild> thats freaking awesome
[Jun 23-07 23:13:17]Orcha <guild> would bt good if two humanoids could mount, but only one centaur/rako
[Jun 23-07 23:13:19]Piehl <guild> oh yeah gotta post my kills
[Jun 23-07 23:13:31]Nulvect <guild> does everything look ok when you have two people on you??
[Jun 23-07 23:13:45]Orcha <guild> yeah, its not too bad
[Jun 23-07 23:14:1]Orcha <guild> havent really had too much of a chnce to test it out fully. but nothing bugs out from what i could remember
[Jun 23-07 23:14:19]Nulvect <guild> good good
[Jun 23-07 23:14:27]Orcha <guild> nice touch nul.
[Jun 23-07 23:14:55]Orcha <guild> could it be done so that one centaur or rako could mount?
[Jun 23-07 23:15:3]Orcha <guild> guess a centaur cant really mount
[Jun 23-07 23:15:11]Orcha <guild> got nothing to hold on with
[Jun 23-07 23:15:11]Nulvect <guild> their legs aren't very well suited to holding on to things
[Jun 23-07 23:15:19]Orcha <guild> what about if i was holding them?
[Jun 23-07 23:15:33]Nulvect <guild> nah
[Jun 23-07 23:15:37]Orcha <guild> nods
[Jun 23-07 23:15:59]Piehl <guild> hmm
[Jun 23-07 23:16:3]Orcha <guild> not holding two, but just one?
[Jun 23-07 23:16:13]Orcha <guild> and with out some one mounted
[Jun 23-07 23:17:57]Nulvect <guild> that would be kind of awkward I would think
[Jun 23-07 23:18:5]Orcha <guild> humm
[Jun 23-07 23:18:19]Orcha <guild> i guess it depends on how you think the dragon looks
[Jun 23-07 23:18:33]Orcha <guild> am going off having 4 legs and wings
[Jun 23-07 23:18:43]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Jun 23-07 23:18:49]Orcha <guild> but i will agree with ya, centaur/rako are kinda big
[Jun 23-07 23:18:51]Piehl <guild> no dragons walk on one leg! lol j/k
[Jun 23-07 23:19:13]<guild> Piehl always imagined older dragons towering over trees...
[Jun 23-07 23:19:21]Orcha <guild> yeah
[Jun 23-07 23:20:1]Orcha <guild> i would say if they could carry a cent/rako etc that it would only be for flying
[Jun 23-07 23:20:11]Orcha <guild> not during combat like mounting
[Jun 23-07 23:20:31]Orcha <guild> fighting while holding some one would be way to hard
[Jun 23-07 23:23:15]Orcha <guild> take care gal and guys
[Jun 23-07 23:23:23]Orcha <guild> this ol black dragon needs to feast
[Jun 23-07 23:23:29]Piehl <guild> night orcha

[Jun 28-07 3:4:35]Nulvect <guild> pfft
[Jun 28-07 3:4:47]<guild> Piehl laughs.
[Jun 30-07 17:58:15]Skunk <guild> who is the guild master right now nul, whit?
[Jun 30-07 17:58:47]Nulvect <guild> him or daos I guess, but nobody really doing anything for guilds
[Jun 30-07 17:59:5]Skunk <guild> yea, that's what i figured, was going to attempt to light a fire under someone...

[Jul 1-07 3:11:51]Carina <guild> i hate it
[Jul 1-07 3:11:57]Orcha <guild> ?
[Jul 1-07 3:12:3]Nulvect <guild> what mud??
[Jul 1-07 3:12:9]Carina <guild> lol
[Jul 1-07 3:12:13]Nulvect <guild> err, sorry, don't mean to butt in :P
[Jul 1-07 3:12:17]Orcha <guild> its a diskworld one.
[Jul 1-07 3:12:37]Orcha <guild> i read a few of his books, so i thought i might have a look at one of the muds. A friend of mine plays it
[Jul 1-07 3:13:29]Carina <guild> you never but in nul, you pretty much run this place
[Jul 1-07 3:14:11]Orcha <guild> hows things
[Jul 1-07 3:14:31]Orcha <guild> the place is freaken huge nul
[Jul 1-07 3:14:41]Orcha <guild> you should see a map of oneof the citys
[Jul 1-07 3:15:21]Carina <guild> what's huge?
[Jul 1-07 3:15:31]Orcha <guild> heh
[Jul 1-07 3:16:17]Nulvect <guild> hmmm
[Jul 1-07 3:16:29]Orcha <guild> you want to see a map of this city nul?
[Jul 1-07 3:16:33]Nulvect <guild> that is one thing we really need, more areas
[Jul 1-07 3:16:37]Nulvect <guild> sure, got an url??
[Jul 1-07 3:16:45]Orcha <guild> umm i think so one sec
[Jul 1-07 3:17:9]Orcha <guild> http://kefka.pride.id.au/maps/Ankh-Morpork.gif
[Jul 1-07 3:19:29]Nulvect <guild> wow
[Jul 1-07 3:19:53]Orcha <guild> big hey
[Jul 1-07 3:20:5]Orcha <guild> its insain to get around
[Jul 1-07 3:20:25]Carina <guild> holy crapoly
[Jul 1-07 3:20:43]Nulvect <guild> I guess it's ok to kill townspeople there?? cause it would take forever just to get out of the city to kill something
[Jul 1-07 3:21:19]Orcha <guild> there is stuff inside the city to kill, but its just too big really
[Jul 1-07 3:21:33]Orcha <guild> hard to navigate
[Jul 1-07 3:21:55]Orcha <guild> i like it here too much
[Jul 1-07 3:22:13]Carina <guild> you'd miss me ... i know i know
[Jul 1-07 3:22:43]Orcha <guild> yeah ofcorse
[Jul 1-07 3:22:51]<guild> Carina licks Orcha
[Jul 1-07 3:23:29]Nulvect <guild> I wouldn't mind tirun having more in it, being the main city and all, but even half that size would be too big...
[Jul 1-07 3:23:41]Orcha <guild> i agree
[Jul 1-07 3:26:7]Carina <guild> i agree as well
[Jul 1-07 3:26:33]Orcha <guild> i thikn its just too big
[Jul 1-07 3:28:25]Carina <guild> it may not be if there are a lot of people, but is for n00bs, doesn't seem n00b friendly
[Jul 1-07 3:28:43]Orcha <guild> i started in that city and its a bit much
[Jul 1-07 3:29:7]Carina <guild> we do need more newbie areas
[Jul 1-07 3:29:25]Carina <guild> mobs that are like in corinthor b/c i know that when i start a new char
[Jul 1-07 3:29:41]Carina <guild> i completly skip the zoo, and the forests
[Jul 1-07 3:29:45]Carina <guild> and go right to corinthor
[Jul 1-07 3:29:47]Orcha <guild> nods
[Jul 1-07 3:29:57]Orcha <guild> cor is a good place to start i think
[Jul 1-07 3:30:3]Carina <guild> yeah
[Jul 1-07 3:30:9]Carina <guild> and that's really the only GOOD newbie area
[Jul 1-07 3:30:21]Carina <guild> maybe once i'm done doing my other things i'll make a newbie area
[Jul 1-07 3:30:29]Carina <guild> a decent sized one
[Jul 1-07 3:31:5]Carina <guild> wow
[Jul 1-07 3:31:17]Carina <guild> dubs was really wanting his chars back
[Jul 1-07 3:31:29]Orcha <guild> ?
[Jul 1-07 3:31:41]Carina <guild> oh i decided to look at the boards around tirun

[Sep 19-07 3:3:44]Amun <guild> list
[Sep 19-07 3:3:52]Amun <guild> forgot more lol
[Sep 20-07 16:51:23]Hepualahaole <guild> hi
[Sep 20-07 16:51:27]Hepualahaole <guild> you mean this one?
[Sep 20-07 16:51:53]Amun <guild> no i meant one that ALL members can see not just leaders b/c more often than not leaders are not on and members are
[Sep 20-07 16:51:59]Hepualahaole <guild> but no one else has it
[Sep 27-07 9:25:55]Ironman <guild> hmmm
[Sep 27-07 9:26:11]Ironman <guild> like i said tho.... should be for any master
[Sep 27-07 9:26:19]Amun <guild> no
[Sep 27-07 9:26:25]<guild> Ironman is ALWAYS here
[Sep 27-07 9:26:31]Amun <guild> and you're not the owner
[Sep 27-07 9:27:23]Amun <guild> the whole guild doesn't get put on trial with this ironman
[Sep 27-07 9:27:27]Amun <guild> just the owner does
[Sep 27-07 9:27:29]Amun <guild> well kinda
[Sep 27-07 9:27:57]Amun <guild> we need active owners..so if cortoth doesnt come on then he will no longer be the owner
[Sep 27-07 9:28:57]Ironman <guild> but its not remotely fair to pass ownership ........ if the person wasnt even around to be warned that their ownership was in danger........
[Sep 27-07 9:29:19]Ironman <guild> i would suggest this
[Sep 27-07 9:29:29]Amun <guild> if someone is not going to show up, for months at a time, then they should not be owner of a guild anyway
[Sep 27-07 9:29:37]Amun <guild> no ironman
[Sep 27-07 9:29:41]Amun <guild> it's staying as is
[Sep 27-07 9:29:55]Ironman <guild> post it clearly on tirun board........ and give 90 day warning....... that would be a fair amount of time for them to drop in and learn of the danger
[Sep 27-07 9:30:7]Ironman <guild> oh i agree amun
[Sep 27-07 9:30:23]Ironman <guild> im just saying most dont even know there IS a guild imm yet
[Sep 27-07 9:30:53]Amun <guild> it's not like the leaders are signing on
[Sep 27-07 9:31:3]Amun <guild> so it's not like any will really know about anything
[Sep 27-07 9:31:59]Ironman <guild> but the top positions are the leaders of the guild.... so they should be offered the title first before it passes to open auction
[Sep 27-07 9:32:17]Ironman <guild> since in most cases they are the ones running things..... it is here in DW anyways
[Sep 27-07 9:32:27]Amun <guild> the top position is guild owner
[Sep 27-07 9:32:39]Ironman <guild> not when i type "members"
[Sep 27-07 9:32:57]Ironman <guild> no position named "guild owner" listed there
[Sep 27-07 9:33:3]Amun <guild> no, not there, but guild owner is top position with common sense
[Sep 27-07 9:33:27]Ironman <guild> its never been posted before now...... and is NOT listed in the membership listing
[Sep 27-07 9:33:45]Amun <guild> help guild list
[Sep 27-07 9:33:47]Ironman <guild> which is why its never been treated that way or cortoth woulda passed it to me
[Sep 27-07 9:33:49]Amun <guild> it lists owners
[Sep 27-07 9:33:53]Ironman <guild> list
[Sep 27-07 9:34:33]Ironman <guild> well vorticon and forsaken i rarely see at all
[Sep 27-07 9:34:47]Ironman <guild> same with bellos
[Sep 27-07 9:34:47]Amun <guild> ok
[Sep 27-07 9:35:25]Amun <guild> you're only proving my point more on why we need new owners
[Sep 27-07 9:35:49]Ironman <guild> my position is that those in the top tier should be able to assume the role if the listed "owner" is not available
[Sep 27-07 9:36:19]Ironman <guild> or not willing to fullfil the role
[Sep 27-07 9:37:9]Ironman <guild> perhaps even let the membership body of the guild vote on who they want as active leader
[Sep 27-07 9:37:19]Amun <guild> and THAT is what will happen
[Sep 27-07 9:37:27]Ironman <guild> ok
[Sep 27-07 9:37:27]Amun <guild> it's already all been put together
[Sep 27-07 9:37:33]Ironman <guild> that i can live with
[Sep 27-07 9:37:41]Amun <guild> but i do appreciate your approval on my decisions
[Sep 27-07 9:37:47]Ironman <guild> thought you were just gonna sell the guild out from under everyone......
[Sep 27-07 9:37:53]Amun <guild> heck no
[Sep 27-07 9:37:59]Amun <guild> i was a guild owner once ironman
[Sep 27-07 9:38:3]Amun <guild> and if someone did that to me
[Sep 27-07 9:38:3]Ironman <guild> then i misunderstood hon
[Sep 27-07 9:38:11]Amun <guild> i'd have been so !##@!#
[Sep 27-07 9:38:13]Amun <guild> whoops
[Sep 27-07 9:38:15]Amun <guild> mad
[Sep 27-07 9:38:29]Ironman <guild> i donty see why this line is filtered......
[Sep 27-07 9:38:45]Ironman <guild> anyone on this like would have been playing for like ages :P
[Sep 27-07 9:39:21]Ironman <guild> i say we just let the membership elect a new owner...... which is what you said is gonna happen
[Sep 27-07 9:39:37]Amun <guild> lol
[Sep 27-07 9:40:3]Ironman <guild> that makes sense.... selling the guild doesnt unless its totally vacent of active people
[Sep 27-07 9:40:29]Amun <guild> indeed, which is why it wont happen unless that's the case
[Sep 27-07 9:40:37]Amun <guild> dont worry ironman...i know what i'm doing
[Sep 27-07 14:24:16]Skunk <guild> list
[Sep 27-07 14:28:14]Skunk <guild> new posts
[Sep 27-07 19:33:51]Amun <guild> if you have any more questions or concerns i'm here
[Sep 27-07 19:33:57]Amun <guild> and more than willing to liste
[Sep 27-07 19:33:59]Amun <guild> n
[Sep 27-07 19:34:11]Skunk <guild> i do, and i am going to post them so that all can be a part of the conversation
[Sep 27-07 19:34:23]Amun <guild> ok
[Sep 27-07 19:42:19]Skunk <guild> new post
[Sep 27-07 19:51:33]Skunk <guild> i think that if they do get put on probation then 5 months of on time payments would be sufficient to take them off probation
[Sep 27-07 19:51:51]Skunk <guild> and we are talking mud months not irl months correct?
[Sep 27-07 19:52:41]Amun <guild> that's correct
[Sep 27-07 19:52:47]Amun <guild> i think that would be fair
[Sep 27-07 19:53:3]Amun <guild> the point of these dues are different than the dues before
[Sep 27-07 19:53:9]Amun <guild> that's why they're cheaper
[Sep 27-07 19:53:17]Amun <guild> i'm not looking to take guilds away
[Sep 27-07 19:53:35]Amun <guild> i'm looking to make them more active
[Sep 27-07 19:53:37]Skunk <guild> the dues before were every mud month
[Sep 27-07 19:53:51]Amun <guild> yes, as are these
[Sep 27-07 19:54:7]Skunk <guild> and if you can't come up with 10k a month for dues, then your guild doesn't deserve to exist
[Sep 27-07 19:54:9]Amun <guild> but the reason for them was to see which guilds were active and where were not
[Sep 27-07 19:54:23]Amun <guild> well, i lowered the dues b/c i dont want your money
[Sep 27-07 19:54:29]Amun <guild> i want activity
[Sep 27-07 19:54:39]Amun <guild> which i'm going to talk to whit tonight about more things
[Sep 27-07 19:54:39]Skunk <guild> still the larger the amount, the more activity you will hace
[Sep 27-07 19:54:43]Skunk <guild> have
[Sep 27-07 19:55:1]Amun <guild> and i'm looking to add stuff and change stuff in existing guilds
[Sep 27-07 19:55:3]Skunk <guild> if you actually have to work to keep your guild... then it makes it more active
[Sep 27-07 19:55:25]Amun <guild> well, yes but right now i'm looking for owners that will help guilds build up
[Sep 27-07 19:55:31]Amun <guild> b/c as i'm sure you've noticed
[Sep 27-07 19:55:37]Amun <guild> it's a DS game
[Sep 27-07 19:55:51]Amun <guild> sure there are some ls and some dw and you're the only unholy
[Sep 27-07 19:55:55]Amun <guild> but other than that...
[Sep 27-07 19:55:57]Amun <guild> it's ds
[Sep 27-07 19:56:1]Skunk <guild> there isn't enough player base to have more then 2 or 3 guilds here
[Sep 27-07 19:56:9]Amun <guild> i know, which is another reason for this
[Sep 27-07 19:56:17]Amun <guild> if there is no one in the guild to take it over
[Sep 27-07 19:56:23]Amun <guild> the guild will not be deleted
[Sep 27-07 19:56:25]Amun <guild> BUT
[Sep 27-07 19:56:25]Skunk <guild> if you want to stir things up, take all guilds out and start fresh
[Sep 27-07 19:56:31]Amun <guild> it will be shut down
[Sep 27-07 19:56:35]Amun <guild> you know skunk i want to
[Sep 27-07 19:56:39]Amun <guild> very badly
[Sep 27-07 19:56:41]Skunk <guild> start an application process and let people do it
[Sep 27-07 19:56:53]Amun <guild> but you know how much people will complain about that?
[Sep 27-07 19:57:3]Amun <guild> i would love nothing more than to take it all and start all over
[Sep 27-07 19:57:39]Amun <guild> people would say "i put money in and i bought a guild why should i pay again?"
[Sep 27-07 19:58:1]Amun <guild> when in all honesty, the only one that has really paid for a guild was Carina
[Sep 27-07 19:58:5]Amun <guild> and she bought 2
[Sep 27-07 19:58:15]Amun <guild> everyone was handed the guilds
[Sep 27-07 19:58:27]Amun <guild> so i would love nothing more than to start fresh
[Sep 27-07 19:58:35]Amun <guild> but i dont think people would take to that
[Sep 27-07 19:58:57]Amun <guild> take all the guilded money and combine it all together
[Sep 27-07 19:59:3]Amun <guild> and make a fund for new guilds
[Sep 27-07 19:59:13]Amun <guild> as a base
[Sep 27-07 19:59:15]Skunk <guild> give refunds to the current guild owners
[Sep 27-07 19:59:35]Amun <guild> well no current guild owner paid for their guild
[Sep 27-07 19:59:43]Amun <guild> save eios
[Sep 27-07 19:59:45]Skunk <guild> no, but they were given the guild
[Sep 27-07 19:59:53]Skunk <guild> so the person who did pay for it
[Sep 27-07 20:0:9]Amun <guild> so you're saying original guild owners?
[Sep 27-07 20:0:21]Amun <guild> none of them play the game nor care what happens here
[Sep 27-07 20:1:5]Amun <guild> what i would think would be fair is put the money together and give each new guild an equal share to get them started
[Sep 27-07 20:1:45]Amun <guild> if people try to take their guilds money, it would just hinder them when trying to buy a guild, plus i'd be able to see it and they would lose that money
[Sep 27-07 20:2:43]Skunk <guild> sorry, i'm at work and have to idle sometimes
[Sep 27-07 20:2:55]Amun <guild> no need to apologize
[Sep 27-07 20:3:9]Amun <guild> i'm making a guild town
[Sep 27-07 20:3:11]Skunk <guild> the original owner that paid for the guild, said, i'm not gonna be around, you take the guild
[Sep 27-07 20:3:25]Amun <guild> no, they just never show up
[Sep 27-07 20:3:37]Amun <guild> no original owners ever come on
[Sep 27-07 20:3:41]Amun <guild> never*
[Sep 27-07 20:3:45]Skunk <guild> so whoever the current owner is, has acceptance from the original owner, through however many owners it has passed down through
[Sep 27-07 20:3:59]Skunk <guild> so it would make sense to give the refund to the current owner
[Sep 27-07 20:4:11]Skunk <guild> take ds for example
[Sep 27-07 20:4:17]Skunk <guild> who was the owner before res?
[Sep 27-07 20:4:23]Skunk <guild> vyce?
[Sep 27-07 20:4:25]Amun <guild> i dont think anyone that did not pay for their guild should get the money
[Sep 27-07 20:4:33]Amun <guild> to be honest, i have no idea
[Sep 27-07 20:4:39]Skunk <guild> think of it like hand me down clothes
[Sep 27-07 20:4:55]Skunk <guild> your older brother gives you some clothes, then you give them to your younger brother
[Sep 27-07 20:5:1]Amun <guild> nods-
[Sep 27-07 20:5:5]Skunk <guild> you younger brother can sell the clothes and get the money
[Sep 27-07 20:5:17]Skunk <guild> because it is his, given to him
[Sep 27-07 20:5:33]Amun <guild> but we're not talking about selling the guilds, we're talking about taking them
[Sep 27-07 20:5:35]Skunk <guild> so basically it would be like me saying i'm not going to play anymore, here take all my money
[Sep 27-07 20:5:53]Skunk <guild> yea, but what i'm saying is give the current owner a certain percentage of the cost of the guild
[Sep 27-07 20:6:3]Skunk <guild> then let them reapply
[Sep 27-07 20:6:17]Amun <guild> i understand what you're saying, i just dont think people that did nothing for the guild should get money for it
[Sep 27-07 20:6:21]Amun <guild> for instance
[Sep 27-07 20:6:25]Amun <guild> last saints
[Sep 27-07 20:6:31]Amun <guild> i bought it with my own money
[Sep 27-07 20:6:35]Amun <guild> i am no an imm
[Sep 27-07 20:6:45]Amun <guild> so the guild went to piehl b/c i appointed him
[Sep 27-07 20:7:1]Amun <guild> but before that time he didnt do anything for the guild, didnt even give money to the guild
[Sep 27-07 20:7:5]Skunk <guild> yea, but that's like saying if your parents give you a car, and you sell it, you shouldn't get the money...
[Sep 27-07 20:7:7]Amun <guild> so why should he recieve money
[Sep 27-07 20:7:31]Amun <guild> but guilds are for sale
[Sep 27-07 20:7:33]Skunk <guild> make it guild credits then, only usable for reapplying to open a guild
[Sep 27-07 20:7:45]Amun <guild> we're not selling them, we're taking them out
[Sep 27-07 20:7:59]Amun <guild> that's what i was saying
[Sep 27-07 20:8:1]Skunk <guild> yea, but when you take them out, you are going to put new ones in
[Sep 27-07 20:8:11]Amun <guild> all the guild treasuries would be combined
[Sep 27-07 20:8:27]Skunk <guild> say that if you are a current owner, you can have a 75% discount on the price of a new guild or something
[Sep 27-07 20:8:29]Amun <guild> and then however many guilds emerge they would get an equal amount of it
[Sep 27-07 20:8:47]Skunk <guild> i don't think it should be spread out to whoever reapplys
[Sep 27-07 20:8:57]Amun <guild> no not to everyone that reapplies
[Sep 27-07 20:9:1]Skunk <guild> say i'm not part of a guild at all, i apply for a new guild, why should i et a chunk of that money?
[Sep 27-07 20:9:23]Amun <guild> so you think it should stay with the people that were in guilds, rather than open to everyone?
[Sep 27-07 20:9:45]Skunk <guild> i think that new guilds should be open to everyone
[Sep 27-07 20:9:53]Skunk <guild> but discounts should be for current guild owners
[Sep 27-07 20:10:15]Amun <guild> i'm talking about the guild treasury money...i think you're talking about pricing?
[Sep 27-07 20:10:19]Amun <guild> ok pricing
[Sep 27-07 20:10:25]Amun <guild> yes, a discount could be given
[Sep 27-07 20:10:31]Skunk <guild> i'm talking about pricing
[Sep 27-07 20:10:39]Amun <guild> nods-
[Sep 27-07 20:11:1]Skunk <guild> as far as guild treasury money, are you talking about individual guild treasury or the general guild fund?
[Sep 27-07 20:11:21]Amun <guild> general guild fund
[Sep 27-07 20:12:31]Skunk <guild> eh, who cares about that
[Sep 27-07 20:12:37]Skunk <guild> that is only 4.5 mil
[Sep 27-07 20:12:41]Skunk <guild> pocket change
[Sep 27-07 20:12:49]Amun <guild> not if you combine all guilds
[Sep 27-07 20:13:5]Skunk <guild> so the balance i see is not for all guilds?
[Sep 27-07 20:13:9]Amun <guild> it's considerablly more if you combine all guilds
[Sep 27-07 20:13:19]Amun <guild> no balance is for all guilds...
[Sep 27-07 20:13:27]Skunk <guild> ok, i see 4.5 mil
[Sep 27-07 20:13:27]Amun <guild> ok i dont think you understand what i'm saying
[Sep 27-07 20:13:35]Skunk <guild> there are two guild accounts
[Sep 27-07 20:13:39]Skunk <guild> on is for unholy
[Sep 27-07 20:13:43]Skunk <guild> one is for all
[Sep 27-07 20:13:53]Amun <guild> every guild has a guild treasury
[Sep 27-07 20:13:59]Skunk <guild> for just the guild
[Sep 27-07 20:14:11]Amun <guild> THAT'S what i'm saying combine
[Sep 27-07 20:14:19]Skunk <guild> i strongly disagree
[Sep 27-07 20:14:29]Amun <guild> and what should happen to it?
[Sep 27-07 20:14:43]Skunk <guild> let the current leaders/owners decide
[Sep 27-07 20:14:57]Amun <guild> so they could keep it all for themselves
[Sep 27-07 20:15:5]Amun <guild> which is more than likely what would happen
[Sep 27-07 20:15:7]Skunk <guild> when that money was donated to the guild, who ever donated it left in the hands of the owners and leaders
[Sep 27-07 20:15:15]Skunk <guild> so why change that
[Sep 27-07 20:15:19]Amun <guild> that's true
[Sep 27-07 20:15:21]Skunk <guild> let the owners/leaders decide
[Sep 27-07 20:15:51]Skunk <guild> but if you want a more active guild system, you need to cut the number of guilds down
[Sep 27-07 20:15:53]Skunk <guild> a lot
[Sep 27-07 20:15:59]Amun <guild> i agree big time
[Sep 27-07 20:16:1]Amun <guild> big time
[Sep 27-07 20:16:5]Skunk <guild> so start hacking
[Sep 27-07 20:16:15]Skunk <guild> who cares if people complain
[Sep 27-07 20:16:27]Skunk <guild> an imm should have a thick enough skin to handle the heat
[Sep 27-07 20:16:35]Amun <guild> i need permission to do it all
[Sep 27-07 20:16:39]Amun <guild> i cant just do it
[Sep 27-07 20:16:41]Skunk <guild> well that is on you
[Sep 27-07 20:16:49]Skunk <guild> but don't look for acceptance from the player base
[Sep 27-07 20:17:3]Amun <guild> i didnt before lol
[Sep 27-07 20:17:23]Skunk <guild> and don't balk, if you start something finish it
[Sep 27-07 20:17:33]Amun <guild> i plan on it
[Sep 27-07 20:17:47]Skunk <guild> it will be interesting to see what happens
[Sep 27-07 20:18:11]Amun <guild> to say the least
[Sep 27-07 20:18:25]Skunk <guild> are you going through stormy or whit?
[Sep 27-07 20:18:29]Skunk <guild> who is your boss?
[Sep 27-07 20:18:31]Amun <guild> whit
[Sep 27-07 20:18:45]Amun <guild> well both are, but going through whit mostly
[Sep 27-07 20:18:47]Skunk <guild> and whit will have to clear it with stormy i'm guessing?
[Sep 27-07 20:18:53]Amun <guild> no
[Sep 27-07 20:19:27]Skunk <guild> i vote for hacking them all out and redo em with 2 maybe (a big maybe) 3 guilds
[Sep 27-07 20:19:45]Amun <guild> i want to do 2, one good, one bad
[Sep 27-07 20:19:57]Amun <guild> so to speak
[Sep 27-07 20:20:5]Skunk <guild> yea... cause we don't have that already with demons and angels...
[Sep 27-07 20:20:21]Skunk <guild> let the guilds decide what to be, don't try to micro manage
[Sep 27-07 20:20:31]Amun <guild> shrugs-
[Sep 27-07 20:20:35]Skunk <guild> you are a guild imm, not a guild leader
[Sep 27-07 20:20:47]Amun <guild> i know
[Sep 27-07 20:20:55]Skunk <guild> so it would be unfair for you try to form a guild into what you think it should be
[Sep 27-07 20:21:3]Amun <guild> touche
[Sep 27-07 20:21:41]Skunk <guild> in the past i've had to submit full on mission statements, background history, and guild hall plans to get approval for a guild
[Sep 27-07 20:21:53]Amun <guild> nods-
[Sep 27-07 20:21:57]Skunk <guild> just some ideas if you do hack them all out
[Sep 27-07 20:22:17]Skunk <guild> maybe say a player has to be active for 5 or 6 months before they can apply for a guild
[Sep 27-07 20:22:25]<guild> Nulvect hacks Skunk into a cat
[Sep 27-07 20:22:33]Skunk <guild> and elite maybe, or have some sort of test to show mud knowledge
[Sep 27-07 20:22:35]Skunk <guild> heya nul
[Sep 27-07 20:23:49]Amun <guild> its something to consider
[Sep 27-07 20:23:57]Skunk <guild> hows things in the bay nul?
[Sep 27-07 20:24:9]Nulvect <guild> bit warm for my tastes
[Sep 27-07 20:24:17]Skunk <guild> aye, then don't come visit me ;)
[Sep 27-07 20:24:23]Skunk <guild> it's hot, and humid
[Sep 27-07 20:24:37]Skunk <guild> but at least the ocean is 10 minutes away
[Sep 27-07 20:24:47]Skunk <guild> and not the bay type ocean, the good kind ;)
[Sep 27-07 20:26:59]Skunk <guild> anyway, back to work
[Sep 27-07 20:27:1]Skunk <guild> laters
[Sep 28-07 16:58:35]A shadow <guild> list
[Sep 28-07 16:58:39]A shadow <guild> oops
[Sep 29-07 18:59:58]Damien <guild> mornin resolution ;)

[Sep 29-07 19:13:49]Amun <guild> well i'm done checkin actually
[Sep 29-07 19:14:3]Amun <guild> which one were you meaning?
[Sep 29-07 19:14:9]Damien <guild> resos
[Sep 29-07 19:17:9]Skunk <guild> yes?
[Sep 29-07 19:17:21]Amun <guild> tells please
[Sep 29-07 19:27:7]Skunk <guild> yea, i can't use it now
[Sep 29-07 19:27:15]Amun <guild> kk thank you again skunk
[Oct 2-07 9:12:8]Ironman <guild> thats what i ment tho........
[Oct 2-07 9:12:18]Ironman <guild> people not taking the roster seriously.....
[Oct 2-07 9:12:36]A shadow <guild> he was stupid enough last night to get kicked out of two guilds, he don't have this line either
[Oct 2-07 9:12:50]Ironman <guild> hence why i used it :P
[Oct 2-07 9:48:42]Ironman <guild> idiots.......
[Oct 2-07 23:18:43]Damien <guild> waste a gate... holy crap is he serious?
[Oct 2-07 23:18:59]Damien <guild> it's not like we are limited in the number we can use
[Oct 2-07 23:19:28]Sesshoumaru <guild> Mebbe hes just mp stingy
[Oct 2-07 23:19:49]Damien <guild> we are mages... we have an asston of mp
[Oct 2-07 23:19:57]Sesshoumaru <guild> good mages,aye
[Oct 2-07 23:20:1]Sesshoumaru <guild> lame ones dont lol
[Oct 2-07 23:20:11]Damien <guild> lame mages don't deserve gate...
[Oct 2-07 23:20:27]Sesshoumaru <guild> Go tell that on a mountain
[Oct 2-07 23:20:29]Damien <guild> and it's not like it's hard to regen mp either
[Oct 2-07 23:20:37]Sesshoumaru <guild> rub stone is uber easy
[Oct 2-07 23:20:51]Sesshoumaru <guild> not like on some other muds where you have to wait 15 mins for mp regen
[Oct 2-07 23:20:55]Damien <guild> gate should only be allowed if you have 100+ wis and 100+intel
[Oct 2-07 23:21:3]Sesshoumaru <guild> i think so too
[Oct 2-07 23:21:7]Damien <guild> seriously, how hard is swing head
[Oct 2-07 23:21:45]Damien <guild> i remember when i had my first mage, i asked daboura why we had boost, and he said good idea and took it away, people were !#!@@! at me
[Oct 2-07 23:21:55]Damien <guild> oops, they were mad
[Oct 2-07 23:21:59]Sesshoumaru <guild> lol
[Oct 2-07 23:22:9]Sesshoumaru <guild> dont feel bad bro,the filter freakin hates me too
[Oct 2-07 23:22:19]Damien <guild> but seriously a mage with boost? come on
[Oct 2-07 23:22:21]Sesshoumaru <guild> I get whole lines of !@!@@!! sometimes lol
[Oct 2-07 23:22:25]Damien <guild> hehe
[Oct 2-07 23:22:41]Sesshoumaru <guild> a mage boosting doesnt mage much sense
[Oct 2-07 23:22:43]Sesshoumaru <guild> unless
[Oct 2-07 23:22:47]Sesshoumaru <guild> its a healer mage
[Oct 2-07 23:22:53]Damien <guild> which we don't have
[Oct 2-07 23:22:53]Sesshoumaru <guild> make*
[Oct 2-07 23:23:1]Sesshoumaru <guild> yeah,i noticed the lack thereof
[Oct 2-07 23:23:7]Sesshoumaru <guild> after i mentioned it lol
[Oct 2-07 23:23:13]Damien <guild> i would however love to see a conjuring mage :D
[Oct 2-07 23:23:27]Sesshoumaru <guild> they have one of those on the other mud i play
[Oct 2-07 23:23:33]Sesshoumaru <guild> tis a quest class
[Oct 2-07 23:23:37]Damien <guild> they had one on my old mud that went under, wicked fun
[Oct 2-07 23:23:41]Sesshoumaru <guild> only one person has figured it out
[Oct 2-07 23:23:51]Sesshoumaru <guild> think the actual class is called
[Oct 2-07 23:23:55]Sesshoumaru <guild> illusionist
[Oct 2-07 23:23:59]Damien <guild> rad
[Oct 2-07 23:23:59]Sesshoumaru <guild> all conuring magics
[Oct 2-07 23:24:5]Sesshoumaru <guild> conjuring*
[Oct 2-07 23:24:9]Damien <guild> didn't we used to have one of those on here?
[Oct 2-07 23:24:17]Sesshoumaru <guild> Im not really sure man
[Oct 2-07 23:24:23]Amun <guild> cheese
[Oct 2-07 23:24:25]Damien <guild> an illusionist class, i think so, back on pdI
[Oct 2-07 23:24:29]Sesshoumaru <guild> Ive been holding my breath on vampire since i got here lol
[Oct 2-07 23:24:33]Damien <guild> keep holding
[Oct 2-07 23:24:55]<guild> Sesshoumaru wants to be a vamp pretty bad.
[Oct 2-07 23:24:57]Damien <guild> i really want to play a lich
[Oct 2-07 23:24:59]<guild> Sesshoumaru prods Amun.
[Oct 2-07 23:25:7]Nulvect <guild> not to diss other muds, but that class is not very well named, half their stuff is conjuring, and conjuring != illusion
[Oct 2-07 23:25:7]Damien <guild> so dab makes himself a lich to spite me... :(
[Oct 2-07 23:25:15]Amun <guild> once i'm done doing the major things with guilds, i will start back up on vampire
[Oct 2-07 23:25:33]Damien <guild> so in 5-6 years... :P
[Oct 2-07 23:25:35]Sesshoumaru <guild> Thats hot
[Oct 2-07 23:25:41]<guild> Sesshoumaru will be a vamp one day!
[Oct 2-07 23:25:49]Amun <guild> not 5 - 6 years no lol
[Oct 2-07 23:25:57]Sesshoumaru <guild> 7-8?
[Oct 2-07 23:26:3]Amun <guild> try 100
[Oct 2-07 23:26:5]Amun <guild> ;)
[Oct 2-07 23:26:11]<guild> Sesshoumaru frowns!
[Oct 2-07 23:26:17]Amun <guild> i'll be 124 the day it goes in
[Oct 2-07 23:26:29]Damien <guild> oh sure... speak of the devil and he will appear
[Oct 2-07 23:26:35]Damien <guild> daboura you suck :P
[Oct 2-07 23:26:39]Sesshoumaru <guild> lol
[Oct 2-07 23:26:55]Daboura <guild> I'm always watching :P
[Oct 2-07 23:27:5]Damien <guild> lies from the lips of your mouth...
[Oct 2-07 23:28:11]Damien <guild> hey dabs, do me a favor?
[Oct 2-07 23:28:17]Damien <guild> finish up lich, thanks :D
[Oct 2-07 23:28:19]Daboura <guild> nope
[Oct 2-07 23:28:27]Damien <guild> scrooge :P

[Oct 2-07 23:29:18]Daboura <guild> never?>

[Oct 2-07 23:29:20]Sesshoumaru <guild> Those guys have all kinds of stuff these days
[Oct 2-07 23:29:40]Damien <guild> the only thing close to best buy on this island is costco...
[Oct 2-07 23:29:40]Sesshoumaru <guild> More dvd's than blockbuster
[Oct 2-07 23:30:10]Damien <guild> or walmart... *shudder*
[Oct 2-07 23:30:14]Sesshoumaru <guild> Ugh
[Oct 2-07 23:30:18]Sesshoumaru <guild> Walmart
[Oct 2-07 23:30:26]Damien <guild> price of living in paradise i guess...

[Oct 6-07 1:53:30]Luna <guild> i think so
[Oct 10-07 19:25:52]Ironman <guild> posted on guild board
[Oct 10-07 19:49:55]Ironman <guild> they increase the command count and increase areas........ then we can sell this place on newbies
[Oct 10-07 19:50:19]Sesshoumaru <guild> i dont think its just that really
[Oct 10-07 19:50:27]Sesshoumaru <guild> something seems off,but i cant place my finger on it
[Oct 10-07 19:50:31]Ironman <guild> its one of the main things tho
[Oct 10-07 19:50:51]Ironman <guild> i get told the same thing when i bring someone here and they leave....... lack of commands
[Oct 10-07 19:51:15]Sesshoumaru <guild> most of the peeps i bring leave because of lack of peeps to party with
[Oct 10-07 19:51:28]Ironman <guild> that too
[Oct 10-07 19:51:43]Ironman <guild> but solving the two issues i brought up would solve that issue
[Oct 10-07 19:52:3]Sesshoumaru <guild> i mean,you spend a week straight playing pd and youve met nearly everyone that plays lol
[Oct 10-07 19:52:17]<guild> Ironman snickers
[Oct 10-07 19:52:45]Sesshoumaru <guild> =D
[Oct 14-07 19:38:26]Furiae <guild> hi luna
[Oct 16-07 1:58:46]Skunk <guild> so what is hapening to the other guilds?
[Oct 16-07 1:59:8]Noxus <guild> this is the new guild leader line??
[Oct 16-07 1:59:10]Amun <guild> blacksails and illuminati?
[Oct 16-07 1:59:16]Skunk <guild> ayep
[Oct 16-07 1:59:16]Amun <guild> no noxus
[Oct 16-07 1:59:20]Amun <guild> this isnt new lol
[Oct 16-07 1:59:26]Amun <guild> it's the guild leader line
[Oct 16-07 1:59:42]Skunk <guild> is it just leaders or for the second tier as well?
[Oct 16-07 1:59:48]Amun <guild> just leaders
[Oct 16-07 1:59:54]<guild> Skunk nods.
[Oct 16-07 2:0:14]Noxus <guild> this is where we decide who to destroy i guess :\
[Oct 16-07 2:0:44]Amun <guild> or ask general guild questions etc etc
[Oct 16-07 2:1:0]Skunk <guild> so when can we apply for additions and such, and are the guild help files up to date?
[Oct 16-07 2:2:0]Amun <guild> no to the guild help files and no additions, i'm in the middle of building something that is going to change guilds
[Oct 16-07 2:2:10]<guild> Skunk nods.
[Oct 16-07 2:2:22]Amun <guild> which will be kinda..one big addon hmm lol
[Oct 16-07 2:2:42]Skunk <guild> would just like to get unholy kinda up to par with the other guilds
[Oct 16-07 2:2:54]Noxus <guild> what is unholy missing
[Oct 16-07 2:2:58]Skunk <guild> a lot
[Oct 16-07 2:2:58]Noxus <guild> *tries to compare*
[Oct 16-07 2:3:18]Noxus <guild> actually forsaken isn't that bad off
[Oct 16-07 2:3:22]Skunk <guild> no scry pool, no waxes, no eq other then gauntlets, no stones, or ointment
[Oct 16-07 2:3:38]Skunk <guild> no bags
[Oct 16-07 2:3:46]Skunk <guild> no lockers
[Oct 16-07 2:3:58]Noxus <guild> ahh ok so you are pretty dang crappy :p
[Oct 16-07 2:4:4]Skunk <guild> basically all we have are oils, gauntlets, and uhhh a treasury...
[Oct 16-07 2:4:4]Noxus <guild> and btw no 1 has waxes
[Oct 16-07 2:4:12]Amun <guild> oh btw yes they do
[Oct 16-07 2:4:12]Skunk <guild> those were taken out?
[Oct 16-07 2:4:18]Noxus <guild> who does??
[Oct 16-07 2:4:24]Skunk <guild> i know ls used to
[Oct 16-07 2:4:24]Amun <guild> well now only one guild
[Oct 16-07 2:4:32]Noxus <guild> lastsaints don't work
[Oct 16-07 2:4:34]Amun <guild> there was more than one, now it's just the one
[Oct 16-07 2:4:38]Amun <guild> and yes they do
[Oct 16-07 2:4:44]Amun <guild> they're just more rare than a diamond lol
[Oct 16-07 2:4:50]Skunk <guild> would be nice if you would give the smaller guilds a chance to get up to snuff with the other guilds
[Oct 16-07 2:5:2]Amun <guild> skunk, again, no addons
[Oct 16-07 2:5:4]Skunk <guild> would be more then happy to pay for the upgrades
[Oct 16-07 2:5:16]Amun <guild> guilds have have more right now will be losing
[Oct 16-07 2:5:24]Amun <guild> guilds that have nothing now will be gaining
[Oct 16-07 2:5:32]Amun <guild> just be patient please
[Oct 16-07 2:5:48]Amun <guild> i AM working on it and it's almost finished
[Oct 16-07 2:5:54]<guild> Skunk would just like to see some equality
[Oct 16-07 2:6:12]Amun <guild> yes, b/c i think things shouldn't be equal ;)
[Oct 16-07 2:6:18]Noxus <guild> im just glad to see a big step in guild changes
[Oct 16-07 2:6:22]Skunk <guild> so why aren't they?
[Oct 16-07 2:6:22]Amun <guild> which is why i'm saying some will lose some will gain lol
[Oct 16-07 2:6:32]Nulvect <guild> when there's a single area for all guilds to have stuff put in, it'll be pretty equal...
[Oct 16-07 2:6:35]Amun <guild> they aren'y right now
[Oct 16-07 2:7:48]Amun <guild> well since nul let the cat out lol
[Oct 16-07 2:7:54]Amun <guild> i'm making a guild town
[Oct 16-07 2:8:20]Amun <guild> and in it will be the "addons" minus certain things that will be strictly guild oriented
[Oct 16-07 2:8:40]Noxus <guild> a guild town??
[Oct 16-07 2:8:42]Amun <guild> yes
[Oct 16-07 2:8:54]Amun <guild> and skunk actually, the post you had
[Oct 16-07 2:8:58]Amun <guild> that stormy answered
[Oct 16-07 2:9:2]Skunk <guild> so all guilds will share the same shops and areas?
[Oct 16-07 2:9:8]Amun <guild> at the leader board, that all has to do with the guild town
[Oct 16-07 2:9:12]Amun <guild> no
[Oct 16-07 2:9:24]Amun <guild> like i said some things will remain in the guild
[Oct 16-07 2:9:32]Amun <guild> the shops like armour/weapon
[Oct 16-07 2:9:36]Amun <guild> will be in the guild hall
[Oct 16-07 2:10:28]Amun <guild> but once it's done more will be revealed
[Oct 16-07 2:10:42]Amun <guild> until then just know guilds will be balanced
[Oct 16-07 2:10:54]Skunk <guild> but they won't be balanced until then?
[Oct 16-07 2:11:22]Amun <guild> you're idea of balanced is give your guild more items, from what I'm gathering, is this correct?
[Oct 16-07 2:11:52]Skunk <guild> either let the other guilds purchase items to get on the same level as the other guilds, or take items away from guilds that have more, your choice
[Oct 16-07 2:12:4]Skunk <guild> i've been trying for years now to get more stuff for unholy
[Oct 16-07 2:12:12]Amun <guild> why would we allow guilds to purchase items when guilds are completely changing?
[Oct 16-07 2:12:32]Amun <guild> it's a waste of not only your gold, but also our time when it's all changing anyway
[Oct 16-07 2:12:38]Skunk <guild> why would you leave items in for some guilds when things are completely changing?
[Oct 16-07 2:13:20]Amun <guild> b/c if they've been there this long, and they're not good items anyway, why take the time to take them out, when that time can be spend working on the future of guilds?
[Oct 16-07 2:15:20]Amun <guild> nothing is being taken out yet, and nothing is being added in until other things are finished.  There is a guild immortal now, where there wasn't before.  I assure you, I am working hard to get things changed as quickly as possible for guilds.
[Oct 16-07 2:15:48]Skunk <guild> i just figured since you took out everything at the begining the point was to balance things out
[Oct 16-07 2:15:50]Amun <guild> so that things are equal.  I ask that you please just be patient, as I do work and go to school full time
[Oct 16-07 2:16:2]Amun <guild> not all the healing items were balanced
[Oct 16-07 2:16:16]Amun <guild> some were hand made and not using the write inherits
[Oct 16-07 2:16:30]Amun <guild> so they had to be changed, and as you know, they are now back in
[Oct 16-07 2:16:59]Skunk <guild> but items like waxes, stones, oils, and ointments, will those be changing?
[Oct 16-07 2:17:23]Amun <guild> i do not know that right now, those are all still in question
[Oct 16-07 2:17:33]Skunk <guild> then why put them back in until you know?
[Oct 16-07 2:17:59]Amun <guild> why not put them back in?
[Oct 16-07 2:18:5]Skunk <guild> seems like it would be smart to have your plan all thought out and laid out before you even started...
[Oct 16-07 2:18:11]Noxus <guild> bah i don't see the big deal the guild items should all be the same and just make them the same as normal ones... as for guild wax if they go in give everyone a chance to buy them...
[Oct 16-07 2:18:15]Skunk <guild> kinda feels like you are just making it up as you go along
[Oct 16-07 2:18:23]Skunk <guild> which does not inspire a lot of trust
[Oct 16-07 2:18:31]Nulvect <guild> man, wouldn't it be great if everything always went perfectly and everyone was happy about it??
[Oct 16-07 2:18:47]Noxus <guild> no
[Oct 16-07 2:18:55]Noxus <guild> then i'd have nothing to complain about :p
[Oct 16-07 2:18:59]Skunk <guild> just voicing my concerns nulvect, if you don't want those then that's fine
[Oct 16-07 2:19:23]Skunk <guild> i'll just shut up now and be the model guild leader, anything the imms say goes, please do your will
[Oct 16-07 2:19:43]Noxus <guild> hey don't get me wrong im very happy for the big first step for guilds :p
[Oct 16-07 2:20:5]Nulvect <guild> everyone whined so loudly when guild items were taken out that they were put back in...
[Oct 16-07 2:20:17]Nulvect <guild> and now you're whining that they were put back in
[Oct 16-07 2:20:17]Skunk <guild> did they?
[Oct 16-07 2:20:27]Skunk <guild> please show me where i whined that they were taken out
[Oct 16-07 2:20:29]Noxus <guild> yeah lol
[Oct 16-07 2:20:29]Amun <guild> the thing is skunk, things are done for a reason, the healers were not taken out compeletly, they were taken out to be balanced, you know the think you're saying you want?  Then they were put back in.  Right now they are not hurting anything, but the question is why keep it when they do the same thing as oils/ointments/stones?  And yet we have those in the guilds that cried when they were taken out for review.  That's why they're in and that's why they're review
[Oct 16-07 2:21:7]Amun <guild> it seems to me that what's happening on my end is a lot more thought out than what players want.
[Oct 16-07 2:21:26]Noxus <guild> well why put them in when they are the same i don't know just to have something fun and different. same reason you put in armour that is the same but with a different name i guess...
[Oct 16-07 2:21:45]Amun <guild> and it's more work to remove the old itmes right now and we had rather spend the time working on the new stuff
[Oct 16-07 2:21:52]Skunk <guild> as far as i was told, guild armour has no ac, so it's not the same as the other stuff
[Oct 16-07 2:22:12]Noxus <guild> yeah i was told armour had no ac but i already know thats a lie :\
[Oct 16-07 2:22:12]Amun <guild> i said healers
[Oct 16-07 2:22:18]Amun <guild> i didnt say anything about armour
[Oct 16-07 2:23:32]Stormbringer <guild> I asked Amun to remove the items, balance them, and put them back in. That is why it was done, according to my plan.
[Oct 16-07 2:24:2]Stormbringer <guild> you two getting your own guilds was step two.
[Oct 16-07 2:24:26]Stormbringer <guild> step three is coming, once it is done we will work on other guild items, etc
[Oct 16-07 2:24:34]<guild> Noxus is glad just likes to complain :p
[Oct 16-07 2:25:26]Stormbringer <guild> well stop, your stressing out the one person on this staff you should be thanking for even taking the time. I was happy to leave things as they were because I knew changes would create havoc on the staff.
[Oct 16-07 2:25:50]Skunk <guild> so stormy, are the guild healing items going to be staying in?
[Oct 16-07 2:26:2]Skunk <guild> as well as waxes, and armour, and weapons?
[Oct 16-07 2:26:36]Stormbringer <guild> probably so but I am not totally decided yet
[Oct 16-07 2:27:4]Stormbringer <guild> I like each guild having their own customized stuuf
[Oct 16-07 2:27:22]Noxus <guild> i do too
[Oct 16-07 2:27:50]Stormbringer <guild> but it can get to be a real pain sometimes, specially when other guilds decide they want more, etc it gets to be a never ending and thankless job for the one doing them
[Oct 16-07 2:28:0]Noxus <guild> just later whenever other things are done the other guilds that don't have as much should get a chance to buy upgrades and im sure it'll happen
[Oct 16-07 2:35:17]Skunk <guild> i know this idea has been tossed around a little before, but can we ever take trophys from corpses? like ears or something, and have a little necklace or something of ears, when you look at it, it could list whos ears you have
[Oct 16-07 2:35:37]Skunk <guild> only from other players corpses, not npcs
[Oct 16-07 2:41:29]Stormbringer <guild> hrm
[Oct 16-07 2:41:39]Stormbringer <guild> sorry was not ignoring, just thinking it over
[Oct 16-07 2:41:43]<guild> Skunk nods.
[Oct 16-07 2:41:55]Stormbringer <guild> I don't know Skunk
[Oct 16-07 2:42:7]Skunk <guild> i imagine it wouldn't be easy to code
[Oct 16-07 2:42:15]Stormbringer <guild> that shifts the mud to a more PVP type thing
[Oct 16-07 2:42:21]Nulvect <guild> incredibly simple, actually
[Oct 16-07 2:42:45]Skunk <guild> well you wouldn't have to have a trophy necklace, but it would add a new dimension to it
[Oct 16-07 2:42:59]Stormbringer <guild> but I have been toying with the idea of creating a way to choose not to be involved in PVP
[Oct 16-07 2:43:41]Stormbringer <guild> we will discuss it, it is an interesting deminsion to PVP
[Oct 16-07 2:44:1]Skunk <guild> could be if you have a necklace you kinda declare yourself for pvp
[Oct 16-07 2:44:3]Noxus <guild> well the ears wouldn't really have any value :\
[Oct 16-07 2:44:43]Skunk <guild> but another interesting thing would be to be able to vote someone into pvp, so if they are mouthing off a lot or causing a ruckus, then if enough players voted them into pvp they could become fair game :D
[Oct 16-07 2:44:49]Stormbringer <guild> nah, if we have a choosable PVP system, you will do it during player creation. It would be a choose once and stay that way forever type thing
[Oct 16-07 2:45:41]Stormbringer <guild> thats an interesting concept too but we would need a much larger player base for voting like that I think
[Oct 16-07 2:45:59]Skunk <guild> yea we would, i think areas would bring in more players
[Oct 16-07 2:46:9]Noxus <guild> i don't really think you should pick on creation... my idea would be everyone starts out none pk and then at level 20 you can choose to be pk and then when you choose no turning back
[Oct 16-07 2:46:33]Stormbringer <guild> in the works, well kinda. We are working on fixing some of the ahhh less quality areas first
[Oct 16-07 2:46:43]Skunk <guild> works for me
[Oct 16-07 2:47:3]Stormbringer <guild> Roston is on top of the list =P
[Oct 16-07 2:47:15]Noxus <guild> ehh if you start working on areas you might want to redo east of the gate it talks about the town called outland and it being lawless
[Oct 16-07 2:47:29]Noxus <guild> when ive never heard of such a place :\
[Oct 16-07 2:47:53]Stormbringer <guild> nod, east of tirun will get totally redon...more forests I am sure =P
[Oct 16-07 2:48:11]Skunk <guild> i'll get that to you in about 5 minutes, that work?
[Oct 16-07 2:49:15]Stormbringer <guild> get what in 5 min?
[Oct 16-07 2:49:29]Skunk <guild> miss, sorry
[Oct 16-07 2:49:49]Stormbringer <guild> heh, I thought you meant you will get a forest for east of tirun to me in 5 =P
[Oct 16-07 2:50:3]Noxus <guild> yeah i was really confused :p
[Oct 16-07 2:50:11]Stormbringer <guild> I was gonna get happy =P
[Oct 16-07 2:50:35]Amun <guild> i like happy
[Oct 16-07 2:51:25]Skunk <guild> sorry to tease you like that stormy, but i'm not nulvect, can't code like that ;)
[Oct 16-07 2:51:53]Stormbringer <guild> nul can do many great things but I doubt even he could have a decent forest in 5 min ;)
[Oct 16-07 2:51:59]Skunk <guild> you guys ever think about putting in a player cap again?
[Oct 16-07 2:52:9]Daos <guild> unless he did it with a virtual server :)
[Oct 16-07 2:52:19]Noxus <guild> player cap??
[Oct 16-07 2:52:25]Stormbringer <guild> even then, it would take a couple of hours D
[Oct 16-07 2:52:35]Daos <guild> oh, though you could have an area done that way in like 30 mins?
[Oct 16-07 2:52:37]Skunk <guild> limit the amount of players that can be in a guild
[Oct 16-07 2:52:45]Noxus <guild> ah
[Oct 16-07 3:5:31]Stormbringer <guild> we are talking about guild caps
[Oct 16-07 3:5:45]Stormbringer <guild> I am just not sure about it
[Oct 16-07 3:5:55]Skunk <guild> i would vote for them, start em low like maybe 5 or so and let them increase with the playerbase
[Oct 16-07 3:6:13]Stormbringer <guild> that would be the plan if we instated them
[Oct 16-07 3:6:29]Skunk <guild> have my vote ;)
[Oct 16-07 3:6:45]Stormbringer <guild> maybe taking it to a vote is the right thing to do
[Oct 16-07 3:34:45]Skunk <guild> and yea, still can't deposit into shop
[Oct 16-07 4:18:57]Skunk <guild> stormy can you make a quick change to spelling of an item?
[Oct 16-07 4:19:9]Stormbringer <guild> maybe =P
[Oct 16-07 4:32:56]Skunk <guild> have a sec to come to this room stormy?
[Oct 16-07 4:36:26]Stormbringer <guild> fixed
[Oct 16-07 4:36:32]Stormbringer <guild> I think
[Oct 16-07 4:36:37]Skunk <guild> cool thanks
[Oct 16-07 5:11:2]Skunk <guild> thanks again amun and stormy
[Oct 16-07 5:11:18]Skunk <guild> next on the list, lockers and a scry pool :P
[Oct 16-07 5:11:28]<guild> Skunk hopes you know that's a joke... ;)

[Oct 23-07 18:23:17]Noxus <guild> don't like how the balances are going... i think making all guilds the exact same is just a lameass way of doing things
[Oct 23-07 18:23:41]Skunk <guild> what do you propose in place of the way things are going now?
[Oct 23-07 18:24:11]Skunk <guild> and as far as the same i agree, but things should be equal for all guilds
[Oct 23-07 18:24:23]Noxus <guild> well i'd like it when i ask for a guild scry pool to get changed slightly not to be told no without even talking about it
[Oct 23-07 18:24:49]Skunk <guild> what did you want changed?
[Oct 23-07 18:25:3]Skunk <guild> and shoot, i was told i couldn't even have one yet...
[Oct 23-07 18:25:5]Noxus <guild> well the lowest rank can't use scry pools i asked for that to be changed

[Dec 19-07 22:25:56]<guild> Skunk nods.
[Dec 19-07 22:26:16]Skunk <guild> i think that is one of the reasons things have been slow around here
[Dec 19-07 22:26:32]Amun <guild> nods- i know my behind was busy as no other
[Dec 19-07 22:26:32]Skunk <guild> people want to see what is going to change before they put more work into a char

[Feb 22-08 22:14:45]Amun <guild> going fine thanks, sorry computer was frozen
[Feb 22-08 22:14:59]Amun <guild> my computer is sucking and a friend said clean it but i dont know how
[Feb 22-08 22:15:11]Yang <guild> ooooo
[Feb 22-08 22:15:33]Amun <guild> and i'm sick :(
[Feb 22-08 22:15:39]Yang <guild> type format C:>
[Feb 22-08 22:15:47]Yang <guild> oooo sorrty to hear
[Feb 22-08 22:15:51]Amun <guild> but i have a paper due on sunday so i'm trying to get it done but i want to sleep :(
[Feb 22-08 22:16:3]Yang <guild> no ... no sleep
[Feb 22-08 22:16:5]Nulvect <guild> you probably have the windows virus
[Feb 22-08 22:16:7]Yang <guild> sleep bad
[Feb 22-08 22:16:17]Yang <guild> you need Trend
[Feb 22-08 22:16:29]Yang <guild> bah everyone unidle and i have to go
[Feb 22-08 22:16:45]Amun <guild> what's that nul?
[Feb 22-08 22:17:19]Nulvect <guild> well, it takes over your computer and makes everything run more slowly than it should... comes in lots of variations too, most virus scanners don't pick it up...
[Feb 22-08 22:17:31]Amun <guild> how do i fix it?
[Feb 22-08 22:17:39]Nulvect <guild> first there was 95, then 98, then ME, then 2000, then XP, then vista...
[Feb 22-08 22:17:59]Nulvect <guild> the ones before 95 were much less destructive though
[Feb 22-08 22:18:43]Nulvect <guild> the easiest way to fix it is to download ubuntu and install it, it will fix everything
[Feb 22-08 22:20:49]Amun <guild> long time for it to download
[Feb 22-08 22:20:55]Amun <guild> about 3 hours
[Feb 22-08 22:21:3]Amun <guild> i'm sorry 5
[Mar 2-08 3:5:49]Yang <guild> I give up my position as leader for forsaken, I turn over ownership to Noxus
[Mar 2-08 3:5:59]Amun <guild> not happening
[Mar 2-08 3:6:57]Yang <guild> i think he is a better person than I in reguards to leadership
[Apr 30-08 22:38:0]Yang <guild> Hiya Amun how are things
[Apr 30-08 22:38:36]Amun <guild> fine, working on a paper due tomorrow..it's my birthday!
[May 6-08 17:34:26]Ironman <guild> sup damien
[May 6-08 17:38:14]Damien <guild> sup scrap
[May 6-08 22:24:53]Damien <guild> how are things coming along with the new guild system amun?
[May 6-08 22:25:22]Amun <guild> they're good, just have room descriptions and some final touches on certain things, and some permission needed on some stuff
[May 6-08 22:25:34]<guild> Damien nods.
[May 6-08 22:25:38]Damien <guild> would be nice to see some stuff in
[May 6-08 22:26:18]Amun <guild> not had much time the past few with school coming to a close, ut all the descriptions are written, i just have to decide how i'm going to place them together
[May 6-08 22:26:32]Amun <guild> not only for the guild stuff but also for the sky temple
[May 6-08 22:26:38]Damien <guild> pygmies?
[May 6-08 22:27:4]Amun <guild> that part isn't done yet, the town is all done except the descriptions and one string of code that's proving to be a pain in my rear end
[May 6-08 22:27:22]Amun <guild> there is XP areas in the town though, as well as elite vital healers
[May 13-08 15:44:58]<guild> Yang wants to purchase a teleporter for Forsaken

[May 20-08 17:17:54]<guild> Yang nods
[May 21-08 14:16:1]Piehl <guild> list
[May 22-08 19:55:38]Zack <guild> are the viewing pools, etc not working in guild halls?
[May 22-08 19:56:22]Amun <guild> they should be workin..welcome back
[May 22-08 19:56:57]Zack <guild> everytime i try to use it on anyone at all it says no name was found
[May 22-08 19:59:1]Skunk <guild> so that means that i can buy a pool for my guild now?
[May 22-08 19:59:20]Amun <guild> it's workin fine...
[May 22-08 20:0:0]Skunk <guild> and then?
[May 22-08 20:0:13]Amun <guild> that was to zack
[May 22-08 20:0:26]Skunk <guild> no response for my question?
[May 22-08 20:0:35]Amun <guild> did not see you had one
[May 22-08 20:0:38]Amun <guild> im sorry
[May 22-08 20:1:14]Amun <guild> what was the question skunk?
[May 22-08 20:1:28]Skunk <guild> last guild should work... but anyway
[May 22-08 20:1:38]Skunk <guild> so that means that i can buy a pool for my guild now?
[May 22-08 20:1:42]Amun <guild> i'm doing other things as well, easiest for you to just tell me
[May 22-08 20:2:10]Amun <guild> you were allowed to before...
[May 22-08 20:2:14]Zack <guild> addons can be purchased currently?
[May 22-08 20:2:20]Amun <guild> not really zack
[May 22-08 20:2:20]Zack <guild> i think thats his question
[May 22-08 20:2:28]Amun <guild> but since most guilds have pools
[May 22-08 20:2:36]Amun <guild> it's only fair to allow his guild it as well
[May 22-08 20:2:46]Skunk <guild> ok, i would like to purchase a pool then, cost?
[May 22-08 20:2:54]Amun <guild> actually
[May 22-08 20:3:0]Amun <guild> you do need to hold off on it though
[May 22-08 20:3:14]Amun <guild> until stormy comes on, b/c i dont want you to have it for 2 days then it's out
[May 22-08 20:3:32]Amun <guild> so, if i dont get a chance to talk to him by sunday
[May 22-08 20:3:37]Amun <guild> you can have one
[May 22-08 20:3:39]Amun <guild> deal?
[May 22-08 20:3:41]Skunk <guild> k, that works
[May 22-08 20:3:45]Amun <guild> kk thanks
[May 22-08 20:4:5]Amun <guild> make sure to remind me on sunday as well, chances are i wont need it
[May 22-08 20:4:9]Amun <guild> but just incase
[May 25-08 14:10:38]Yang <guild> the members of Forsaken have spoken and I will not deny them their right to choose, I will never deny them again
[May 28-08 1:52:11]Piehl <guild> nully
[May 28-08 1:52:19]Piehl <guild> i can't clear my own board.
[May 28-08 1:52:29]Nulvect <guild> come get sung to and I'll fix it
[May 28-08 1:52:51]Piehl <guild> alright.
[Jun 10-08 18:34:27]Skunk <guild> hey amun
[Jun 10-08 18:40:43]Skunk <guild> hey amun
[Jun 10-08 18:40:49]Amun <guild> hi skunk
[Jun 10-08 18:40:57]Skunk <guild> this is your reminder about a scrying pool for unholy ;)
[Jun 10-08 18:41:1]Skunk <guild> i think it's been 2 days
[Jun 10-08 18:41:19]Amun <guild> nods- i remember and yeah, needless-to-say it has been
[Jun 10-08 18:41:25]Skunk <guild> cool
[Jun 10-08 18:43:17]Amun <guild> where do you want it?
[Jun 10-08 18:43:21]Skunk <guild> lemme check
[Jun 10-08 18:43:45]Skunk <guild> can you do it off this room?
[Jun 10-08 18:43:49]Amun <guild> hold on
[Jun 10-08 18:44:3]Skunk <guild> or even in this room would be cool
[Jun 10-08 18:48:1]Amun <guild> ok
[Jul 23-08 16:36:4]Amun <guild> why are you all idle?
[Jul 23-08 16:36:6]Amun <guild> jeesh
[Jul 23-08 16:46:22]Amun <guild> when ya'll come back...there is a post on the guild leader board
[Jul 23-08 17:17:40]Yang <guild> are we limited to 1 locker per guild?
[Jul 23-08 17:17:55]Nulvect <guild> most definitely yes
[Jul 23-08 17:18:9]Yang <guild> ok
[Jul 23-08 17:19:11]Yang <guild> how about guild waxes and seals? would that be out of the question?
[Jul 23-08 17:20:9]Nulvect <guild> well, it's been done before
[Jul 23-08 17:24:23]Piehl <guild> nul
[Jul 23-08 17:24:37]Piehl <guild> if you want to change your info and stuff, do you have to pay for the items changing as well?
[Jul 23-08 17:24:45]Nulvect <guild> -everything-
[Jul 23-08 17:24:53]Piehl <guild> what?
[Jul 23-08 17:25:13]Piehl <guild> why? it's already there it just changes names
[Jul 23-08 17:25:29]Nulvect <guild> it has to be changed in many places
[Jul 23-08 17:25:43]Piehl <guild> how so
[Jul 23-08 17:26:13]Nulvect <guild> well, every room or item in your hall that uses the name of the guild will probably have to be changed by hand
[Jul 23-08 17:26:29]Piehl <guild> what if you do it yourself?
[Jul 23-08 17:26:49]Nulvect <guild> it is not something you can do yourself
[Jul 23-08 17:27:5]Piehl <guild> ....
[Jul 23-08 17:27:31]Nulvect <guild> filenames, directories, and several places where guild info is handled will all have to change
[Jul 23-08 17:27:45]Piehl <guild> blah, theres no use then.
[Jul 23-08 17:27:57]Piehl <guild> it'd be cheaper to just remove last saints and start a new one
[Jul 23-08 17:28:27]Nulvect <guild> yep
[Jul 23-08 17:28:44]Piehl <guild> lame
[Jul 23-08 17:28:55]Piehl <guild> oh well, i'll figure something out then
[Jul 23-08 17:29:11]Nulvect <guild> it's a 2 hour job at least :P
[Jul 23-08 17:29:33]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Jul 23-08 17:29:41]Piehl <guild> oh yeah nul
[Jul 23-08 17:29:51]Piehl <guild> these rooms by my guild hall are bugged cmere and look
[Jul 23-08 17:30:7]Piehl <guild> everytime you type fly it brings you to a place that says coord=NULL
[Jul 23-08 17:30:23]Nulvect <guild> yes, and I don't know why
[Jul 23-08 17:30:31]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Jul 23-08 17:31:23]Piehl <guild> anything i can do besides quit out? :p
[Jul 23-08 17:31:33]Nulvect <guild> land
[Jul 23-08 17:31:43]Piehl <guild> woo ;0
[Jul 23-08 17:32:7]Piehl <guild> well i might just get ls removed then nul, and start a new one
[Jul 23-08 17:32:27]Nulvect <guild> k, that's amun's department
[Jul 23-08 17:32:37]Piehl <guild> oh yeah
[Jul 23-08 17:32:39]Piehl <guild> :)
[Jul 23-08 17:35:31]Yang <guild> i wanna join :P
[Jul 23-08 17:35:37]Yang <guild> jk
[Jul 23-08 17:49:47]Piehl <guild> ok!
[Jul 23-08 17:49:51]<guild> Piehl adds yang.
[Jul 23-08 17:50:3]Yang <guild> lol 5 bucks says i dont meet requirements
[Jul 23-08 17:50:17]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Jul 23-08 17:50:25]Piehl <guild> for what :P
[Jul 23-08 17:50:33]<guild> Yang is weak
[Jul 23-08 17:50:41]Piehl <guild> naw
[Jul 23-08 17:50:45]<guild> Piehl IS weak.
[Jul 23-08 17:50:51]Yang <guild> bah
[Jul 23-08 17:50:55]Yang <guild> lies, all lies
[Jul 23-08 17:51:11]Piehl <guild> naw :P

[Jul 23-08 17:53:20]Yang <guild> you know!
[Jul 23-08 17:58:12]Damien <guild> who determines a guild items power/strength?
[Jul 23-08 17:59:4]Damien <guild> also, will portals between halls come back?
[Jul 23-08 18:25:55]Skunk <guild> what do you want to rename your guild to pie?
[Jul 23-08 18:26:3]Nulvect <guild> the pie eaters
[Jul 23-08 18:26:5]Piehl <guild> can't now ;0
[Jul 23-08 18:26:7]Skunk <guild> haha
[Jul 23-08 18:26:19]Skunk <guild> ok, so what do you want your new guild to be called? :P
[Jul 23-08 18:26:23]Piehl <guild> i was hoping it wouldn't cost but about 3mil to do it
[Jul 23-08 18:26:37]Piehl <guild> but with all the crap in ls it'd cost like 200mil
[Jul 23-08 18:26:51]Piehl <guild> idk i may just quit guilds entirely
[Jul 23-08 18:26:53]Skunk <guild> so cheaper to have em rename?
[Jul 23-08 18:27:7]Piehl <guild> naw cheaper to make a new one
[Jul 23-08 18:27:35]<guild> Piehl isn't paying to rename a guild.
[Jul 23-08 18:28:13]Piehl <guild> you never knwi may just keep ls
[Jul 23-08 23:32:21]Skunk <guild> new post

[Jul 24-08 1:24:8]Skunk <guild> well when you can, please read and respond to my post
[Jul 24-08 1:24:14]Amun <guild> will do
[Jul 24-08 1:25:0]Amun <guild> i wont tell you what i'm doing
[Jul 24-08 1:25:4]Amun <guild> if that's what it's about
[Jul 24-08 1:25:34]Skunk <guild> so you feel that we don't need to know about the changes you are making to the guild system to be able to make a good decision about what to change in our guild?
[Jul 24-08 1:26:12]Piehl <guild> skunk can she please fix this prob first
[Jul 24-08 1:26:18]Amun <guild> i replied to your post on your alt about what to would be good to stay away from
[Jul 24-08 1:26:54]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Jul 24-08 1:27:13]Skunk <guild> don't buy a scry pool?
[Jul 24-08 1:27:21]Amun <guild> then read the next post
[Jul 24-08 1:27:23]Piehl <guild> no portals
[Jul 24-08 1:27:45]Piehl <guild> healing shops don't come wif food/drink
[Jul 24-08 1:28:31]Skunk <guild> can you tell us if you are going to start the guild changes before you implement the new system?
[Jul 24-08 1:28:51]Amun <guild> yes, we are starting guild changes before
[Jul 24-08 1:28:57]Skunk <guild> why?
[Jul 24-08 1:29:13]Amun <guild> b/c
[Jul 24-08 1:29:27]Skunk <guild> i'm sorry, was that an answer?
[Jul 24-08 1:29:35]Amun <guild> it's the only answer you're getting, so yes
[Jul 24-08 1:29:41]Skunk <guild> wow, could have fooled me
[Jul 24-08 1:29:49]Rohl <guild> come on kids play nice
[Jul 24-08 1:30:27]Amun <guild> seriously skunk, take the stick out, be happy that you get to change and update stuff b/c i don't even HAVE to do that while I'm trying to get other stuff done
[Jul 24-08 1:30:57]Skunk <guild> am i the only on here that feels that the information on the new guild system would be beneficial to know what the new guild system is going to be like BEFORE making changes to my guild?
[Jul 24-08 1:30:57]Amun <guild> now if you excuse me, I'm trying to fix a treasury
[Jul 24-08 1:31:15]Amun <guild> 1 - you are NOT getting info on it, so get over it
[Jul 24-08 1:31:17]Skunk <guild> that is not for you to answer amun
[Jul 24-08 1:31:31]Skunk <guild> that question is for other members, fix the treasury by all means
[Jul 24-08 1:31:33]Amun <guild> 2 - I told you what to stay away from
[Jul 24-08 1:31:45]Amun <guild> see it does matter what I say, as I'm the guild immortal
[Jul 24-08 1:31:47]Skunk <guild> you told us not to buy scry pools
[Jul 24-08 1:31:49]Amun <guild> and the one making it
[Jul 24-08 1:31:51]Skunk <guild> that's it
[Jul 24-08 1:32:5]Amun <guild> then everything else you'll be ok on...OBVIOUSLY
[Jul 24-08 1:33:49]Skunk <guild> would it be possible to get the equivalent of <updatenews> for guilds?
[Jul 24-08 1:34:25]Amun <guild> as things are put in of course, but as they're not yet it wouldnt help too much right now.. But yeah, I'll add things in there as they go in
[Jul 24-08 1:34:33]Amun <guild> only for all guilds though
[Jul 24-08 1:34:43]Amun <guild> i wont add in what i did for each individual guild
[Jul 24-08 1:35:27]Skunk <guild> would it be possible to delay the individual guild changes until after you have the new guild system in, so you have more free time to work on it, and it doesn't get delayed any longer?
[Jul 24-08 1:35:31]Amun <guild> no
[Jul 24-08 1:35:47]Amun <guild> I have the free time now
[Jul 24-08 1:35:49]Skunk <guild> well i just figured since you have so much on your plate already, why over fill it...
[Jul 24-08 1:35:57]Amun <guild> no right now i don't
[Jul 24-08 1:36:11]Skunk <guild> so why not focus on the guild system and finish it?
[Jul 24-08 1:36:23]Amun <guild> skunk, it's already done
[Jul 24-08 1:36:31]Skunk <guild> so what are we waiting for?
[Jul 24-08 1:36:37]Amun <guild> daos to review it
[Jul 24-08 1:36:57]Amun <guild> it's been done for 6 months now
[Jul 24-08 1:37:3]Piehl <guild> ;)
[Jul 24-08 1:37:13]Skunk <guild> stormy told me you still had changes to make
[Jul 24-08 1:37:17]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Jul 24-08 1:37:19]Skunk <guild> that was about a week ago
[Jul 24-08 1:37:21]Piehl <guild> stormys been on lately?
[Jul 24-08 1:37:35]Amun <guild> yeah i need to make changes i'm sure, but as it's not been reviewed
[Jul 24-08 1:37:35]Skunk <guild> stormy was logged in today
[Jul 24-08 1:37:41]Amun <guild> i have no idea what those changes are
[Jul 24-08 1:37:51]Piehl <guild> boo i was working out probably
[Jul 24-08 1:38:1]Skunk <guild> could it possibly be reviewed by another imm that has the time?
[Jul 24-08 1:38:11]Piehl <guild> lol none of them do :P
[Jul 24-08 1:38:13]Skunk <guild> since daos hasn't been able to do it in 6 months
[Jul 24-08 1:38:17]Amun <guild> nul is reviewing a couple areas
[Jul 24-08 1:38:41]Amun <guild> and doing his other work
[Jul 24-08 1:38:45]Piehl <guild> yawn
[Jul 24-08 1:38:57]Amun <guild> pyro has a lot on his plate etc etc...it's Daos's job as well
[Jul 24-08 1:39:23]Amun <guild> point is Skunk, things will get done and in when they do
[Jul 24-08 1:39:44]Amun <guild> and i've told you before I'll let you know when they are
[Jul 24-08 1:39:51]Piehl <guild> skunk run with me tomorrow
[Jul 24-08 1:39:57]Piehl <guild> at 5 am
[Jul 24-08 1:39:57]Amun <guild> stormy doesn't want you people to know what's going on
[Jul 24-08 1:40:15]Amun <guild> and i have to have things reviewed, which all takes time
[Jul 24-08 1:40:33]Piehl <guild> yawn
[Jul 24-08 1:40:57]Amun <guild> and if you think i'll have any time this fall to do all the changes, you're nuts...as I am pretty much not home from mon-sat
[Jul 24-08 1:41:11]Amun <guild> plus, if you want anyone to listen to you, you have to listen to them
[Jul 24-08 1:44:46]Skunk <guild> is the help guild addons up to date?
[Jul 24-08 1:44:56]Amun <guild> yes, i changed it all this afternoon
[Jul 24-08 1:45:16]Skunk <guild> so we can or can't have additional class halls? post says no, help says yes
[Jul 24-08 1:45:46]Skunk <guild> or is that class hall, not guild hall?
[Jul 24-08 1:46:18]Skunk <guild> and also, will we be able to move our guild hall entrance?
[Jul 24-08 1:46:48]Amun <guild> no extra guild halls, you can have class halls
[Jul 24-08 1:47:0]Skunk <guild> k was a little confused on that, thanks
[Jul 24-08 1:47:4]Amun <guild> and you can move your entrance, but it has to remain in tirun
[Jul 24-08 1:47:18]Skunk <guild> cost on that?
[Jul 24-08 1:47:20]<guild> Piehl moves his to tirun []
[Jul 24-08 1:47:26]Skunk <guild> haha lazy pie :P
[Jul 24-08 1:47:42]Piehl <guild> :P
[Jul 24-08 1:47:48]Amun <guild> for changing the entrance? shoot, that's easy work...you can have that for free
[Jul 24-08 1:47:52]Skunk <guild> cool
[Jul 24-08 1:48:0]Piehl <guild> can i move mine to tirun []
[Jul 24-08 1:48:30]Skunk <guild> will we ever be able to have elite items?
[Jul 24-08 1:48:36]Amun <guild> no
[Jul 24-08 1:48:46]Piehl <guild> yay
[Jul 24-08 1:48:52]Piehl <guild> elite = useless anyways
[Jul 24-08 1:49:0]Skunk <guild> can we pay for ac or wc up to a point?
[Jul 24-08 1:49:8]Skunk <guild> kinda like raising levels on guild guard
[Jul 24-08 1:49:38]Skunk <guild> speaking of guild guards, other people can't enter the room they are in, is there a point to em, other then looking cool?
[Jul 24-08 1:49:48]Amun <guild> hold on skunk, i'm tryin to fix the treasury
[Jul 24-08 1:49:52]Skunk <guild> k
[Jul 24-08 1:50:26]Skunk <guild> i want a pie plushy that backstabs for me ;)
[Jul 24-08 1:50:34]<guild> Piehl refuses pie plushies
[Jul 24-08 1:51:2]Skunk <guild> i would probably get charged the 5mil for that :P
[Jul 24-08 1:51:24]Piehl <guild> :)
[Jul 24-08 1:59:39]Escobar <guild> wow, posts on the guild board, hooray. :)
[Jul 24-08 2:0:41]Amun <guild> ok skunk
[Jul 24-08 2:0:43]Amun <guild> what's up?
[Jul 24-08 2:1:17]Amun <guild> i need to get to bed though, so we have to move quick like
[Jul 24-08 2:1:39]Escobar <guild> hey, can we do add'l lockers if we already have one?
[Jul 24-08 2:1:51]Amun <guild> no, 1 locker per guild
[Jul 24-08 2:1:55]Amun <guild> actually guys
[Jul 24-08 2:2:1]Amun <guild> if you have questions post them please
[Jul 24-08 2:2:3]Escobar <guild> time delayed ointments?
[Jul 24-08 2:2:11]Amun <guild> that way we don't get 1000 of the same question
[Jul 24-08 2:2:23]Amun <guild> ointments would work like they do now
[Jul 24-08 2:2:37]Escobar <guild> but it would be called ointment. It'd be...soul butter!
[Jul 24-08 2:2:43]Escobar <guild> totally different
[Jul 24-08 2:2:49]Escobar <guild> and great with jam
[Jul 24-08 2:2:55]Amun <guild> it could be called whatever you want lol
[Jul 24-08 2:3:15]Piehl <guild> can i name mine
[Jul 24-08 2:3:19]Escobar <guild> since it wouldnt be"ointment" it could be delayed, yes?
[Jul 24-08 2:3:41]Amun <guild> it would be coded like an ointment...just have a different name
[Jul 24-08 2:3:43]Escobar <guild> Piehl makes PiehlJuice
[Jul 24-08 2:4:9]<guild> Escobar acks
[Jul 24-08 2:4:31]Escobar <guild> oh, so when is my week coming up, Amun?

[Jul 25-08 22:37:38]Yang <guild> since we are leaders and all, we could be able to check  guild  post and leader posts no matter where we are or get a message telling us if there is a new one

[Aug 5-08 22:19:28]Amun <guild> and what would this flame special do?
[Aug 5-08 22:19:32]Skunk <guild> fire damage
[Aug 5-08 22:20:20]Amun <guild> elemental damages are not in the game if you want it to work that way, otherwise it's just a special that has fire as it's content, if I'm wrong then please explain more so i can understand what you mean
[Aug 5-08 22:21:12]Skunk <guild> so basically we can have the special say whatever we want as long it just adds damage or healing?
[Aug 5-08 22:21:44]Amun <guild> yes, it just can't do both
[Aug 5-08 22:21:54]Skunk <guild> how about lower or raise alignment?
[Aug 5-08 22:22:14]Amun <guild> no, it will only be able to heal or do extra damage
[Aug 5-08 22:22:46]Skunk <guild> so that's all we have for options on specials, heal or damage?
[Aug 5-08 22:23:2]Amun <guild> yes, just like it's specified in help guild addons
[Aug 5-08 22:23:14]Yang <guild> can our guards be cloaked Amun?
[Aug 5-08 22:23:16]Skunk <guild> well i thought we might be allowed to get creative
[Aug 5-08 22:23:24]Skunk <guild> yang there is no point to guild guards
[Aug 5-08 22:23:36]Amun <guild> yes they can yang
[Aug 5-08 22:23:40]Yang <guild> i gots some gold to splurge
[Aug 5-08 22:23:56]Amun <guild> seriously skunk you're close to ruining it all for everyone with your crappy attitude
[Aug 5-08 22:24:30]Skunk <guild> well i'm sorry amun, i just feel there are not many options for guilds right now
[Aug 5-08 22:24:42]Amun <guild> be happy you have options at all
[Aug 5-08 22:24:44]Skunk <guild> and i also feel that my suggestions or ideas are just being downed withough thought
[Aug 5-08 22:24:46]Amun <guild> b/c for a long time guilds didnt
[Aug 5-08 22:25:4]Amun <guild> you think anything you've brought up has not already been discussed?
[Aug 5-08 22:25:6]Skunk <guild> i am aware of that amun
[Aug 5-08 22:25:24]Amun <guild> it has all been talked about, and if it hasn't i tell you i'll talk with someone about it
[Aug 5-08 22:25:44]Amun <guild> I may be the guild immortal yes, but Nul has the final say and I work with him on ideas
[Aug 5-08 22:25:56]Skunk <guild> so alignment raise or lower as a special on a weapon or armour has been discussed?
[Aug 5-08 22:25:58]Amun <guild> so I won't give you a straight up answer unless I've talked with him
[Aug 5-08 22:26:20]Amun <guild> we don't want to make guilds so much more advanced than that of not being in one, b/c some people don't like to be in guilds
[Aug 5-08 22:26:36]Skunk <guild> yes i understand that
[Aug 5-08 22:26:42]Amun <guild> not to mention, if it does something with alignment, it favors more players than others
[Aug 5-08 22:26:46]Skunk <guild> but if you hamper them too much no one will want to join one
[Aug 5-08 22:26:58]Amun <guild> if it heals or does extra damage it favors everyone
[Aug 5-08 22:27:10]Skunk <guild> how would alignment only favor some players?
[Aug 5-08 22:27:28]Amun <guild> b/c in all honesty the only ones that alignment really matters to are demons and angels
[Aug 5-08 22:27:36]Skunk <guild> not true
[Aug 5-08 22:27:44]Amun <guild> pretty much true
[Aug 5-08 22:28:0]Skunk <guild> as a bastet i could raise or lower my alignment to take less or more damage from either an angel or demon
[Aug 5-08 22:28:12]Skunk <guild> if i'm really holy then levin won't hit me
[Aug 5-08 22:28:26]Nulvect <guild> alignment changing weapons would be quite rare in general and should not be something you can get all the time
[Aug 5-08 22:28:38]Skunk <guild> thank you nul, that i understand
[Aug 5-08 22:28:50]Amun <guild> and you can fight with me on the alignment thing if you want, but your answer is no.  And I don't own a guild, I work on them, you have many options on ways to expand your guild...therefore if your guild has no members it's your fault for nothing building it up not mine
[Aug 5-08 22:29:26]Skunk <guild> the reason i was discussing it with you amun is because your answers did not make sense to me
[Aug 5-08 22:29:36]Amun <guild> my answers were straight forward
[Aug 5-08 22:29:36]Skunk <guild> nuls answer makes sense
[Aug 5-08 22:29:46]Amun <guild> and how does mine not make sense?
[Aug 5-08 22:29:56]Amun <guild> it was to the point and simple for you
[Aug 5-08 22:30:8]Skunk <guild> you said it would only be beneficial for an angel or demon, that is not true in my opinion
[Aug 5-08 22:30:24]Amun <guild> what i said is it would be more beneficial
[Aug 5-08 22:30:34]Amun <guild> and that is true
[Aug 5-08 22:30:48]Skunk <guild> and i disagreed for reasons above, but nuls answer i understand, so i'm not discussing it anymore
[Aug 5-08 22:30:56]Amun <guild> that doesnt mean only, it means more
[Aug 5-08 22:31:16]Amun <guild> oh good, we done then?
[Aug 5-08 22:31:34]Skunk <guild> another question, unless i can't see it, is there a price for the special weapons/armour?
[Aug 5-08 22:32:4]Skunk <guild> i see the 100k for guild gear, but i assume the specials will cost more?
[Aug 5-08 22:32:30]Amun <guild> hold on
[Aug 5-08 22:32:50]Skunk <guild> also, how is the strength of guild gear set? can we pay more for more ac/wc?
[Aug 5-08 22:33:30]Amun <guild> no you can't.  you tell me where you're wanting it to be and if it's too much i'll bring it down and 100k for specials
[Aug 5-08 22:33:40]Amun <guild> which that i'll post so everyone will know
[Aug 5-08 22:34:30]Amun <guild> and if i write the descriptions for the specials it will cost 50k
[Aug 5-08 22:36:35]Skunk <guild> so we say what level we would like the item to autoload at?
[Aug 5-08 22:36:45]Skunk <guild> or should be put a wc/ac number out there?
[Aug 5-08 22:37:3]Amun <guild> either or, and if i agree i'll do it, if i don't i'll tell you
[Aug 5-08 22:37:19]Skunk <guild> ok, i know you said nothing close to elite
[Aug 5-08 22:37:27]Amun <guild> correct
[Aug 5-08 22:37:29]Skunk <guild> is that L45? L40? L35?
[Aug 5-08 22:37:33]Skunk <guild> where is the cutoff?
[Aug 5-08 22:37:43]Amun <guild> level 36 and below
[Aug 5-08 22:37:59]Skunk <guild> ok, so basically blackdagger or wolfclawish
[Aug 5-08 22:38:13]Amun <guild> roughly, not exactly though
[Aug 5-08 22:38:43]Skunk <guild> ok, and will guild items only AL for that guild?
[Aug 5-08 22:39:9]Amun <guild> yes, but if it has specials it could be off that guild and level
[Aug 5-08 22:39:31]Skunk <guild> i'm not sure what you mean on the specials
[Aug 5-08 22:39:51]Amun <guild> if your item has a special on it
[Aug 5-08 22:40:15]Skunk <guild> then?
[Aug 5-08 22:40:21]Amun <guild> if it's a very good special...sorry about that phone
[Aug 5-08 22:40:41]Amun <guild> if it's a very good special the WC/AC will be lower than what it normally would be in the game
[Aug 5-08 22:40:53]Skunk <guild> understood, but what did you mean about off?
[Aug 5-08 22:41:1]Amun <guild> and it would only al after a certain lvl, b/c you shouldn't get a special at lvl 1
[Aug 5-08 22:41:17]Skunk <guild> agreed
[Aug 5-08 22:41:23]Piehl <guild> hmm
[Aug 5-08 22:41:35]Skunk <guild> so we could in theory have an item with a very good special that al's at L36
[Aug 5-08 22:41:35]Piehl <guild> you buggin amun again kil :P
[Aug 5-08 22:41:47]Piehl <guild> *skunk
[Aug 5-08 22:41:47]Amun <guild> off that guild meant would AL for the guild but have a certain lvl as well, sorry bad wording
[Aug 5-08 22:42:1]Skunk <guild> i'm trying to very nice to amun and not harass her
[Aug 5-08 22:42:12]Amun <guild> not working so much ;)
[Aug 5-08 22:42:18]Skunk <guild> hey i'm trying...
[Aug 5-08 22:42:26]Amun <guild> you're not harassing but you're not being nice at all
[Aug 5-08 22:42:34]Skunk <guild> all i'm doing is asking questions
[Aug 5-08 22:42:52]Amun <guild> but you're speaking rudely and accusing me of crap
[Aug 5-08 22:43:14]Amun <guild> asking questions is not innocent, i do it to annoy people too
[Aug 5-08 22:43:32]Skunk <guild> i'm not trying to annoy you, i feel that my questions are very legitimate
[Aug 5-08 22:43:32]Piehl <guild> lets bug amun
[Aug 5-08 22:43:40]Nulvect <guild> let's not
[Aug 5-08 22:43:48]Piehl <guild> lets bug nully!
[Aug 5-08 22:43:48]Amun <guild> most of them are answered in help guild addons
[Aug 5-08 22:43:56]<guild> Piehl tackles nully.
[Aug 5-08 22:44:8]<guild> Nulvect turns into a puddle of goop.
[Aug 5-08 22:44:8]Skunk <guild> i'm sorry amun but guild addons is not very clear
[Aug 5-08 22:44:22]Amun <guild> you're the ONLY one having problems understanding it
[Aug 5-08 22:44:30]Amun <guild> so apparently they're pretty clear
[Aug 5-08 22:44:38]Piehl <guild> oh amun question
[Aug 5-08 22:44:42]Amun <guild> no pie
[Aug 5-08 22:44:44]Amun <guild> :)
[Aug 5-08 22:44:58]Piehl <guild> if i do the descs for the new guildhall myslef, do i email them to you or somethin?
[Aug 5-08 22:45:12]Amun <guild> do you not read boards still? lol ;)
[Aug 5-08 22:45:18]Piehl <guild> i never have
[Aug 5-08 22:45:20]Piehl <guild> :)
[Aug 5-08 22:45:24]Amun <guild> please start
[Aug 5-08 22:45:28]Piehl <guild> whyyy
[Aug 5-08 22:45:32]Piehl <guild> so mean to me
[Aug 5-08 22:45:52]Amun <guild> i just don't like having to say the same things over and over again Pie, sorry
[Aug 5-08 22:45:58]Amun <guild> but to answer your question
[Aug 5-08 22:46:8]Amun <guild> yes, you'd mudmail them to me when it's time for your guild
[Aug 5-08 22:46:8]Skunk <guild> do we need to do descriptions for class halls/lockers or do those use the stock ones?
[Aug 5-08 22:46:22]Piehl <guild> roger that thanks amun your a love *hugs*
[Aug 5-08 22:46:24]Amun <guild> if you want the ones from tirun you can have them
[Aug 5-08 22:46:36]Amun <guild> if you want originals, then you make them or i do for money
[Aug 5-08 22:46:46]Skunk <guild> ok, thank you
[Aug 5-08 22:46:56]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Aug 5-08 22:47:4]Piehl <guild> shesh skunk even i had that figured out *slap*
[Aug 5-08 22:48:2]Skunk <guild> one last question and then i'm done, this might be for nul as well
[Aug 5-08 22:48:16]Amun <guild> ok
[Aug 5-08 22:48:32]Skunk <guild> if we really wanted an alignment lower/raise item, could we pay the 5 mil and then have it be a rare pop in the store and cost like 1mil to buy?
[Aug 5-08 22:49:8]Amun <guild> can you give me a good reason why your guild would need such an item?
[Aug 5-08 22:49:40]Skunk <guild> we follow asmodeus, he is rather demonic, i know my guild mates would like an item that would help us to keep our alignment more in line with asmodeus.
[Aug 5-08 22:50:16]Amun <guild> you can do that by killing good mobs
[Aug 5-08 22:50:44]Amun <guild> I am sorry, but alignment specials is a no
[Aug 5-08 22:51:8]Amun <guild> I see what you're saying
[Aug 5-08 22:51:28]Amun <guild> but it doesn't seem fair to have that type of power for just a guild
[Aug 5-08 22:52:2]Skunk <guild> as you pointed out, it really wouldn't be that powerful, as you can accomplish the same thing by killing mobs, but i accept your answer
[Aug 5-08 22:52:24]Amun <guild> no, it would be powerful, and it wouldnt be the same as killing good mobs
[Aug 5-08 22:52:44]Amun <guild> in order for demons to use some of there stuff, they have to have lower alignments
[Aug 5-08 22:52:58]Amun <guild> if they have a guild weapon that can help them with that, then it wouldn't matter what mob they fought
[Aug 5-08 22:53:32]Amun <guild> i'm just using demons as an example
[Aug 5-08 22:53:44]Piehl <guild> demons suck
[Aug 5-08 22:53:50]Skunk <guild> yea you do :P
[Aug 5-08 22:53:52]Piehl <guild> bad example :P
[Aug 5-08 22:54:56]Skunk <guild> could you give me an example of an item that would cost 5mil/
[Aug 5-08 22:54:58]Skunk <guild> ?
[Aug 5-08 22:57:33]Skunk <guild> would it be possible to make my guild invadeable for 5mil?
[Aug 5-08 22:58:53]Piehl <guild> hey amun what guild are we on
[Aug 5-08 22:59:7]Skunk <guild> we aren't
[Aug 5-08 22:59:15]Piehl <guild> i may not get all the things i want done this week, so i may do it next week that good? give you a week to rest up
[Aug 5-08 22:59:15]Skunk <guild> read the board, postponed
[Aug 5-08 22:59:23]Yang <guild> make Skunks guild invadeable, i want all his gold and his toilet seat
[Aug 5-08 22:59:23]Piehl <guild> boo

[Aug 5-08 23:0:19]Piehl <guild> :)
[Aug 5-08 23:18:5]Amun <guild> just so you all know
[Aug 5-08 23:18:29]Amun <guild> guild ctf is already been brought up, I told stormy about it before I was even an imm
[Aug 5-08 23:18:43]Piehl <guild> guild ctf wouldn't be fair
[Aug 5-08 23:18:55]Amun <guild> and after certain things are done it will be looked at again
[Aug 5-08 23:18:59]Piehl <guild> just give me a team myself :P
[Aug 6-08 20:47:57]Pyro <guild> list
[Aug 6-08 21:2:21]Nulvect <guild> does anyone know what skunk's post about guild lines is supposed to mean?? it makes zero sense to me
[Aug 6-08 21:6:25]Yang <guild> not sure ill go check it out boss
[Aug 6-08 21:6:41]Piehl <guild> dang skunk and his not making sense :P
[Aug 6-08 21:7:29]Nulvect <guild> I seriously don't know what he's even talking about, heh
[Aug 6-08 21:7:29]Yang <guild> errr that one gots me stumped
[Aug 6-08 21:7:47]Yang <guild> maybe he dont talk on his guild's line
[Aug 6-08 21:10:30]Yang <guild> BAM! wish granted
[Aug 6-08 21:10:34]Yang <guild> hehe
[Aug 6-08 21:10:48]Yang <guild> someone owes me a stat calculator
[Aug 6-08 21:10:52]Skunk <guild> party lines and honey lines aren't usually listened in on by imms
[Aug 6-08 21:11:8]Skunk <guild> would like my guild line to be like that
[Aug 6-08 21:11:40]Yang <guild> aww ok
[Aug 6-08 21:11:56]Yang <guild> you can always reject (imm's name)
[Aug 6-08 21:12:2]Yang <guild> hehe jk
[Aug 6-08 21:12:6]Skunk <guild> heh
[Aug 6-08 21:14:1]Nulvect <guild> hmmm, trying to think of an elegant way to do that
[Aug 6-08 21:14:29]Skunk <guild> code wise or politics wise?
[Aug 6-08 21:14:35]Nulvect <guild> code wise
[Aug 6-08 21:14:39]<guild> Skunk nods.
[Aug 6-08 21:14:55]Nulvect <guild> I can easily turn them off, but sometimes we need to talk to members of a specific guild
[Aug 6-08 21:15:5]Nulvect <guild> so we need a way to temporarily turn it back on
[Aug 6-08 21:15:15]Skunk <guild> you usually do have them off
[Aug 6-08 21:15:35]Skunk <guild> could you add yourself to the guild, talk then remove?
[Aug 6-08 21:16:15]Skunk <guild> or would that screw up your primal council stuff
[Aug 6-08 21:16:55]Nulvect <guild> I don't even know how the primal council thing is set up to work
[Aug 6-08 21:17:9]Nulvect <guild> I have an idea how to do it
[Aug 6-08 21:17:13]Skunk <guild> hehe, kind of a smorgasboard of coding eh
[Aug 6-08 21:17:45]Yang <guild> kool then a guild calculator... hehe jk Nul
[Aug 6-08 21:17:51]Yang <guild> errr stat calculator*
[Aug 6-08 21:17:55]Skunk <guild> silly yang :P
[Aug 6-08 21:18:11]Skunk <guild> what do you want to be able to calculate yang?
[Aug 6-08 21:18:15]Yang <guild> just wanna be able to see how much xp it would cost to get me to a certain stat
[Aug 6-08 21:18:47]Skunk <guild> don't they go up each time by a set %?
[Aug 6-08 21:18:55]<guild> Yang aims to kill in Elven Village one day
[Aug 6-08 21:19:15]Nulvect <guild> k, I have no problem with the line thing, but it won't be done until after the event
[Aug 6-08 21:19:25]Skunk <guild> no worries on time, thanks nul
[Aug 6-08 21:29:32]Nulvect <guild> I removed your post skunk, I have it on my own board, just remind me in a week or so
[Aug 6-08 21:29:36]Skunk <guild> k
[Aug 6-08 22:18:25]Yang <guild> hey Nul i got a question if you still around?
[Aug 6-08 22:18:31]Yang <guild> and no not about a calculator

[Aug 8-08 20:25:33]<guild> Yang wants to change our colors
[Aug 9-08 0:57:32]Yang <guild> or maybe a guild item? wax freezer
[Aug 9-08 0:58:4]Bellos <guild> could put you in a freezer
[Aug 9-08 0:58:24]Yang <guild> yeah but no one eats frozen bugs anymore
[Aug 9-08 0:58:34]Yang <guild> not without hot sauce at least
[Aug 9-08 0:59:14]Pyro <guild> hrmm

[Aug 9-08 1:2:26]Pyro <guild> I customized it to red, and now the entire thing is red
[Aug 9-08 1:2:44]Pyro <guild> although maybe it's not because I customized it, if you have the same issue
[Aug 9-08 1:2:56]Bellos <guild> well i dont like red...too much...%^BLACK%^BOLD%^
[Aug 9-08 1:3:28]Bellos <guild> it kinda hurts the eyes right now...

[Aug 9-08 1:3:42]Pyro <guild> =P
[Aug 9-08 1:3:46]Yang <guild> bah
[Aug 11-08 1:8:43]Skunk <guild> i'm confused
[Aug 11-08 1:8:57]Nulvect <guild> if you're about to say something ##!!! you better stop now
[Aug 11-08 1:9:21]Skunk <guild> guild line is censored?
[Aug 11-08 1:11:3]Skunk <guild> i'm a little curious what that word was meant to be nul
[Aug 11-08 1:11:15]Nulvect <guild> to unrinate, with a y on the end
[Aug 11-08 1:12:1]Skunk <guild> well considering my track record with guilds, i suppose i shouldn't say what i was going to then
[Aug 11-08 22:49:47]Cenn <guild> piehl

[Aug 11-08 22:54:19]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Aug 11-08 22:54:21]<guild> Yang believes
[Aug 11-08 22:54:29]Piehl <guild> it freaked me out
[Aug 11-08 22:54:41]Piehl <guild> well not really i'm used to being crazy
[Aug 11-08 22:54:53]Yang <guild> Bruha - Baton Rouge Hunited Hocky Association
[Aug 11-08 22:54:55]Piehl <guild> makes life fun
[Aug 11-08 22:55:13]Piehl <guild> ... dude
[Aug 11-08 22:55:27]Piehl <guild> i've been hearing alot about baton rouge lately and it's irritating me
[Aug 11-08 22:55:47]Piehl <guild> mainly because thats where LSU resides...
[Aug 11-08 22:56:7]Piehl <guild> but also because i've been there ;0
[Aug 11-08 22:56:21]Piehl <guild> does anyone live in LA?

[Aug 11-08 23:2:57]Cenn <guild> I went with Elder - Noble - Death Dealer - Follower, for the moment, anyways
[Aug 11-08 23:2:59]Yang <guild> you ever watch The Kindred : the Embraced?
[Aug 11-08 23:3:25]Cenn <guild> It's a sort of obvious vampire hierarchy
[Aug 11-08 23:3:57]Yang <guild> that works
[Aug 11-08 23:4:37]Piehl <guild> ;0
[Aug 12-08 23:14:17]Nulvect <guild> quick test: pyro, you can use this line, right??
[Aug 12-08 23:14:25]Pyro <guild> yar
[Aug 12-08 23:14:29]Nulvect <guild> thought so
[Aug 12-08 23:34:42]Skunk <guild> would it be amun or nul who sets guild pk rules?
[Aug 12-08 23:38:32]Nulvect <guild> most of our rules have been set before I was an imm
[Aug 12-08 23:38:52]Skunk <guild> wanted to ask a question about guild pk
[Aug 12-08 23:41:1]Nulvect <guild> ok
[Aug 12-08 23:46:58]Skunk <guild> would i ask that question to you nul or to you amun?
[Aug 12-08 23:47:49]Amun <guild> either or
[Aug 12-08 23:47:54]Amun <guild> what's up?
[Aug 12-08 23:47:59]Amun <guild> i've been not really here
[Aug 12-08 23:48:26]Amun <guild> guild pk rules, what about them?
[Aug 12-08 23:48:40]Skunk <guild> just wanted to clarify
[Aug 12-08 23:49:6]Amun <guild> 5 days from the time they were pked
[Aug 12-08 23:49:27]Amun <guild> so if it's 11am today your time, it's 11:01am 5 days later
[Aug 12-08 23:49:33]Skunk <guild> if a member of unholy kills say a member of darksouls, can just that member of darksouls not kill any member of unholy, or is any member of darksouls can't kill an unholy?
[Aug 12-08 23:49:51]Cenn <guild> any member afaik
[Aug 12-08 23:49:57]Cenn <guild> cant kill that smae member
[Aug 12-08 23:50:7]Cenn <guild> i can kill every member of every gulid if i want
[Aug 12-08 23:50:7]Rohl <guild> Is there a limit as to how many total times one character can kill another specific character?
[Aug 12-08 23:50:13]Amun <guild> the person in DS can pk anyone
[Aug 12-08 23:50:20]Amun <guild> if the were the one that was PKed
[Aug 12-08 23:50:45]Amun <guild> ok 1 question at a time
[Aug 12-08 23:50:47]Skunk <guild> <help pvp> e. ii. a Character who has been killed by
[Aug 12-08 23:50:57]Amun <guild> and cenn let me just explain so it's not 20 million people
[Aug 12-08 23:51:1]Skunk <guild> <help pvp> e. ii. a Character who has been killed by another Guild is barred from initiating combat with any member of that Guild until the five day period of wait has passed.
[Aug 12-08 23:51:12]Amun <guild> ok let's do this, Skunk and Rohl have a fight
[Aug 12-08 23:51:38]Amun <guild> Skunk PKs Rohl right now at 11:51pm (lets say this is skunk's time)
[Aug 12-08 23:52:10]Amun <guild> No one in Unholy could PK Rohl
[Aug 12-08 23:52:20]Amun <guild> for 5 days according to time
[Aug 12-08 23:52:25]Skunk <guild> kinda  bad example cause rohl is unholy ;)
[Aug 12-08 23:52:25]<guild> Rohl nods
[Aug 12-08 23:52:31]Amun <guild> but let's pretend
[Aug 12-08 23:52:33]<guild> Rohl pretends to be vorticon
[Aug 12-08 23:52:36]Skunk <guild> nod
[Aug 12-08 23:52:44]Amun <guild> now DS could kill anyone
[Aug 12-08 23:52:52]Amun <guild> and you could kill other memebers of DS
[Aug 12-08 23:53:0]Amun <guild> just those players that have been PKed
[Aug 12-08 23:53:1]Skunk <guild> what about help pvp e. ii?
[Aug 12-08 23:53:3]Amun <guild> are off limits
[Aug 12-08 23:53:45]Amun <guild> that means they cannot start a fight diliberately with the opposite guild in order to get them in trouble and be killed again
[Aug 12-08 23:53:57]Amun <guild> that person is a sitting duck
[Aug 12-08 23:54:1]Amun <guild> for 5 days
[Aug 12-08 23:54:15]Amun <guild> b/c if they attack, who is not going to attack back?
[Aug 12-08 23:54:23]Amun <guild> they can't be used as a "set up"
[Aug 12-08 23:54:41]Rohl <guild> So say I kill member A in darksoul. I cant kill member A for 5 days. But could I kill member B?
[Aug 12-08 23:54:49]Amun <guild> yes
[Aug 12-08 23:54:52]Amun <guild> BUT
[Aug 12-08 23:54:59]Amun <guild> just don't kill A B C D E
[Aug 12-08 23:55:8]Rohl <guild> So there's no guild wars?
[Aug 12-08 23:55:9]Amun <guild> or too many b/c then it's killing spree depending on the time frames
[Aug 12-08 23:55:19]Amun <guild> which is no bueno
[Aug 12-08 23:55:21]Rohl <guild> nods
[Aug 12-08 23:55:41]Amun <guild> does that make the pk thing more clear?
[Aug 12-08 23:55:49]Rohl <guild> Yes, just one more thing to clarify
[Aug 12-08 23:55:53]Amun <guild> yes sir?
[Aug 12-08 23:56:4]Amun <guild> yes you have free reign over cenn at all times
[Aug 12-08 23:56:7]Amun <guild> ;)
[Aug 12-08 23:56:17]Rohl <guild> Would it be considered spree'ing to kill Member A every 5 days, countless times?
[Aug 12-08 23:56:23]Rohl <guild> or is there a limit?
[Aug 12-08 23:56:36]Amun <guild> well, it's not so much spreeing as it is harrassing
[Aug 12-08 23:56:45]Rohl <guild> Cause 5 days gives a player alot of time to xp and get stronger, working towards revenge
[Aug 12-08 23:57:0]Rohl <guild> I suppose
[Aug 12-08 23:57:16]Amun <guild> it does yes, but not really if you have to regain everything ;)
[Aug 12-08 23:57:35]Rohl <guild> So 3 times a good limit?
[Aug 12-08 23:57:35]Rohl <guild> :P
[Aug 12-08 23:57:49]Skunk <guild> what does constitute a spree? is a x number of kills per day? per week?
[Aug 12-08 23:57:53]Amun <guild> i'd say that's fine, but if more than that, it's pushing it
[Aug 12-08 23:58:12]Rohl <guild> I'll just check with the admins first if I get to 3 :P
[Aug 12-08 23:58:12]Amun <guild> you know skunk, that's actually something i've never really understood myself
[Aug 12-08 23:58:17]Amun <guild> that i would check with nul about
[Aug 12-08 23:58:25]Amun <guild> b/c that has always been fuzzy with me
[Aug 12-08 23:58:36]Amun <guild> now when it was vyce
[Aug 12-08 23:58:39]Amun <guild> it was no contest he spreed
[Aug 12-08 23:58:44]Amun <guild> god i loved him HA
[Aug 12-08 23:58:49]Rohl <guild> hehe
[Aug 12-08 23:58:52]Skunk <guild> how many did he kill in what timeframe?
[Aug 12-08 23:58:53]Amun <guild> btw i was kidding about the cenn comment...just in case lol
[Aug 12-08 23:59:1]Amun <guild> he killed many in little time frame
[Aug 12-08 23:59:11]Amun <guild> i dont know exact numbers as that was 2 years ago
[Aug 12-08 23:59:19]Rohl <guild> I could do that if I wanted to get my head cut off by guards :P
[Aug 12-08 23:59:25]Rohl <guild> and get dested for spreeing
[Aug 12-08 23:59:33]Rohl <guild> but I'll pass :P
[Aug 12-08 23:59:53]Amun <guild> but the spree thing as nul
[Aug 13-08 0:0:1]Amun <guild> he may be able to clear that up a little bit
[Aug 13-08 0:0:13]Amun <guild> any other questions i may be able to help with though?
[Aug 13-08 0:0:39]Rohl <guild> I'm good, thanks :)
[Aug 13-08 0:0:53]Skunk <guild> oh yea, are we limited on number of guards, or class of guards?
[Aug 13-08 0:1:15]Amun <guild> wait ok, for inside your guild?
[Aug 13-08 0:1:19]Skunk <guild> yes
[Aug 13-08 0:2:37]Amun <guild> right now i'd say 3 guards would be decent
[Aug 13-08 0:2:44]Amun <guild> do you think you need more than that?
[Aug 13-08 0:3:0]Skunk <guild> not until we can invade other guilds, really no point for any guards till then
[Aug 13-08 0:3:26]Amun <guild> correct no point in them, what I would recommend is holding off on guards for now
[Aug 13-08 0:3:36]<guild> Skunk nods.
[Aug 13-08 0:3:38]Amun <guild> in 6 months we'll have guild changes/addons again
[Aug 13-08 0:3:48]Amun <guild> and if by then we have some sort of invasion in
[Aug 13-08 0:3:50]Amun <guild> then get them
[Aug 13-08 0:4:16]Skunk <guild> maybe i'll go with the better safe then sorry theory ;)
[Aug 13-08 0:4:42]Amun <guild> you could, but i'm tellin you right now don't count on that part being done in 6 months
[Aug 13-08 0:4:48]Skunk <guild> so guild changes will start in a month after you have started school?
[Aug 13-08 0:5:16]Amun <guild> well, i asked ya'lls opinions b/c i want you guys to decide if i start with DS or not
[Aug 13-08 0:5:30]Skunk <guild> i'm fine with waiting, was just wondering on date
[Aug 13-08 0:5:32]Amun <guild> i dont want to make a decision and you guys think it's not fair for them to start
[Aug 13-08 21:45:45]Skunk <guild> noodles eh?
[Aug 13-08 21:45:55]Nulvect <guild> I like noodles
[Aug 13-08 21:46:5]<guild> Skunk chuckles.
[Aug 13-08 21:46:9]Skunk <guild> hows things nul
[Aug 13-08 21:46:27]Nulvect <guild> they're alright
[Aug 13-08 21:46:43]Skunk <guild> you happen to catch the conversation about guild pk rules last night?
[Aug 13-08 21:46:53]Nulvect <guild> not really, no
[Aug 13-08 21:46:57]<guild> Skunk nods.
[Aug 13-08 21:47:11]Skunk <guild> was just looking for a little clarification on help pvp e. ii.
[Aug 13-08 21:47:15]Nulvect <guild> the basics are these:
[Aug 13-08 21:47:55]Skunk <guild> the way i read it, if i'm killed by another guild, i can't attack a member of that guild?
[Aug 13-08 21:48:5]Nulvect <guild> if player 1 is killed in any way by player 2, player 2 may not attack player 1 again in any way for 5 full days, but player 1 may try to take revenge on player 2, after which HE can't attack again for 5 days from that point
[Aug 13-08 21:48:27]Nulvect <guild> if either player is in a guild, it applies to his entire guild rather than just him
[Aug 13-08 21:48:45]Skunk <guild> ahh, e. ii. is a little confusing then
[Aug 13-08 21:48:51]Bellos <guild> so...someone gets killed, goes for revenge, and gets killed again...What then?
[Aug 13-08 21:49:5]Skunk <guild> as long as they attack first tough luck?
[Aug 13-08 21:49:7]Nulvect <guild> then it's his own fault
[Aug 13-08 21:50:7]Nulvect <guild> so say skunk killed, um, cenn... nobody in unholy can attack anyone in vorticon for 5 days
[Aug 13-08 21:50:19]Nulvect <guild> but vorticon can attack unholy
[Aug 13-08 21:50:27]<guild> Skunk nods.
[Aug 13-08 21:50:55]Skunk <guild> also, amun told me to ask you what exactly constitutes a pk spree
[Aug 13-08 21:50:58]Bellos <guild> whoa...we can't attack "anyone" in the guild?
[Aug 13-08 21:51:7]Nulvect <guild> yep
[Aug 13-08 21:51:17]Bellos <guild> eh...that aint right if "any" of them can attack us.
[Aug 13-08 21:51:33]Nulvect <guild> so far as I remember, that's how it's always been
[Aug 13-08 21:52:29]Nulvect <guild> skunk, that's subjective really, but as a rough guide, probably more than 2 pks a day with our player base
[Aug 13-08 21:52:29]Bellos <guild> well...I think perhaps that ought to be looked at maybe?
[Aug 13-08 21:52:37]Skunk <guild> k
[Aug 13-08 21:53:11]Nulvect <guild> I dunno, sounds fine to me... don't pick on the little guys in the guild unless you can take on the big guys too
[Aug 13-08 21:53:27]Bellos <guild> how are we supposed to have guild battles if we touch one member, then our whole guild is open to them attacking but then if they kill one of ours as revenge, we can't even take revenge on them for the vengeance kill in the first place?...now im lost...
[Aug 13-08 21:53:31]Skunk <guild> yea, but what if you want to pick on the whole guild ;)
[Aug 13-08 21:53:39]Bellos <guild> yea that too!
[Aug 13-08 21:53:59]Skunk <guild> if we kill one, then they kill one, does the 5 days reset?
[Aug 13-08 21:54:5]Nulvect <guild> nope
[Aug 13-08 21:54:23]Skunk <guild> so really if we both kill each other on the same day, no one can pick on either guild for 5 days
[Aug 13-08 21:54:33]Nulvect <guild> yep
[Aug 13-08 21:54:47]Bellos <guild> ...ok...thats not too bad then I guess
[Aug 13-08 21:55:1]Bellos <guild> but...We gonna get a system to declare war on other guilds any day in the future you think?
[Aug 13-08 21:55:17]Skunk <guild> amun keeps hinting at it
[Aug 13-08 21:55:27]Nulvect <guild> hmm, sort of
[Aug 13-08 21:55:51]Skunk <guild> although she says daos has been reviewing it for 6 months now, daos claims to know nothing about it
[Aug 13-08 21:56:9]Nulvect <guild> heh, well, daos is daos
[Aug 16-08 0:36:58]Yang <guild> hey Amun can i talk to you when you get a chance, not over any public lines though plz
[Aug 16-08 0:37:8]Yang <guild> bah
[Aug 16-08 0:37:10]Piehl <guild> amuns on? :P
[Aug 16-08 0:37:12]Yang <guild> thought i saw her
[Aug 16-08 0:37:16]<guild> Yang is tweaking
[Aug 16-08 0:37:16]Pyro <guild> lies
[Aug 16-08 0:37:24]Piehl <guild> lay off the acid....
[Aug 16-08 0:38:24]Yang <guild> nah not the cid man its the fried oreos
[Aug 16-08 0:38:34]Piehl <guild> lol
[Aug 19-08 22:18:8]Yang <guild> hehe so if someone is cloaked andleaves your guild you cant tell who it is?
[Aug 19-08 22:18:52]Amun <guild> is it saying shadow on your changes command?
[Aug 19-08 22:19:16]Yang <guild> yeah shadow
[Aug 19-08 22:19:22]Yang <guild> trickey trickie
[Aug 19-08 22:20:10]Amun <guild> nods-
[Aug 19-08 22:21:46]Cenn <guild> i am the shadow
[Aug 19-08 22:22:18]Yang <guild> i still wanna see a giant cloak or be sneaky
[Aug 19-08 22:22:33]<guild> Cenn cides and goes giant assassin
[Aug 19-08 22:22:49]Yang <guild> haha
[Aug 24-08 17:25:24]Ironman <guild> list
[Sep 11-08 1:25:49]Nulvect <guild> new post: smite and his alts are banned from joining any guilds until further notice
[Sep 11-08 1:25:59]<guild> Rohl nods
[Sep 11-08 1:26:9]Yang <guild> umm oops
[Sep 11-08 1:26:31]Nulvect <guild> you won't be punished for that, it was before I officially announced it
[Sep 11-08 1:28:11]Yang <guild> k thnx for the heads up Nul
[Sep 11-08 1:28:37]Rohl <guild> Yesterday smite was about to give all that money to one of my characters that I was on at the time
[Sep 11-08 1:28:43]Rohl <guild> that woulda been bad news for me
[Sep 11-08 1:28:51]Yang <guild> oo
[Sep 11-08 1:29:3]Rohl <guild> he gave it to the guard in tirun [] instead
[Sep 11-08 1:29:11]Rohl <guild> 16m
[Sep 11-08 1:29:15]Yang <guild> wow
[Sep 11-08 1:29:19]Nulvect <guild> nod
[Sep 11-08 1:29:43]Pyro <guild> took me forever to get that money back out... lol..
[Sep 11-08 1:29:53]Rohl <guild> :(
[Sep 11-08 1:29:59]Nulvect <guild> in the past we've just let guilds take care of themselves in that respect, but I think we need to come up with some official rules
[Sep 11-08 1:30:3]Yang <guild> had to do a little dance didnt ya... ive been there
[Sep 11-08 1:30:17]Rohl <guild> nods stuff like that can basically cripple a guild
[Sep 11-08 1:30:41]Nulvect <guild> yes, and there's basically nothing they can do about it
[Sep 11-08 1:32:1]Nulvect <guild> I would have taken all his money, but he has none :P
[Sep 11-08 1:32:35]Pyro <guild> I still say give 'em the ol' human treatment... that sends one hell of a message =P
[Sep 11-08 1:55:28]Nulvect <guild> I don't feel like going into every guild hall, so after reboot at the latest only imms will be able to withdraw from guild treasuries
[Sep 11-08 1:55:54]Nulvect <guild> in the future if you will need to pay for things often we will make an easy payment command for it
[Sep 11-08 1:56:4]Cenn <guild> can it be made so only gold can be deposited then
[Sep 11-08 1:56:8]Nulvect <guild> no
[Sep 11-08 1:56:20]Cenn <guild> but everything is paid for in gold, so if we can't switch it over it'll be really confusing
[Sep 11-08 1:56:50]Nulvect <guild> I will make an exchange command later
[Sep 11-08 1:56:58]<guild> Cenn nods.  thankee babie :D
[Sep 11-08 1:57:16]<guild> Yang wants a guild credit card
[Sep 11-08 1:59:33]Pyro <guild> doesn't the current <balance> command show your total in gold as well as your individual totals?
[Sep 11-08 1:59:49]Cenn <guild> I thought that was only for regular banks, not guild banks
[Sep 25-08 14:18:42]Skunk <guild> list
[Sep 25-08 14:30:0]Yang <guild> list Skunks
[Sep 25-08 14:49:29]Skunk <guild> i'll list you

[Oct 1-08 23:0:53]Cyan <guild> what happened?

[Dec 9-08 12:50:0]Skunk <guild> how are the guild updates going Amun?
[Dec 9-08 12:50:17]Amun <guild> not at all Skunk, as you well know
[Dec 9-08 12:50:33]Skunk <guild> haven't been around much, was just asking, don't get all touchy...
[Dec 9-08 12:50:57]Amun <guild> i didn't it mean it touchy, my apologies that it came off that way
[Dec 9-08 12:51:33]Amun <guild> but I had a butt load of school work, my final is on thursday...then I'm done for a little over a month
[Dec 9-08 12:51:36]Amun <guild> so i'll actually have time
[Dec 9-08 12:51:44]Skunk <guild> that's cool
[Dec 22-08 20:44:23]<guild> Yang is officially insane
[Dec 29-08 20:11:30]Yang <guild> man.. i lose more members this way
[Jan 2-09 13:56:32]Yang <guild> ya know what would be kool, if when you either reject or induct people from your guild you get a special message on the guild line
[Jan 2-09 13:56:56]<guild> Yang shuns Nemo and Mater from Forsaken
[Jan 4-09 18:28:35]Ironman <guild> list

[Jan 4-09 18:30:11]Yang <guild> was actually thinking about guild mergers
[Jan 4-09 18:30:15]Yang <guild> just me though
[Jan 4-09 18:30:29]Yang <guild> i guess it must really be bad if a leader is considering it
[Jan 4-09 18:30:34]Ironman <guild> gotta take that one up with amun.... im builders not guilds
[Jan 4-09 18:30:41]Yang <guild> nod
[Jan 4-09 18:31:15]Ironman <guild> im basically the R&D department :P

[Dec 27-10 15:3:59]<guild> Vian pwns
[Dec 27-10 15:7:53]Skunk <guild> what is the point of the combined guilds treasury?

[Dec 27-10 15:8:33]Skunk <guild> it's got 4.6 mil in it :P
[Dec 27-10 15:8:39]Nulvect <guild> paltry
[Dec 27-10 15:8:47]Skunk <guild> maybe i shouldn't have asked and just emptied it ;)
[Dec 27-10 15:9:3]Skunk <guild> 4.6 mil is a lot of guild addons :P
[Dec 27-10 15:9:27]Vian <guild> ew bold blue is gross but its my color for this line onw
[Dec 27-10 15:9:57]Vian <guild> first action:  bringing back dues.

[Dec 27-10 15:44:27]Skunk <guild> okily dokily
[Dec 27-10 15:44:37]Vian <guild> hopefully wont have any guilds asking me to do like 40 things at a time
[Dec 27-10 15:44:45]Vian <guild> prefer to do it as an over time thing for everyone, a few things here and there
[Dec 27-10 15:45:37]Skunk <guild> how much to add ac to our gauntlets?
[Jan 2-11 18:46:3]Yang <guild> we have to resubmit what we sent to Amun
[Jan 2-11 18:46:17]Vian <guild> check posts on guild leader boards
[Jan 2-11 18:46:23]Vian <guild> i'm doing it a lot uhh calmer than she did
[Jan 2-11 18:46:31]Yang <guild> k
[Jan 2-11 18:46:31]Vian <guild> just gonna play it by ear, not do one guild at a time
[Jan 2-11 18:46:37]Vian <guild> i'll do guild changes as long as guilds want things changed
[Jan 2-11 18:47:21]Yang <guild> we had a few items we wanted to submit
[Jan 2-11 18:47:29]Yang <guild> gotta find thos files
[Jan 2-11 18:47:35]Vian <guild> if its colorful stuff i prefer email
[Jan 2-11 18:47:43]Yang <guild> k
[Jan 14-11 13:3:40]Bellos <guild> list
[Jan 15-11 15:0:42]Bellos <guild> im the only non imm visible on this line!  Gasp!
[Jan 15-11 15:1:4]Nulvect <guild> *boot*
[Jan 15-11 15:1:16]<guild> Bellos cries
[Jan 17-11 14:13:58]A shadow <guild> Abraxas, do you remember how guild dues worked before?
[Jan 17-11 14:14:0]A shadow <guild> Under Amun?
[Jan 17-11 14:14:32]Abraxas <guild> I believe it was 10k a month or something
[Jan 17-11 14:14:40]A shadow <guild> not per player, but just per guild?
[Jan 17-11 14:14:52]Abraxas <guild> the scroll was reset or something i think, so I can't check accurately
[Jan 17-11 14:14:54]Abraxas <guild> per guild
[Jan 17-11 14:15:14]A shadow <guild> Geesh, if people complained about 10k a month when she put dues in, I wonder what they'll say if I charge per player :P
[Jan 17-11 14:15:26]Abraxas <guild> just depends on how much I suppose
[Jan 17-11 14:15:26]<guild> A shadow hides.
[Jan 17-11 14:15:50]Rohl <guild> I will laugh when forsaken shrinks in siize :P
[Jan 17-11 14:15:58]Abraxas <guild> well if its like 200k per player then yeah it'll be kinda sucky
[Jan 17-11 14:16:20]A shadow <guild> I'm thinking every guild will be affected equally from this.
[Jan 17-11 14:16:24]Abraxas <guild> its fine for guilds like unholy, but forsaken likes to be nice to the majority of people and allow them to have fun with helful people
[Jan 17-11 14:16:52]A shadow <guild> Okay guys, if you want to fight about guilds, that should probably happen in tells or on mature or something..
[Jan 17-11 14:16:58]Rohl <guild> I'm just using the population as an example.
[Jan 17-11 14:17:4]A shadow <guild> I'd like to keep this guild leaders line for guild questions, improvements, etc.
[Jan 17-11 14:17:4]Rohl <guild> i'm not fighting
[Jan 17-11 14:17:18]Abraxas <guild> I'm not meaning to sound hostile with what I said, just pointing it out
[Jan 17-11 14:17:28]A shadow <guild> Basically, if its a charge per player, there are 2 different things that could happen.
[Jan 17-11 14:17:40]A shadow <guild> First, I'm guessing guilds will make rules on activity to maintain membership.
[Jan 17-11 14:17:56]A shadow <guild> Secondly, either people will play their alts more often to keep in their guild, or guilds will lose inactive members.
[Jan 17-11 14:18:4]A shadow <guild> Either thing doesn't really seem bad to me.
[Jan 17-11 14:18:43]Abraxas <guild> are you meaning each individual player must pay money to stay in hte guild, or the guild will be charged a sum depending on how many players
[Jan 17-11 14:18:52]Rohl <guild> Naw I wasn't tryin to be offensive was just using the population as an example... assuming quite a few would be inactive enough to get booted
[Jan 17-11 14:19:2]Rohl <guild> that is a good idea too abraxas :P
[Jan 17-11 14:19:14]A shadow <guild> The guild will be charged / member, payable by the guild owner.
[Jan 17-11 14:20:0]A shadow <guild> I will be following Carina's guidelines, but making them a little stricter.
[Jan 17-11 14:21:0]A shadow <guild> Dues will probably be due in the first week of the month, any time.  If not paid in that first week of the month, the guild dues will be due in the next month, with the first month's dues doubled as a late fee and the 2nd month's dues due at the same time.
[Jan 17-11 14:21:12]A shadow <guild> So if you miss month 1, which was 10,000, you will have to pay 30,000 in month 2.  For example.
[Jan 17-11 14:22:2]A shadow <guild> Miss guild dues again, and as with Amun's, you are on probation.  No guild changes can be made at this time, no new items or anything like that.  The same doubling will happen for the 3rd month, so 10,000x2, 10,000x2, 10,000, your 10,000 would become 50,000 total for the 3rd month.
[Jan 17-11 14:22:54]A shadow <guild> Miss the 3rd month in a row, and you lose the guild to another member of it.
[Jan 17-11 14:23:50]A shadow <guild> Any feedback/ideas is great though, I want this to be more of a discussion than me just deciding things.
[Jan 22-11 15:21:57]Vian <guild> Reminder that guild updates are still available
[Jan 22-11 15:22:9]Vian <guild> People used to be knocking down doors for them, and now that they're openly available nobody seems to want them :P
[Jan 22-11 15:22:23]Bellos <guild> guild dues suck
[Jan 22-11 15:22:29]<guild> Bellos harumphs
[Jan 22-11 15:22:41]Vian <guild> I might come up with a new guild dues style
[Jan 22-11 15:22:51]Bellos <guild> no guild dues!
[Jan 22-11 15:23:31]Bellos <guild> guild dues will make us drop down to 2 guilds :(
[Jan 22-11 15:25:9]Vian <guild> nah
[Jan 22-11 15:25:21]Vian <guild> It will drop us to 3, and have one be demolished with space for a new guild to form
[Jan 22-11 15:25:33]Bellos <guild> lemme guess...Last saints nixxed?
[Jan 22-11 15:25:55]Vian <guild> Well, I don't see them paying dues any time soon :P
[Jan 22-11 15:26:9]Vian <guild> And if guild dues are reimplemented, it will really be to make things better.
[Jan 22-11 15:26:29]Vian <guild> Like, anything I do will be planned out, so it will help the health of guilds and the mud in general.
[Jan 22-11 15:27:20]Bellos <guild> hrm...  how is the whole guild wars system comin? or not at all yet?
[Jan 22-11 15:27:34]Bellos <guild> cause i know thats one thing we've been waiting for, for a looooong time
[Jan 22-11 15:27:58]Vian <guild> I have ideas, but it is probably gonna require a bit of coding.
[Jan 22-11 15:28:26]Bellos <guild> well i figured it would be a pretty involved process.  Just wondering if its still being tossed around
[Jan 22-11 15:28:52]Vian <guild> If you saw the size of Nulvect's list of things to do -_-
[Jan 22-11 15:30:6]Vian <guild> I've been working on throwing around ideas for guild war, but it isn't going to come too soon probably.
[Jan 22-11 15:30:14]Vian <guild> Unless I learn to code at a much higher level in a short amount of time ;)
[Jan 22-11 15:31:10]Nulvect <guild> I've got a decent amount of progress going on a war system, but it's not ready just yet
[Jan 22-11 15:31:18]Vian <guild> oh lol
[Jan 22-11 15:31:22]Vian <guild> I'm just super misinformed today
[Jan 22-11 15:32:36]Bellos <guild> hehehe
[Jan 22-11 15:32:58]Bellos <guild> question about the war system...deaths during a guild war still going to be real deaths right?
[Jan 22-11 15:33:24]Abraxas <guild> i would assume not
[Jan 22-11 15:33:46]Abraxas <guild> otherwise nobody would ever do it
[Jan 22-11 15:33:54]Bellos <guild> pfft, says you :p
[Jan 22-11 15:34:6]Abraxas <guild> yeah, says me
[Jan 22-11 15:34:14]Nulvect <guild> part of what I will be doing (but haven't done yet) is adding the ability to control how much you lose from a death during war
[Jan 22-11 15:34:16]Abraxas <guild> you can't have a guild war when only 1 guild wants to participate :P
[Jan 22-11 15:34:22]Nulvect <guild> so the plan is to make it less than normal
[Jan 22-11 15:34:44]Bellos <guild> yes you can Abraxas.  Do you think the whole world wanted war when the Nazi's started one?
[Jan 22-11 15:34:52]Bellos <guild> it takes one power to start a war.
[Jan 22-11 15:35:6]Vian <guild> Also, hopefully, having a guild war be automatically started if a guild PKs another guild, so one guild can't grief another with hardcore deaths.
[Jan 22-11 15:35:10]Abraxas <guild> I don't think there was an all-powerful face that could code things back then
[Jan 22-11 15:35:16]Abraxas <guild> and people who didn't AHVE to be there
[Jan 22-11 15:35:20]Abraxas <guild> it's just a little bit different
[Jan 22-11 15:35:38]Abraxas <guild> the jews couldn't just log off :P
[Jan 22-11 15:35:46]Vian <guild> yes I can :P
[Jan 22-11 15:35:54]Vian <guild> see!
[Jan 22-11 15:35:58]<guild> Abraxas facepalms
[Jan 22-11 15:36:0]Bellos <guild> so for example...Unholy wants to declare war on last saints...and because last saints is pussies and don't wanna fight, we can't war?  that would be lame..
[Jan 22-11 15:36:5]Vian <guild> (be back in about a half hour or so)
[Jan 22-11 15:36:21]Vian <guild> Bellos, how I see it is
[Jan 22-11 15:36:23]Bellos <guild> then no one would ever declare a war...
[Jan 22-11 15:36:29]Vian <guild> If Unholy attacks Last Saints, a guild war is automatically declared
[Jan 22-11 15:36:31]Abraxas <guild> but it isn't lame for all of last saints to be forced to be pked and pk others?
[Jan 22-11 15:36:35]Vian <guild> so if you PK Furiae
[Jan 22-11 15:36:45]Vian <guild> a guild war will be started for 5 days or so
[Jan 22-11 15:36:53]Vian <guild> and it can be ended if both guilds agree to end it
[Jan 22-11 15:36:59]Bellos <guild> isnt that kinda the point Abraxas?  if someone declares war on you, you dont have a choice.  you fight back, or die.
[Jan 22-11 15:37:1]Vian <guild> but if its not ended, all PKs will be less harsh
[Jan 22-11 15:37:13]Vian <guild> Ab, its actually to PROTECT Last Saints.
[Jan 22-11 15:37:23]Vian <guild> The situation is either A: Unholy PKs Last Saints over and over again on full deaths
[Jan 22-11 15:37:23]Abraxas <guild> i personally think its a retarded idea, but whatever
[Jan 22-11 15:37:29]Vian <guild> or B: A guild war is enforced, and deaths hurt less
[Jan 22-11 15:37:39]Abraxas <guild> pk in general is ruining pd, making it more prevelant isn't going to help imo
[Jan 22-11 15:37:55]Vian <guild> This isn't to make it more prevalent, it is to make it hurt less.
[Jan 22-11 15:38:3]Abraxas <guild> hrut less, but happen more often
[Jan 22-11 15:38:17]Abraxas <guild> I assume the "can't pk other people in the same guild" in the 5 days will be removed
[Jan 22-11 15:38:21]Vian <guild> I think it's happening enough already.
[Jan 22-11 15:38:21]Bellos <guild> i think its more other games that hurt PD's player base :p
[Jan 22-11 15:38:35]Bellos <guild> hard for txt based to compete with ps3/xbox etc
[Jan 22-11 15:38:43]Abraxas <guild> so...because other games hurts our player base, we should try to destroy it ourselves? doesn't sound liek great logic to me
[Jan 22-11 15:38:59]Vian <guild> I just don't think you really understand the idea behind this..
[Jan 22-11 15:39:3]Bellos <guild> you're just fit to be tied and stubbord...
[Jan 22-11 15:39:15]Abraxas <guild> i understand exactly
[Jan 22-11 15:39:17]Abraxas <guild> but it doesn't make it any better
[Jan 22-11 15:39:19]Bellos <guild> its guild war, not slaughter every bloody person around
[Jan 22-11 15:39:23]Nulvect <guild> in any case, we haven't yet pinned down all the details
[Jan 22-11 15:39:29]Abraxas <guild> deaths aren't as bad, yet there will be MORE than before
[Jan 22-11 15:39:37]Abraxas <guild> slaughter every bloody person in the guild is exactly what it will be
[Jan 22-11 15:40:17]Bellos <guild> well that is kinda the point of a war...
[Jan 22-11 15:40:23]Bellos <guild> kill yer enemies, defend your allies
[Jan 22-11 15:40:37]Abraxas <guild> and ruin the playerbase, yeah thats great
[Jan 22-11 15:40:37]Abraxas <guild> have at it
[Jan 22-11 15:40:43]Bellos <guild> iv seen guild war systems in other games and MMO's...they don't ruin the game
[Jan 22-11 15:40:53]Abraxas <guild> you can't compare it to MMO's
[Jan 22-11 15:41:5]Abraxas <guild> thousands of players and tens of players are a bit different
[Jan 22-11 15:41:9]Bellos <guild> plus, yer just scurred Unholy will massacre all of Forsaken :p
[Jan 22-11 15:41:15]Nulvect <guild> perhaps we can enforce a (shorter) time period where the one victim can't be touched again, nothing's set yet
[Jan 22-11 15:41:21]Abraxas <guild> if you say so bellos
[Jan 22-11 15:41:25]Vian <guild> I just don't understand why you think we would put something in that would hurt the playerbase.  We're trying to HELP the player base.
[Jan 22-11 15:41:27]Abraxas <guild> just because you don't care about this game doesn't mean I don't
[Jan 22-11 15:41:41]Vian <guild> Nobody said the guild war system will even take out the 1ce every 5 day rule.
[Jan 22-11 15:41:56]Vian <guild> You're just assuming things.
[Jan 22-11 15:41:59]Bellos <guild> if i didnt like PD, would I be here?
[Jan 22-11 15:42:1]Abraxas <guild> then that's !##@@## stupid
[Jan 22-11 15:42:13]Abraxas <guild> if it activates a war for 5 days, but you can't pk for 5 days, what the ###! is the point
[Jan 22-11 15:42:15]Vian <guild> And I think I care about this game quite a bit, I just donated $50 a few days ago to keep it online.
[Jan 22-11 15:42:23]Abraxas <guild> i wasn't talking to you vian
[Jan 22-11 15:42:27]Abraxas <guild> when i said that
[Jan 22-11 15:42:45]Bellos <guild> i been on PD for over 6 years...7 years?.. somethin like that.  I woudlnt have stuck around so long if i didnt like it here
[Jan 22-11 15:42:47]Nulvect <guild> we'll definitely take all these things into consideration
[Jan 22-11 15:42:49]Rohl <guild> PK can also encourage a player base
[Jan 22-11 15:42:49]Vian <guild> You think its stupid and you're complaining and cussing about it because you don't understand it.  We haven't released barely ANY facts about it.
[Jan 22-11 15:43:3]Rohl <guild> its not always negative, some people play muds for that reasons
[Jan 22-11 15:43:5]Abraxas <guild> and the things you HAVE said about it make no !!## sense
[Jan 22-11 15:43:17]Bellos <guild> guild wars can spice things up a little.  something to do OTHER than xp xp xp xp xp xp xp xp
[Jan 22-11 15:43:17]Nulvect <guild> please try to keep things civil here, nobody's going to ruin the game one way or the other
[Jan 22-11 15:44:9]Bellos <guild> cause to be honest...its great and all grinding and training stats and skills and leveling...but...its the same rinse lather repeat all the time then.  throw a war in here and there, we got a little spice and action!
[Jan 22-11 15:44:33]Vian <guild> I will probably not be back in 20 minutes anymore, who knows maybe tonight or something.  If anyone needs anything or wants guild updates, like usual, just mudmail me.
[Jan 22-11 15:44:43]Bellos <guild> latas Vian
[Jan 22-11 15:45:1]Rohl <guild> I'm bein pretty civil not tryin to trip any triggers barely saw this convo just makin pork :P
[Jan 22-11 15:45:35]Bellos <guild> and like Rohl said..PK encourages people too.  Make yourself better, and stronger, so that you cant be so easily killed.  or to get revenge etc etc.
[Jan 22-11 15:46:3]Abraxas <guild> yeah that's worked wonders in the past
[Jan 22-11 15:46:7]Nulvect <guild> PK is a very dividing issue in all online games
[Jan 22-11 15:46:19]Abraxas <guild> just ignore the 50 or so people that have suicided cause some douchebag won't stop pking em
[Jan 22-11 15:46:25]Bellos <guild> i know that had Aziraphale not pked me, i prolly wouldnt be where I am now
[Jan 22-11 15:46:29]Abraxas <guild> pk has SUCH A great track record
[Jan 22-11 15:47:15]Bellos <guild> oh dear...some people can't handle sht...more often than not, those people are whiney, and annoying as hell anyway
[Jan 22-11 15:47:39]Nulvect <guild> I would say the majority of people do not like PK
[Jan 22-11 15:47:41]Bellos <guild> iv been pked 8 or 9 times i think.  Dont hear me complaining about it.   you bounce back
[Jan 22-11 15:48:49]Nulvect <guild> anyway, we'll try to balance it out, we've done ok so far with the different zones thing
[Jan 22-11 15:49:1]Nulvect <guild> I'll be turning this line off now so I can get some stuff done
[Jan 22-11 15:49:5]Bellos <guild> and the majority of people can get bored easily if all you can ever do is xp xp xp xp xp....cause if there's no player-to-player competition in the real realm outside of the arena...well, nuf said if you ask me.
[Jan 22-11 15:49:25]Bellos <guild> zones is an awesome idea, iv always like that
[Jan 22-11 15:49:37]Abraxas <guild> simple enough to expand upon the colosseum
[Jan 22-11 15:49:46]Bellos <guild> thats no fun...
[Jan 22-11 15:49:54]Bellos <guild> can'
[Jan 22-11 15:50:8]Abraxas <guild> ?
[Jan 22-11 15:50:18]Bellos <guild> er, cant do a "suprise!!" when they see you enter colosseum
[Jan 22-11 15:50:44]Bellos <guild> plus, then when in character.  if there is no risk of repercussions, they run their mouth and run their mouth and run their mouth
[Jan 22-11 15:50:52]Abraxas <guild> like i said
[Jan 22-11 15:50:58]Abraxas <guild> simple enough to expand upon the colosseum
[Jan 22-11 15:51:8]Abraxas <guild> "expand upon" doesn't mean keep exactly the same :P
[Jan 22-11 15:51:10]Bellos <guild> expand it all you want...still have to "enter" it.
[Jan 22-11 15:51:22]Abraxas <guild> I'll say it again
[Jan 22-11 15:51:24]Abraxas <guild> "expand upon" doesn't mean keep exactly the same :P
[Jan 22-11 15:51:34]Bellos <guild> then make colosseum deaths real
[Jan 22-11 15:51:40]Bellos <guild> consider it...calling someone out
[Jan 22-11 15:51:40]Abraxas <guild> hence the "EXPAND UPON"
[Jan 22-11 15:52:8]Bellos <guild> but even then...someone will run their mouth run their mouth run their mouth...and refuse to enter the colosseum...and you still can't do anything about it in character
[Jan 22-11 15:52:28]Abraxas <guild> well then they should be forced to enter the colosseum!
[Jan 22-11 15:52:50]Bellos <guild> i view pk as a part of roleplay.  peev me off in real life...w/e, thats OOC.  peeve me off in character, and do it enough...I'll hunt yer arse down
[Jan 22-11 15:53:16]Bellos <guild> i don't kill indiscriminately.  I have a reason for every pk Im involved with
[Jan 22-11 15:53:52]Abraxas <guild> ok thats fine
[Jan 22-11 15:54:8]Abraxas <guild> but when that reason because "because I can", which is all guild wars will boil down to
[Jan 22-11 15:54:8]Bellos <guild> example...I pked Yun recently.  #1, he's an archangle.  War between angels and demons.  #2, he was on merkkerri, lawless zone.  Asmodeus' staked territory, and people have been warned about trespassing there.  #3, enemy guild faction.
[Jan 22-11 15:54:28]Abraxas <guild> enemy guild faction? wtf?
[Jan 22-11 15:54:34]Abraxas <guild> don't make crap up
[Jan 22-11 15:54:42]Rohl <guild> settle down dude
[Jan 22-11 15:54:46]Bellos <guild> i would not declare a guild war "because i can"  id declare a war because another guild pushes buttons and brings it on their own head
[Jan 22-11 15:55:8]Abraxas <guild> settle what down?
[Jan 22-11 15:55:10]Bellos <guild> i didnt make any crap up Abraxas.  Im unholy, all guilds are my enemy but my own
[Jan 22-11 15:55:28]Abraxas <guild> don't assume I'm flipping out and punching holes in my wall over here
[Jan 22-11 15:57:41]Bellos <guild> rmb Ab, i do a little thing called ""RP""
[Jan 22-11 15:58:3]Abraxas <guild> ok?
[Jan 22-11 15:58:15]Bellos <guild> I am Unholy.  It is my goal to spread death, destruction, and darkness.  As well as to increase both our OWN influence, and that of our Patron Lord.
[Jan 22-11 15:58:35]Abraxas <guild> lol, funny part is Asmodeus isn't even supposd to be part of pd
[Jan 22-11 15:58:39]Bellos <guild> any who get in my way, or work towards opposite goals...are my enemies
[Jan 22-11 15:58:53]Bellos <guild> well whether he's supposed to be or not...He is.
[Jan 22-11 15:59:29]Bellos <guild> so unless Merkkerri is gonna sink under the ocean...Asmodeus is part of the realm
[Jan 22-11 16:0:15]Bellos <guild> plus again...Thats the 'RP'
[Jan 22-11 16:0:19]Abraxas <guild> that's all finfe and dandy
[Jan 22-11 16:0:27]Abraxas <guild> doesn't change a single thing I've said
[Jan 22-11 16:0:53]Bellos <guild> we created a guild that has a story to it, a background, and something that we adhere to as towards our goals and general outlook on life in PD.
[Jan 22-11 16:1:9]Abraxas <guild> great
[Jan 22-11 16:1:23]Bellos <guild> just wish more would do that to be honest...
[Jan 22-11 16:1:41]Abraxas <guild> and unholy has been responsible for atleast 2 players quitting in the past month or two
[Jan 22-11 16:1:49]Abraxas <guild> I'm proud  not to be part of that
[Jan 22-11 16:1:53]Bellos <guild> this place would be even more awesome than it is, if more people rp'ed....but enforcing it on the mud does seem to push people away...sadly...
[Jan 22-11 16:2:3]Rohl <guild> yea who quit?
[Jan 22-11 16:2:7]Bellos <guild> yea they quit, cause they can't handle sht.
[Jan 22-11 16:2:9]Rohl <guild> smokey? he wasn't active anyways
[Jan 22-11 16:2:13]Abraxas <guild> atleast 2 of the 4-5 people sopboo pked
[Jan 22-11 16:2:15]Rohl <guild> who else?
[Jan 22-11 16:2:39]Bellos <guild> and there are also people who will play PD, die to a mob...and quit.
[Jan 22-11 16:2:41]Abraxas <guild> and smokey wasn't active?
[Jan 22-11 16:2:43]Abraxas <guild> the sky is orange
[Jan 22-11 16:2:43]Rohl <guild> take it to tells, pk is a part of the game no point in crying about it
[Jan 22-11 16:2:47]Abraxas <guild> i can make stuff up too
[Jan 22-11 16:2:57]Abraxas <guild> yeah its part of the game
[Jan 22-11 16:3:3]Rohl <guild> so stop being a 2 year old
[Jan 22-11 16:3:5]Abraxas <guild> but its not the REASON for the game, which is what you all apparently want
[Jan 22-11 16:3:13]Bellos <guild> did I say that?
[Jan 22-11 16:3:19]Abraxas <guild> you implied it pretty heavily
[Jan 22-11 16:3:37]Rohl <guild> you are talking to an assassin and a thief, both rogue characters, most rogues aren't trusted. I can make stuff up too
[Jan 22-11 16:3:41]Bellos <guild> hrmm...So going from kills are RP based, translates to 'I want a pure pk MUD!'...I dont see it
[Jan 22-11 16:3:45]Rohl <guild> guild line off...
[Jan 22-11 16:4:5]Abraxas <guild> ah so you only RP when its convenient for you rohl? I see
[Jan 22-11 16:4:23]Rohl <guild> I'm being sarcastic towards you and your self-righteous never wrong attitude
[Jan 22-11 16:4:23]Bellos <guild> I rp all the time...cept when I feel goofy.
[Jan 22-11 16:4:39]Abraxas <guild> theres a difference between "never wrong" and "proven fact"
[Jan 22-11 16:4:49]Rohl <guild> whatever you say boss
[Jan 22-11 16:4:51]Abraxas <guild> saying pk has helped the mud is a pure lie, and you know it
[Jan 22-11 16:4:54]Bellos <guild> what proven fact have you presented?
[Jan 22-11 16:5:35]Rohl <guild> I didn't say it has, stop twisting my words. I said it can help attract players
[Jan 22-11 16:5:41]Bellos <guild> i saw no statistics, no numbers...no verifiable reports...yer just saying what you have to say, like me.
[Jan 22-11 16:5:47]Rohl <guild> It gives people incentives, goals
[Jan 22-11 16:5:51]Rohl <guild> in a mud lacking quests
[Jan 22-11 16:6:21]Abraxas <guild> so because we could attract a few players, we should run off a lot of players
[Jan 22-11 16:6:25]Bellos <guild> i said that too!  i got pked by aziraphale, and instead of giving up...It made me push harder to get stronger, so he couldnt do it again...and i could maybe get revenge on that dern angel
[Jan 22-11 16:6:43]Abraxas <guild> well unfortuantely 99% of new mudders aren't you bellos
[Jan 22-11 16:6:51]Bellos <guild> yea...im too cool
[Jan 22-11 16:7:11]Rohl <guild> just settle down
[Jan 22-11 16:7:15]Abraxas <guild> calm down rohl
[Jan 22-11 16:7:17]Abraxas <guild> calm down
[Jan 22-11 16:7:23]Bellos <guild> plus, there is a reason that you can'y pk until after hm...people are informed of this, but if you go into a lawless zone...what do you expect?
[Jan 22-11 16:7:25]Abraxas <guild> you are way too infuriated over this
[Jan 22-11 16:7:38]<guild> Bellos is still cool as a cucumber
[Jan 22-11 16:7:38]Rohl <guild> Yea abraxas taunt me, or you may end up dead
[Jan 22-11 16:7:41]Rohl <guild> stfu
[Jan 22-11 16:7:45]Abraxas <guild> I'm doing exactly what you jsut did
[Jan 22-11 16:7:47]Rohl <guild> and deal with it
[Jan 22-11 16:8:4]Abraxas <guild> you say things that make no sense like "settle down", then I will too
[Jan 22-11 16:8:4]Rohl <guild> yea cause you have no more points to make
[Jan 22-11 16:8:31]Bellos <guild> plain simple fact of the matter is this:  Pk is a part of the game.  If you don't like it, stay outta lawless zones, and don't purposely try to peeve people off.
[Jan 22-11 16:8:38]Abraxas <guild> you assume I'm mad when you have no clue one way or another
[Jan 22-11 16:9:3]Abraxas <guild> whatver, go back to insulting me on your line behind my back like cowards
[Jan 22-11 16:9:19]Rohl <guild> you have dillusions
[Jan 22-11 16:9:41]Bellos <guild> cause iv seen it a lot elsewhere...where pk wasnt allowed.  there would be 2-5 people, that would push everyone else away from the game, because they always ran their mouths and people got tired of having to listen to wankers like that, and not being able to put them in place.
[Jan 22-11 16:9:57]Bellos <guild> actually...Unholy line is pretty quiet...
[Jan 22-11 16:10:46]Bellos <guild> plus, we have better things to talk about amongst ourselve on the line, than you Ab...No offense, but yea...Not exactly the topic of the day as it were ;p
[Jan 22-11 16:11:24]Abraxas <guild> Rohl: "Omg abraxas isn't agreeing with what I'm saying, he must be furious, I'm gonna throw threats at him"
[Jan 22-11 16:11:33]Abraxas <guild> you must feel liek a big man rohl
[Jan 22-11 16:11:46]Bellos <guild> ...that wasnt on the Unholy line...
[Jan 22-11 16:11:53]Rohl <guild> You never agree, because something is wrong with your brain
[Jan 22-11 16:11:54]Abraxas <guild> I didn't say it was
[Jan 22-11 16:11:57]Rohl <guild> and you always have to be right
[Jan 22-11 16:12:0]Bellos <guild> you implied
[Jan 22-11 16:12:1]Abraxas <guild> that's what is happening on THIS Line
[Jan 22-11 16:12:1]Rohl <guild> y ou cant comprimize
[Jan 22-11 16:12:16]Rohl <guild> so shut up or you will end up dead next time you leave a safezone
[Jan 22-11 16:12:16]Bellos <guild> you made a comment about us jabbering about you on our guild line behind yer back.
[Jan 22-11 16:12:24]Abraxas <guild> compromise what?
[Jan 22-11 16:12:27]Abraxas <guild> theres nothing to compromise
[Jan 22-11 16:12:32]Abraxas <guild> and way to prove my point
[Jan 22-11 16:12:42]Rohl <guild> because of that malfunction in your head
[Jan 22-11 16:12:47]Rohl <guild> because its only your way, how you see it
[Jan 22-11 16:12:58]Rohl <guild> Look in at an angle once
[Jan 22-11 16:13:0]Abraxas <guild> ah and you are so different
[Jan 22-11 16:13:11]Bellos <guild> actually...nothing was proven there Ab...just that you peeved someone off, and now they might do something about it...Its just like life.  Treat someone like sht, they're gonna pay it back.
[Jan 22-11 16:13:18]Abraxas <guild> lol
[Jan 22-11 16:13:35]Abraxas <guild> treat someone liek @!#!@ not sucking his ##!# is treating him like #@###
[Jan 22-11 16:13:35]Bellos <guild> plus, its even MORE like life...Cause this is turning into a hen fight...
[Jan 22-11 16:14:0]Abraxas <guild> i said i disagreed, and rohl started his period and started throwing around threats
[Jan 22-11 16:14:8]Rohl <guild> um
[Jan 22-11 16:14:11]Rohl <guild> okay
[Jan 22-11 16:14:16]Rohl <guild> I said one thing
[Jan 22-11 16:14:34]Abraxas <guild> one?
[Jan 22-11 16:14:40]Bellos <guild> I haven't made any threats whatsoever.  I'v just been trying to have a civil conversation about issues concerning the MUD
[Jan 22-11 16:14:42]Abraxas <guild> just one?
[Jan 22-11 16:14:48]Abraxas <guild> I never said  you did bellos
[Jan 22-11 16:14:51]Abraxas <guild> I specified rohl
[Jan 22-11 16:15:4]Bellos <guild> I know...But I still feel like the elephant in the living room
[Jan 22-11 16:15:24]Rohl <guild> Abraxas just shut your mouth for once
[Jan 22-11 16:15:30]Abraxas <guild> Rohl just shut your mouth for once
[Jan 22-11 16:15:48]Bellos <guild> ok...I think both of ye just need to chill for now...even if I am kinda chuckling on my end of things
[Jan 22-11 16:15:48]Abraxas <guild> just because I don't agree with everything you say doesn't make me wrong
[Jan 22-11 16:16:2]Rohl <guild> I'm not saying you are wrong, I'm saying you are always right
[Jan 22-11 16:16:10]Abraxas <guild> I have no problem with pk, the simple fact is I don't think making something that encourages MORE pk is going to help anything
[Jan 22-11 16:16:16]Bellos <guild> (there is a difference between disagreeing with eachother, and outright insulting eachother for having different views...)
[Jan 22-11 16:16:32]Abraxas <guild> and judging by pd
[Jan 22-11 16:16:36]Abraxas <guild> pd's history
[Jan 22-11 16:16:43]Abraxas <guild> guidl wars is only going to hurt in the long run
[Jan 22-11 16:17:40]Bellos <guild> a guild war system doesnt necessarily promote more pk...cause while you CAN pk the other guild more, they can turn around and pk you back just as much.  Its like life again.  If you're a leader, you can declare war whenever you wish...but you don't.  Mutually Assured Detruction.  Could be a factor within the bounds of PD as well.
[Jan 22-11 16:17:50]Rohl <guild> everyone is complaining about the player-base. look at it once
[Jan 22-11 16:18:0]Rohl <guild> plus a few shadows
[Jan 22-11 16:18:6]Rohl <guild> it is flourishing more than it has
[Jan 22-11 16:18:10]Abraxas <guild> you know good and well this is far above average at the moment
[Jan 22-11 16:18:14]Bellos <guild> speaking of player base...I think Im owed a pat on the back.  I made Lilka come back to PD!
[Jan 22-11 16:18:14]Rohl <guild> why is it such a dire situation?
[Jan 22-11 16:18:46]Bellos <guild> it got stagnant around here...same players always idling, tired of xping and nothing else to do
[Jan 22-11 16:19:20]Bellos <guild> no ultimate goal beyond "Gotta get my stats to ladada" or "gotta make it to elite!" or "Imma go Legend!"
[Jan 22-11 16:19:20]Abraxas <guild> so join a guild and be forced into a war!
[Jan 22-11 16:19:32]Bellos <guild> join a guild, to be part of something
[Jan 22-11 16:19:58]Abraxas <guild> and I feel that "part of something" will only end up being "part of war"
[Jan 22-11 16:20:4]Bellos <guild> plus, even if they put a guild war system in...Yer making it sound like it will be NONSTOP...which is unrealistic
[Jan 22-11 16:20:16]Abraxas <guild> I don't think it is unrealistic
[Jan 22-11 16:20:48]Abraxas <guild> with people like baine/sopboo running around pking just because they feel like, I don't really see a point where eveyr guild isn't always on the brink of war
[Jan 22-11 16:20:58]Abraxas <guild> keep in mind, I have no problem with sopboo
[Jan 22-11 16:21:2]Rohl <guild> they pk because people are in rhon dude
[Jan 22-11 16:21:4]Abraxas <guild> known him for years and I think he's an alright guy
[Jan 22-11 16:21:8]Rohl <guild> dont go to rhon
[Jan 22-11 16:21:10]Bellos <guild> then...no offense, but yer a little conceited :p  No one would want to be constantly at war.  Not even Unholy.  But if we're given a reason to wage war, we would.  We don't get reasons like that every day, or week, or even every month.
[Jan 22-11 16:21:10]Rohl <guild> and you will be fine
[Jan 22-11 16:21:22]Abraxas <guild> don't go to the best xp area in the game? and sometimes the ONLY good xp area in the game?
[Jan 22-11 16:21:50]Rohl <guild> get stronger or stop complaining. oh wait you dont have a rogue to leach off of
[Jan 22-11 16:21:56]Abraxas <guild> ah
[Jan 22-11 16:22:2]Abraxas <guild> must be so proud of yourself
[Jan 22-11 16:22:6]Abraxas <guild> making the easiest class in the game strong
[Jan 22-11 16:22:6]Bellos <guild> Unholy stakes territory...part of being in a guild, people working together to do something of worth for themselves as a group
[Jan 22-11 16:22:24]Rohl <guild> says the dragon
[Jan 22-11 16:22:26]Abraxas <guild> lol
[Jan 22-11 16:22:32]Abraxas <guild> and I'm the delusional one
[Jan 22-11 16:22:34]Bellos <guild> hey, iv put a lot of time and effort into being an assasin Ab...
[Jan 22-11 16:22:42]Abraxas <guild> I udnerstand that
[Jan 22-11 16:22:48]Rohl <guild> go walk into a knife teenager
[Jan 22-11 16:23:4]Abraxas <guild> lol
[Jan 22-11 16:23:12]Abraxas <guild> internet tough guy, man you must feel so manly
[Jan 22-11 16:23:14]Bellos <guild> plus...assassin wasnt always like it was now...i used to suck HARDCORE.
[Jan 22-11 16:23:24]Abraxas <guild> calling people teenagers and trying to start #!!@
[Jan 22-11 16:23:32]Abraxas <guild> assassins have never sucked
[Jan 22-11 16:23:32]Abraxas <guild> ever
[Jan 22-11 16:23:36]Bellos <guild> I'll be a tough guy face to face!!!  Im the Mad Russian!  FEAR THE BEARD!
[Jan 22-11 16:23:38]Abraxas <guild> atleast not in PD2 history
[Jan 22-11 16:23:46]Bellos <guild> they werent as good as they are now
[Jan 22-11 16:23:56]Abraxas <guild> i disagree
[Jan 22-11 16:24:16]Abraxas <guild> there has alwasy been a thief/assassin that is retardedly strong
[Jan 22-11 16:24:18]Bellos <guild> when I was still Human for example, before going demon...I could xp decently...But i couldnt compete against other players worth crap in the arena or pvp.
[Jan 22-11 16:24:18]Abraxas <guild> always
[Jan 22-11 16:24:34]Abraxas <guild> seth being one of the first coming to mind
[Jan 22-11 16:24:50]Abraxas <guild> and faust being one of the first ones
[Jan 22-11 16:24:56]Abraxas <guild> soulfly
[Jan 22-11 16:24:58]Rohl <guild> so this isn't about pk? its about you not being able to get strong enough to ever make a difference?
[Jan 22-11 16:25:10]Bellos <guild> here we go again -__
[Jan 22-11 16:25:14]Bellos <guild> er -_-
[Jan 22-11 16:25:14]Abraxas <guild> you're the one who brought up "being strong" into this rohl
[Jan 22-11 16:25:16]Abraxas <guild> stop being a child
[Jan 22-11 16:25:38]Rohl <guild> either way, he's dead
[Jan 22-11 16:25:44]Bellos <guild> to be honest...yer both contributing to the argument/disagreement(w/e you wanna call it)...
[Jan 22-11 16:25:44]Rohl <guild> :P
[Jan 22-11 16:25:48]Rohl <guild> line off
[Jan 22-11 16:25:52]Abraxas <guild> make a class that isn't overpowered strong rohl
[Jan 22-11 16:25:58]Abraxas <guild> then start throwing threats around
[Jan 22-11 16:26:0]Abraxas <guild> till then teenager, shut up
[Jan 22-11 16:26:12]Bellos <guild> any class can be overpowered, its how much work you put into making yourself strong
[Jan 22-11 16:26:26]Rohl <guild> I have been stronger than you on every class i've played seriously
[Jan 22-11 16:26:28]Abraxas <guild> bellos, me and you were talking normally, then rohl throws in "get stronger or stop complaning"
[Jan 22-11 16:26:32]Bellos <guild> well...cept maybe Gypos :p
[Jan 22-11 16:26:34]Abraxas <guild> lol
[Jan 22-11 16:26:40]Rohl <guild> we were fighting before that
[Jan 22-11 16:26:46]Abraxas <guild> yeah, kataan and rogue, you worked soooo hard getting strong
[Jan 22-11 16:26:53]Rohl <guild> monk
[Jan 22-11 16:26:54]Rohl <guild> swash
[Jan 22-11 16:26:56]Rohl <guild> douche
[Jan 22-11 16:27:0]Abraxas <guild> your 20 hours of gaming a day
[Jan 22-11 16:27:2]Abraxas <guild> get a life?
[Jan 22-11 16:27:4]Bellos <guild> i should remort anti-pali and raise some hell...
[Jan 22-11 16:27:12]Rohl <guild> oh okay
[Jan 22-11 16:27:12]Abraxas <guild> see, I can throw stupid insults liek a child around too
[Jan 22-11 16:27:14]Bellos <guild> anti's got better havent they?
[Jan 22-11 16:27:32]Abraxas <guild> and yes bellos, anti's are pretty good with nulvect's recent changes
[Jan 22-11 16:27:54]Bellos <guild> hrm...might have to give it a try, after finishing with my current task...
[Jan 22-11 16:28:32]Bellos <guild> and honestly...I wish i could have u 2 on camera or something, or just the words and animate it...Could make a good sitcom here :p
[Jan 22-11 16:28:48]Abraxas <guild> and rohl is just proving my point, throwing aroudn threats and pking "cause he can"
[Jan 22-11 16:29:18]Bellos <guild> er...he's a thief, and not an overly friendly one...he throws threats around a lot...kinda part of the territory
[Jan 22-11 16:29:18]Abraxas <guild> somebody blows their nose wrong around him and he throws a @@@!! fit
[Jan 22-11 16:29:20]Rohl <guild> and you just keep bringing me up to keep it going, sandy vag
[Jan 22-11 16:29:24]Abraxas <guild> #!!#@@!@ bellos
[Jan 22-11 16:29:30]Abraxas <guild> he doesn't roleplay
[Jan 22-11 16:29:38]Abraxas <guild> unless its CONVENIENT for him to
[Jan 22-11 16:29:50]Bellos <guild> using that logic though, you could say the same for me
[Jan 22-11 16:29:54]Rohl <guild> wtf are you talking about lol
[Jan 22-11 16:30:2]Bellos <guild> since I talk to people OOC in says etc etc...
[Jan 22-11 16:30:22]Abraxas <guild> using "im a thief" as a reason to pk people and push your weight around is pure @#!!@###
[Jan 22-11 16:30:26]Abraxas <guild> rohl doesn't rp
[Jan 22-11 16:30:30]Bellos <guild> and am actually 'civil' with people while around.  but if I rp'ed 100% all the time, no one would want to talk to me.
[Jan 22-11 16:30:38]Abraxas <guild> he acts the exact same every character he's ever played
[Jan 22-11 16:30:50]Bellos <guild> what.  Evil?
[Jan 22-11 16:30:50]Rohl <guild> so do you, like a whiney little prehormonal ###!#
[Jan 22-11 16:31:0]Rohl <guild> you are just trying to ##!! us off, so we kill you
[Jan 22-11 16:31:4]Abraxas <guild> hypocrisy at it's finest, huh rohl?
[Jan 22-11 16:31:10]Rohl <guild> so you can cry more, and get us in trouble with your dad or nul
[Jan 22-11 16:31:20]Abraxas <guild> grow up rohl
[Jan 22-11 16:31:28]Rohl <guild> how about you, stop bringing up my name
[Jan 22-11 16:31:32]<guild> Bellos can Pk Ab, without repercussion
[Jan 22-11 16:31:36]Abraxas <guild> then stop being an ass?
[Jan 22-11 16:31:46]Abraxas <guild> me being stormys son has NOTHING to do with anything bellos
[Jan 22-11 16:31:48]Abraxas <guild> it never has
[Jan 22-11 16:32:0]Bellos <guild> ...i never said anythin about Stormy Ab...
[Jan 22-11 16:32:24]Bellos <guild> Thought for how long we've known eachother you'd know better than that :p
[Jan 22-11 16:32:30]Abraxas <guild> if I was ANYHTING like the kind of person you assume I am rohl, you really think baine would still be here?
[Jan 22-11 16:32:36]Abraxas <guild> meant rohl bellos
[Jan 22-11 16:32:38]Abraxas <guild> my bad
[Jan 22-11 16:32:42]Bellos <guild> i don't bring thigns from real life into the MUD...metagame
[Jan 22-11 16:33:6]Abraxas <guild> and if I was ANYTHING liek the kind of person you assume I am rohl, I would have had a dragon loooooong before the event came out
[Jan 22-11 16:33:36]Abraxas <guild> fact is, rohl is just a scrawny basement-dweller who acts tough behind his keyboard
[Jan 22-11 16:33:48]Bellos <guild> ...i think I take offense to that...
[Jan 22-11 16:33:52]Rohl <guild> lol okay
[Jan 22-11 16:33:56]Bellos <guild> cause i WISH i was a basement dweller!
[Jan 22-11 16:34:16]Rohl <guild> now you are just making yourself look bad
[Jan 22-11 16:34:18]Rohl <guild> keep goin
[Jan 22-11 16:34:20]Bellos <guild> but im not scrawny anymore either...bulked up from doing my job...
[Jan 22-11 16:34:38]Abraxas <guild> you sure aren't good at comitting rohl
[Jan 22-11 16:34:42]Abraxas <guild> just can't keep the line off can you?
[Jan 22-11 16:34:52]Rohl <guild> I shouldn't have to
[Jan 22-11 16:35:14]Bellos <guild> honestly, im kinda suprised we haven't been told to take this convo elsewhere :p
[Jan 22-11 16:35:24]Abraxas <guild> nul and vian are idle
[Jan 22-11 16:35:34]Bellos <guild> Nul turned the line off didnt he?
[Jan 22-11 16:35:42]Abraxas <guild> that too
[Jan 22-11 16:35:50]Bellos <guild> when did whit login...

[Jan 22-11 16:36:40]Bellos <guild> anyway...I'll bbl, i wanna watch my dern movie, and eat, then come back.
[Jan 22-11 16:36:48]Abraxas <guild> and bellos, I've known you since you started playing, and I'm not trying to soudn hostile to you
[Jan 22-11 16:37:26]Bellos <guild> heyheyhey, i was dancing around the outskirts of the disagreement/spat going on...Im not offended by anything said
[Jan 22-11 16:37:48]Bellos <guild> and I'll only be hostile if given a reason to, in game...you know that
[Jan 22-11 16:38:32]Bellos <guild> course....That being said, don;t suprise me in a lawless zone, cause I would have to do something then...(i dont like being spooked)
[Jan 22-11 16:39:10]Bellos <guild> and no...that wasnt a threat.  just saying, don't jump outta a bush yelling SUPRISE!!!
[Jan 22-11 16:39:56]Bellos <guild> anyway...movie time, and we can yell at eachother again later k :p
[Jan 22-11 16:40:26]Abraxas <guild> well if he starts something again I'm going to defend myself of course
[Jan 22-11 16:40:58]Bellos <guild> well yea...be kinda conceited to say 'dont defend yerself'
[Jan 22-11 16:41:6]Rohl <guild> so he could whine about getting pk'd
[Jan 22-11 16:41:18]Abraxas <guild> you bet
[Jan 22-11 16:41:22]Abraxas <guild> go eat more cheetohs
[Jan 22-11 16:41:28]Rohl <guild> lol
[Jan 22-11 16:41:40]Bellos <guild> i can't eat cheetohs... :(
[Jan 22-11 16:41:40]Rohl <guild> go tell me what a !@@!@@ feels like
[Jan 22-11 16:42:0]Abraxas <guild> wouldn't be hard, I could describe a wet paper sack adn you wouldn't know the difference
[Jan 22-11 16:42:12]Bellos <guild> man p\/ss or she-p\/ss?
[Jan 22-11 16:42:36]Abraxas <guild> between all your "hardcore" 20 hour xp sessions, I doubt you get out much anyways
