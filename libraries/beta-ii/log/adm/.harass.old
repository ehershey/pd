%^CYAN%^You look over the %^BLUE%^%^BOLD%^male%^RESET%^ %^CYAN%^demon%^RESET%^.
Yakko sees you've taken an interest in him and shoots you a goofy grin.  At 3'3" this little animainiac seems nothing more than a joke, with his goofy grin and lanky demeanor making his apperance rather comical. But behind that big goofy grin he's just waiting for you to turn your back to him.  Waiting for you to take your eyes off of him, convinced of his harmlessness.  Waiting to reveal the sharp pointed horns, and thrust the dagger he's been hiding, deep into your back.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Yakko has a burn mark the shape of a circlet across his forehead and temples. 
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^An inscription in the burn reads: Annar Tilin%^RESET%^
Yakko is married to Tia.

Nulvect <newbie> sure thing
Tcevlun <newbie> instead of saying u'd make a good imm
Nulvect <newbie> I'm gone now
Tcevlun <newbie> should have listened to everyone else when everyone said you'd make a crappy imm, good builder, crappy leadership skills
Tcevlun <newbie> well, he handled that well for not being law
Tcevlun <newbie> amazing how he can play favorites and make my point very clear
Zubadubanub <newbie> lol, he shouldnt say stuff that isnt true
Tcevlun <newbie> chron gets arrest, i accept that, get on spade ask him why i got arrested and he arrests spade
Zubadubanub <newbie> cuz i could care less bout playin here, and anyway i wasnt gonna have whit get me outta trouble
Zubadubanub <newbie> all cuz i asked if he isnt law why is he arresting :(
