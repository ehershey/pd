You die.

You arrive at a destination in a reality not like your own.
Sin dies a horrible death.
You unwield newbie Sword (wielded).

%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^A blue, almost black mist swirls around you. A floating sensation floods your senses. You can feel that you no longer have a physical body, be that for the better or worse. Your ghost sores high above your dead body. You feel yourself falling...

%^RESET%^You feel confused and a bit scared.

The Reaper looks up at you and says: I know you want to get back to the mortal world to get revenge..
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Spirit says:%^RESET%^ But knowing you, I don't think it'll be that long before I see you back here again.
%^RESET%^You frown disapprovingly.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Spirit says:%^RESET%^ I know, it must be depressing.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Spirit says:%^RESET%^ Just to make you feel a little better, I'm going to tell you the secret of life..
The Reaper clears his throat and opens his mouth to talk.
A voice in your head says: Primal Darkness-II calls for you..
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Spirit says:%^RESET%^ Oh! Too bad.. Your time here has run out.. Time for you to go back.
The Grim Reaper's Spirit waves to you.
The dead are incapable of such acts.

[1m[37mTirun Market Square.[0;37;40m
The square is dark and quiet.  Dark forms moving in the darkness lend evidence
that at least some creatures roam the night.  Shadows along the side of the road
to the east and west coalesce into buildings.  The stones underfoot are hard to
make out and things look different in the darkness.  The road seems to travel
north, west, and east.  An opening in the fence to the south leads into a well
lit area.  


%^GREEN%^There are four obvious exits:  north, south, west, and east.

%^ORANGE%^You feel at peace here.%^RESET%^
[36mTirun Central Park[0;37;40m
The park of Tirun is situated in the center of market square.  It is a place of
peace and rest dedicated to the Gods of the realm.  The bustling activity of the
town does not encroach upon this place.  Not even time invades this sanctuary of
the Gods.  A magnificent fountain of a dragon dominates the center of the park. 

A peaceful silence permeates this place.
