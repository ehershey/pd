sentence. Also, you should put a comma in the second sentence: "It is a place of
peace and rest, dedicated to the gods of the realm." You could additionally drop
out 'upon this place' ... since it's implied that it IS this place by the
context. Also, drop 'Not' from the start of the next sentence since it confuses
the meaning; instead, use 'Even time does not invade ...'
