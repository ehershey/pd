/d/sewers/rooms/2lv38: With elemental system, it could be cool to have opposing elements. For instance, if you have 30% fire resistance, you loose 15% cold resistance. This would make it harder for a character to have 100% resist to all.

/d/sewers/rooms/bottom7: "Jar of Preservatives", or something, costs around 100,000 gold, and autoloads.  You can open it, put a limb in it, and close it, and seal it.  Then the limb will stop decaying, and it still autoloads.  A neat little trophy type thing, and a money sink

/d/sewers/rooms/2lv17: I just wanna praise this mud as a new player, love the idea of quest races it is something to achieve for. A lot needs to be fixed but I feel there are active immortals working a lot and seeing some new improvements over days all the time. This place is vital and hope it will be so. At a later stage it might be adviceable to try to actively recruit more coders so the development of the game will continue beautifully like a small creek turning into a stream which in turn turns into a lake. Love the mud thanks for the good work.

Bug reported by Janos:
/d/sewers/rooms/35: Charge won't let you do anything for a full round after it
hits. You cannot even check the damage done by the command. It gets corrupted by
later idles and possibly specials.
