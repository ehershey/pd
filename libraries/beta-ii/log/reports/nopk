/d/nopk/tirun/square: New remort system, where you are set at level 1 either way.  You either keep 3 of your stats and have the other 3 set at 2 each, or keep 1 ability/spell.  Sure, this could leave assassins with boost, but they would have had to work hard for it.  If you pick 1 ability/spell, your stats are force-rolled at level 1.  You can only remort 3 times, and if you pick stats the first time, you have to pick it the second and third, if you pick ability/spell, you need to pick those the second and third.  You can only have 2 remort ability/spells, the third remort you have to lose one of the first two.  If you go angel/demon/lich/vampire/dragon after remorting for abilities, you lose those abilities after you become your new race.

Typo reported by Masada:
/d/nopk/tirun/square: tirun park/[] The typo of 'Gods' in the second sentence of
the room's general description conflicts with the spelling of 'gods' in the
inscription on the plaque. <see previous typo report> Pick one way (lower case
is proper) and stick with it. Same for the occurence of "Gods" in the fourth
sentence. Also, you should put a comma in the second sentence: "It is a place of
peace and rest, dedicated to the gods of the realm." You could additionally drop
out 'upon this place' ... since it's implied that it IS this place by the
context. Also, drop 'Not' from the start of the next sentence since it confuses
the meaning; instead, use 'Even time does not invade ...'
Typo reported by Masada:
/d/nopk/tirun/square: firepit in Tirun [] "This large pit is used by players to
discard unwanted items. The less-fortunate scavencge them from time to time, and
put them to new and sometimes better uses."
Typo reported by Masada:
/d/nopk/tirun/square: Lighting a fire in Tirun []: currently, takes the player's
object file name and appends and 's' (eg, 'Carinas fire comes to life.') The
closer-to-proper method would be to use an apostrophe-s, which announces
ownership. This will still be wrong in the case of a name ending in 's' or 'x,'
but it'll be much closer to right.
Typo reported by Masada:
/d/nopk/tirun/square: Tirun [] fountain. "The workmanship of the fountain is
(spectacular, magnificent, outstanding).  In fact, it may be the finest you've
ever seen in your entire life. Its centerpiece is a statue of a mighty dragon,
symbol of Tirun's strength and steadfastness in battle. Water pours from the
dragon's mount into a pool at its feet. A gold plaque has been mounted here."
