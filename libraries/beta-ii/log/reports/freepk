/d/freepk/rhondale/rooms/zforest/x25y9: when a pyro casts shroud it says he
creates it around you, even if you are not the one he is attacking. For instance
if a pyro and I teamed up to exp his casts on a monster would still read that he
is creating a shroud around me.

/d/freepk/rhondale/rooms/zforest/x16y4: When I use sense, it tells me Kra'toan
hunters are neutral but they bring my alignment down if I kill them. Could their
sense monster please be changed to reflect this? Thanks.

Bug reported by Cyan:
/d/freepk/rhondale/rooms/zforest/x21y13: oops, well.. on wimpy. I was hit to
take my hp below my wimpy, and I used psidrain, which took me back above my
limit. But then, for for the next 4-6 rounds, it said I was unable to do
anything. My idles wouldn't even go, and so now, I lost all my gear somewhere in
Rhondale.

/d/freepk/rhondale/rooms/zforest/x8y15: Vigor It doesn't give me a message when
it runs out, only the person with vigor. Not sure if it's a bug or not, but I
feel I should know when it wears off too.

/d/freepk/purgatory/room/guest23: not a pure bug, but some bosses in purg castle
aren't any harder than the trash monsters. the barbarian warmaster for instance
