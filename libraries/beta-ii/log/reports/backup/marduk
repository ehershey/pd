/wizards/marduk/mine_shaft/ms_room13: I can backstab while resting
Typo reported by Nesoo:
/wizards/marduk/mine_shaft/ms_room13: "The flesh of the corpses here, have
started to rot, and bone shows through the rotting flesh of some corpses."
"corpses here, have started" s/b "corpses here has started"
Typo reported by Nesoo:
/wizards/marduk/mine_shaft/ms_room14: "and all that remains is bare, naked
walls, and piles of bones." "is bare, naked walls, and" s/b "are bare walls and"
I removed "naked" in that fix since it's redundant.
Typo reported by Nesoo:
/wizards/marduk/mine_shaft/ms_room12: "fresh limbs, and corpses" No comma
needed.
