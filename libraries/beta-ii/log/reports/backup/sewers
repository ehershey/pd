/d/sewers/rooms/2lv17: perception Lower the costs on perception. I have calculated out that to raise it by 20 points as a level 10 white dragon, it cost me in the neighborhood of 3 million.  I'm level 10! That is just insane.  And since stealth raises so fast that you can go from 5 - 200 in less then two minutes without spending a single XP on it. It becomes even more incredulous.
