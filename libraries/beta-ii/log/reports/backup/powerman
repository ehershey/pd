/wizards/powerman/room/patha: Either make these mobs in Dunsinane worth 150k (but don't raise their level), or make them not use abilities. These mobs are SO BS! You cannot kill them. I was in here with everyone casting their defense spells on me and I still took 2k damage in a round because one mob walked in and 8 guys slashed/rushed me instantly. Remember that a level40 mob that uses abils is harder than a level40 mob that doesn't. Yet both give the same exp for killing them. Also, WTF is up with the eq, it weighs more than anything else in the game, it SUCKS for the difficulty of getting it, and it is worth almost NOTHING. This is the worst exp place in the entire mud, and I am including purgatory in my comparison there. I'd get more exp jsut expn in Arlon for crying out loud. This area may have been ok in PD1 when palyers got so buff it wa stupid, but it doesn't balance right on PD2. *Rant off*
