/d/tirun/clergy/monk/monk_hall: i think that the xp reducements for players that are killing mobs far below their level should be increased.  put on a progressive system.  for example, mod more than 15 levels below you 75% xp, 25 levels below 50%, 35+ levels 25% xp.  hopefully this would force the higher level players to do 2 things.  explore the mud more and to stop fighting in area that are better suited to players that are lower levels.  it is difficult for players of lower levels to gain decent xp when there are players that are levels 30, 40, or even 50+ killing in areas that were designed for levs in the teens or eairly 20's.  higher levels killing there occasionally is one thing, but when they are constantly clearing an area that was designed for lower levels they always beat out the people that are supposed to be killing there, leaving them with nothing to kill.

you in greenish streaks across the black sky.  As you try to leave, you
notice a huge, dark figure hovering before you. The figure seems to be an old
and powerful spirit. The spirit has two firey pin points for eyes, but is
otherwise undiscernable besides a long shadowy robe.  The Spirit says:

says: Since you're new here, I am the Grim Reaper. You know damn well who you
are, so I won't bother saying your name again. Lac <newbie> wtf? The Spirit
says: This is the first time you have died, and I feel for ya. I remember
when I first died.. The Spirit says: Okay, listen. I know how you feel and
I'm the type of guy who understands that sort of thing, and I'm sorry for
you, but there's not much I can do. You feel confused and a bit scared.  The
Reaper looks up at you and says: I know you want to get back to the mortal
world to get revenge.. The Spirit says: But knowing you, I don't think it'll
be that long before I see you back here again. Tendrick <newbie> ack! You
frown disapprovingly. The Spirit says: I know, it must be depressing. The
Spirit says: Just to make you feel a little better, I'm going to tell you the
secret of life.. The Reaper clears his throat and opens his mouth to talk. A
voice in your head says: Primal Darkness-II calls for you.. The Spirit says:
Oh! Too bad.. Your time here has run out.. Time for you to go back. The Grim
Reaper's Spirit waves to you. You feel yourself falling, then suddenly you
find yourself in a familiar place. Lac <newbie> that was wierd.. To end

but as a demon i discovered that i could use them by a simple change in command,
if i wear all, or wear ties, it will not work, BUT if i just change it to 'wear
ties on tail' i can wear them, i like having a lil more protection but it is
ment for centaurs only so it should be fixed.

/d/tirun/square: Rage(for demons) ok how about this, for gore to be in Melee rage and melee rage only, u need max melee for lvl 25, 125 ferocity, and max attack, i think that is 150 attack,125 ferocity and 150 melee, and maybe rage should be a lvl 20 or 30 ability, for starters its not that useful at low levels and it is pretty good except for the good chance of dying. As for Massacre i'd say lvl 50 maxes in ferocity, melee, attack and... 50 str... just trying to make it a lil more realistic for u guys
Idea reported by Aldur Sun Aug  4 16:23:55 2002
/d/tirun/square: ferocity say at lvl 25 max ferocity, rage would disregaurd some of the lower abilities like jab, whirl and headbutt... because really they don't do much at all, i'm not even sure if headbutt does anything at all.

/d/tirun/pubstart: death I think that when PlayerA kills PlayerB, PlayerB should have a smaller death penalty (stats, skills, etc.) than they would have if they were killed by a monster.  Why?  Because, harassment has always been an issue with PK.  If someone was PKed 3 times in a row, it could cause them to want to quit playing.  But they probably WOULDN'T be killed by the monster three times in a row.  I don't think players should have that kind of power over other players.  I mean, killing another player for RP and such is good, but if it is done simply to punish another PLAYER, that's just wrong and out of the spirit of fair play.

/d/tirun/clergy/kataan/kataan_hall: (auction command) Can the auction command be changed so that when a person auctions an item, there is another message that asks "At what price do you wish the bidding to start at" so that once the person sets a price, thats it and he/she cant bid anymore.  This would in theory reduce the time and spam of auctions.

/d/tirun/rogue/rogue2: Well, was in the Western tower of Northern Lodos, and had
just entered the top floor where the baron and two paladins are. Arrived there,
then was killed by a shadow, and it said I was killed by the Wolf Master. I know
a few other people had the same thing happen to them, and earlier in the day,
people were getting teleported to random locations. I got teleported from the
oasis to the assassin hideout. So, hopefully that helps. If someone feels the
need to throw me a few thousand for lost equipment, I won't complain. ;)

Typo reported by Kurgan:
/d/tirun/rogue_hall: HELP SKILLS Last sentence: Spell are heavily... Correction:
Spell should be plural i.e. "spells".

Bug reported by Kurgan:
/d/tirun/rogue_hall: Seems to be a bug regarding wielding weapons. After
death, I retrieved equipment, which included two blood sabres. In order to
DUAL wield, I had to specify a hand to wield the second in. So, wield sabre
and wield sabre 2 didn't work. Wield sabre wielded my first sabre, but in
order to wield the second, I had to type "wield sabre 2 in left hand". Just a
bit odd.

Bug reported by Oosen:
/d/tirun/square: I accidently made a nickname mob mob, but now when I try to
remove it, I am told that 'No such nickname defined.' even though nickname still
lists it. This makes setting up aliases difficult (i.e., "who's mob?").
