/d/arena/looser: I think we should add more things to the paintball arena such as. 1. Maybe some traps like triplines that slow down people from running, 2. sniper towers that let you use sniper turrets to hit players in far away rooms, 3. a paint grenade (maybe 1 per game?) that when thrown, it sets a timer of about 7 seconds for you to get out of the area and when the timer expires it will explode and hit every player in the area adding 1 point for each target hit to the thrower.

almost never cast lifetap, lifewarp, levin, hurt, pain. They all come up with
"!ERROR! This is a bug  etc". I can cast any spell on monsters, but not in
players. Not sure if this is a player or arena thing since I am not game to
attack someone out of arena.

Bug reported by Cookie:
/d/arena/arena5: I don't know this for sure, but I do believe that, with a
crystal amulet, when you die and it breaks, you come back to life, the angel
kills death and the thing you were fighting, and life moves on. Well, it should
anyways. However, being a berserker that got me thinking about what we do best,
Rage. If you are raging, and the amulet breaks, you come back to life, the angel
fights death... but wait?! You're still raging... so you now attack both
death... and the angel. A super, can't hardly be beaten angel. And he will kill
you alot, in a big ole hurry. Something should be done to make sure you can't
attack death or the angel when you come back to life while in rage. Thanks! Keep
up the good work.
