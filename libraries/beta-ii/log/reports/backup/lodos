/d/lodos/wtower3: scorch spell is bugged I think.  I have 100 (max) in magic
attack, but the  scorch spell will still fail every now and again.  I think
the failure rate is maybe every 1 in 30 or 50 times I cast it.  I don't think
it should fail that much when my skill is maxxed and at 100 right?  -Staver
