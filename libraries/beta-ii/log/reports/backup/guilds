/d/guilds/illuminati/prayer: This happened to me and loki and we both use
dispell as our main attack. When we were fighting a mob we tried to run away and
suddenly we couldn't do anything. We could not wimpy out, we could not move out
ourselves, we could not use abilities or cast spells, we couldn't use oils or
stones. For me it happened when I cast dispell, then tried to wimpy in the same
round. Before that I was fine, after that all I could do was spin halo, lucky
for that hmm?

Bug reported by Ashram:
/d/guilds/darksoul/view_room: druids are very very strong. as their attacks are
instant it saves them 1 round over mage spells everytime. this means that
icestorm in the sewers, merk, tenebrae, or lodos is about as effective as having
shroud around lvl 25. Icestorm/earthmaw are extreemly strong for exp purposes.
As thornwrack is instant damage it is very strong as well, but it doesnt add as
much as icestorm/earthmaw does. The same is most likely true about psistorm as
well. Druids get 4 defense per level which is easy to raise and with vine armour
they take almost no damage. at lvl 25 i was killing rooms with 4 28k mobs with
no trouble at all. at lvl 35 i could icestorm the king's room in tenebrae. at
lvl 50 i took only 50 damage per round from the entire king's room per round.
Combined with area attacks this made druids insanely powerful

insanely high right now. With backstab+stab i insta-kill 25k mobs at lvl 40.
