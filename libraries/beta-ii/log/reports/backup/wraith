Bug reported by Wraith:
/wizards/wraith/workroom: Minor bug, Ive tried everything I can to the gags to
make it so you cant reclaim them from a locker. The gag itself stays in your
inv, but when you reclaim it from the lockers you just get another gag. Ive made
it so players cant give it to people and updated a few other commands. Stormie,
or nightshade, can you guys look at the locker sys (I aint fucking with it) and
see if you can set something up for the gag when you have time.
