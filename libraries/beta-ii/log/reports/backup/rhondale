Idea reported by Wraith Sat Mar  8 19:05:52 2003
/d/rhondale/keep/rooms/zforest/path95: Well, hers an idea for backstab. As you know its shoving a large sharp object into something. Well I was thinking about this and I came up with an idea that I dont know if its in play or not. When a backstab hits, you can let it do normal damage if it hits extremities like arms, feet and such, but if it hits a vital part (torso, head) it would increase the damage because the knife just went into a vital organ. I dont know how much more it would do, mebbie double a normal backstab or so. or at least a 300 hp boost for a vital hit.
