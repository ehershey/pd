Bug reported by Enigma:
/d/guilds/ethereal/hall: in the sand castle there is a bug, when you enter
the sand castle you cannot exit, and there is no message that tells you that
the doorway has somehow dissapeared. Also, the description says that it is 4
feet tall, yet it is two stories, there is no way my character could fit in 2
ft of a room. Also, when you try to go up to the third story you appear
outside without any type of message telling you that ymagic was involved.
This is very comfusing for us players with no imagination. thank you for your
time.

Bug reported by Aziraphale:
/d/guilds/illuminati/rooms/armshop: In the Illuminati armour shop, when I use
sell all the mud instantly crashes and resets.  I sold each individual item
in my inventory that could be sold here, except for some boots that I buried,
and it was fine. I am thinking it could be something to do with how the mud
handles objects that are being worn/wielded, or something.

us to our new hall and just delete the old one completely?

/d/guilds/illuminati/rooms/scry: When a character cides, if they
automatically remake under the same name, they are still in the guild they
were in before. This makes it so that another player could remake another
person's charcter and end up in a guild without ever being properly
"inducted" into the guild.

/d/guilds/darksoul/view_room: blue dragon's breathe is too overpowered as a pk
spell, it paralyzes 100% of the time, drains sp and mp to -200, this stops

aziraphale provided they have shrunken heads or some other mana regen

can't recall the part of the code that contains the error.

possible.  I never use this many...  so I'm not gaining from it if it's a
bug.  They just end up dropped in my hall.  Thanks  Leviathas
