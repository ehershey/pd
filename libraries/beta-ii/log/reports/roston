Bug reported by Aziraphale:
/d/roston/drow/room/room59: If you are in combat with a player, you still get
idles off on them in Tirun.
Bug reported by Aziraphale:
/d/roston/drow/room/room90: you can use hte ability 'kill' while charging. So
you can get idle hits in while waiting for charge to hit.
Bug reported by Aziraphale:
/d/roston/drow/room/room4: if you try to use maul andit fails due to low SP, you
still begin combat with your target
Bug reported by Aziraphale:
/d/roston/drow/room/room20: When someone is forcequitted from the freezer, they
show up as having jsut left the realm over buddylist and enemylist. Can it be
changed so that if they quit form that room, it doesn't show up? It gets a
little irritating thinking that you only *just* missed talking to someone, when
they havne't even been on for 4 hours.
Bug reported by Aziraphale:
/d/roston/drow/room/room20: Illuminati has access to the saangreals, they were
meant to be locked out. Dunno what happened there. I think I already reported
this on e to Stormy but I dunno, maybe it was a tell and he didn't get it.
Bug reported by Aziraphale:
/d/roston/drow/room/room85: drow still wield their weapons on heartbeat, rather
than create.
Bug reported by Aziraphale:
/d/roston/drow/room/room59: Nothing big, the command maul has an extra "\n"
newline at the end of it's paralyzation message. It just creates more lines on
the screen that don't really accomplish anything. Ithink it might look better if
the line wasn't there, because it would make maul look more like a part of
combat.
Bug reported by Nulvect:
/d/roston/rooms/r_crack: the text display of your exp (You ALMOST have
enough..blah blah) in cost command is usually nowhere near correct, for example
I'm maybe 3/4s now and it says ALMOST there
