Bug reported by Uzamaki:
/d/distopia/room/nexus: Amun tells me that all healing items share the same
source code. But, I was fighting a brigand and got from 870 hp down to 251. 3
oils fully restored my hp. Fought another brigand and had my hp reduced to 316.
It took 9 souls from the Darksoul hall to restore hp to 870. It did exactly 60hp
every time without fail. Would you be so kind as to look into this for me? Thank
you.
