Bug reported by Dage:
/d/lodos/ltower6: when using choke, sometimes the mob continues to be choked
after I receive the 'Guard breaks out of your grasp!' messages. Usually, the npc
will be choked a few more times, then I will begin attacking but the npc doesn't
swing back. This is just generically using 'choke guard' in Lodos.
Typo reported by Dage:
/d/lodos/ntown7: the exit to the west in this room is 'door' the door to the

/d/lodos/armoury: Please implement a system for manipulating 'all' of an object type in the players inventory.  For example: put all.sword in backpack, would put all available sword in the inventory into the backpack.  Alternatives could be: put sword all in backpack.  It seems that put sword 2 in backpack already works, adding the 'all' argument shouldn't require too much coding (then again, I  know nothing).
