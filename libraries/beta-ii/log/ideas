/d/tirun/square: with the <body> command.  i think that when i limb gets
severed it should show the lime and where it normally has the % it should say
something like "SEVERED!" it would be alot eaiser.  as it is, when i limb is
severed it just doesnt show it on body list at all you have to look at yourself
to figure it out or remember what limb it was that got severed.

/wizards/detach/forbiden/rooms/room18: after a certain point mobs should 
stop having exp cuts. For example a 52k mob on the bfields will always be 
plenty hard to kill even if i'm level 100. The damage they do alone slows 
people down as much as an exp cut would. I say mobs bigger than 50K 
shouldnt get cut. just my thoughts tho

Idea reported by Aldur Sun Aug 4 16:21:50 2002 /d/tirun/square: Rage(for 
demons) ok how about this, for gore to be in Melee rage and melee rage 
only, u need max melee for lvl 25, 125 ferocity, and max attack, i think 
that is 150 attack,125 ferocity and 150 melee, and maybe rage should be a 
lvl 20 or 30 ability, for starters its not that useful at low levels and 
it is pretty good except for the good chance of dying. As for Massacre i'd 
say lvl 50 maxes in ferocity, melee, attack and... 50 str... just trying 
to make it a lil more realistic for u guys

Idea reported by Aldur Sun Aug 4 16:23:55 2002 /d/tirun/square: ferocity 
say at lvl 25 max ferocity, rage would disregaurd some of the lower 
abilities like jab, whirl and headbutt... because really they don't do 
much at all, i'm not even sure if headbutt does anything at all.

Idea reported by Leviathas Sun Aug 18 16:06:38 2002 /d/tirun/pubstart: death I think that 
when PlayerA kills PlayerB, PlayerB should have a smaller death penalty (stats, skills, 
etc.) than they would have if they were killed by a monster.  Why?  Because, harassment has 
always been an issue with PK.  If someone was PKed 3 times in a row, it could cause them to 
want to quit playing.  But they probably WOULDN'T be killed by the monster three times in a 
row.  I don't think players should have that kind of power over other players.  I mean, 
killing another player for RP and such is good, but if it is done simply to punish another 
PLAYER, that's just wrong and out of the spirit of fair play.

I was in here with everyone casting their defense spells on me and I still took 2k damage in a round because one mob walked in and 8 guys slashed/rushed me instantly. Remember that a level40 mob that uses abils is harder than a level40 mob that doesn't. Yet both give the same exp for killing them. Also, WTF is up with the eq, it weighs more than anything else in the game, it SUCKS for the difficulty of getting it, and it is worth almost NOTHING. This is the worst exp place in the entire mud, and I am including purgatory in my comparison there. I'd get more exp jsut expn in Arlon for crying out loud.

When a backstab hits, you can let it do normal damage if it hits extremities like arms, feet and such, but if it hits a vital part (torso, head) it would increase the damage because the knife just went into a vital organ. I dont know how much more it would do, mebbie double a normal backstab or so. or at least a 300 hp boost for a vital hit.

/d/nopk/tirun/sage_room: Offenses should have a time limit. After like a year in game time... 1 major offense should be removed... or like, 3 minor offenses. Maybe remove 1 minor offense every 4 months or so. Major offenses have the priority, so minor offenses won't disapear until the major offenses are gone. Kinda like you have to pay off your biggest crime first in real life. Anyways... just my thought. thanks.

Sure, this could leave assassins with boost, but they would have had to work hard for it.  If you pick 1 ability/spell, your stats are force-rolled at level 1.  You can only remort 3 times, and if you pick stats the first time, you have to pick it the second and third, if you pick ability/spell, you need to pick those the second and third.  You can only have 2 remort ability/spells, the third remort you have to lose one of the first two.

/d/nopk/arlon/room/stoneshop: Name Policy I think it would be very beneficial to put the name policy as step 1 right before name confirmation before a new character is made. I think it would be pretty easy to implement, and it would help with the influx of bad names we've been having lately.

/d/lodos/armoury: Please implement a command which repeats the last command entered. For example: put hammer in backpack, !, !, !, !.  Where ',' represents another command and '!' represents the 'repeat' command.  This would put 5 hammers in the backpack.

/d/lodos/armoury: Please implement a system for manipulating 'all' of an object type in the players inventory.  For example: put all.sword in backpack, would put all available sword in the inventory into the backpack.  Alternatives could be: put sword all in backpack.  It seems that put sword 2 in backpack already works, adding the 'all' argument shouldn't require too much coding (then again, I  know nothing).

/d/shadow/rooms/tene10: specials Hey Nul what do you think about random specials for either race, or subclass? like for fighters "you lean / shift your weight making your attack stronger" or "you reach further toward your opponent making your spell stronger/ or you drain a bit of their mp"... I can talk a bit more about it when you get back on
