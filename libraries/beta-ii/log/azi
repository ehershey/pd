home
/wizards/nightshade/workroom
You have entered Nightshade's room.  There is very little     |         
floor space, as it is covered in junk and dirty clothes.  A   |        
large flag is hung on the wall over the closet, and his       |     [X]
dresser is covered in various knicnacks.                      |        
                                                              |         

Despite the dirty laundry, it smells pretty good in here.
Any footsteps are softened by the clothes beneath.

There are three obvious exits:  square, hall, and stormy.

A large, plush bed is here.

<Hero> Jacie <illuminati> @/\_ it's about these two americans that get sent
over to aus on a job assignment, which (they don't know) is to deliver their
own death warrant _/\@

<Hero> Jacie <illuminati> @/\_ and the knagaroo's part in the whole movie is
when they hit a knagaroo and then they think it's dead, and they start joking
around and putting a jacket on it and taking pictures, and then it wakes up and
hops off with the very important death warrant that they have to deliver in the
jacket pocket _/\@
<Legend> Helena <illuminati> O|< he likes...bubbles... >|O
