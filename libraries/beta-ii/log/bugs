/d/nopk/tirun/square: I set traps in the arena. Morta tripped them when I wasn't
inside and it counted as an act of war. Outside, I walked in the room and killed
him. Please make it so arena traps dont cause real combat, please? Thanks

/d/nopk/tirun/locker: This is Cyan, I remorted back to my paladin after a good
while. And I am taking rediculously increased dmg than last I remember as
paladin. I removed all my EQ, then put it back on. Then even quit out, and came
back on. So  I don't know if it's a bug with me, or if the paladin's have been
changed horridly. If so, having 180+ Dex with godspeed, and 180 strength. Losing
500-800 lp a round to drows when I used to lose like 300 is a major red flag.
Thank you, and get back at me when you can

/d/freepk/rhondale/rooms/zforest/x21y13: oops, well.. on wimpy. I was hit to
take my hp below my wimpy, and I used psidrain, which took me back above my
limit. But then, for for the next 4-6 rounds, it said I was unable to do
anything. My idles wouldn't even go, and so now, I lost all my gear somewhere in
Rhondale.
