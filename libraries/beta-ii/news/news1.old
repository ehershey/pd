  A lot of changes have  taken place recently.  Many new and changed
  spells & abilities  are  in  or about to be in,  skills  have been
  updated  removing  some skills  from  some  subclasses as  well as
  changing the amounts per skill and new areas  are in review by the
  staff to  be put  in the  game  soon.  The staff  and builders are
  working a lot of hours to bring  these changes  and updates to you
  and  I  just  wanted to  personally say  thanks for doing  such an
  awesome job. I would also like to thank the players for taking the
  time to come  play in this world,  your world.  If I said we do it
  all for the players I would  be lying.  We do it  because this  is
  what mudding means to us, the staff.  I think  we are on the right
  track.  If you have any  issues  with  the changes  made recently,
  your subclass board  is the best  place to  do so.  Remember to be
  nice, we read all boards and respond when needed. 
 
                            Till next time!
