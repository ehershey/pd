The following list are most of the frequently asked questions people new
to Primal Darkness have.  Be sure you have read this whole thing and know 
that your question is unanswered before you go asking someone else.  
Everyone here is happy to help you, but you must understand that answering 
the same question over and over again when it is well documented is a bit
annoying.  That is why we have this faq document. Do not actually type the
< or > listed in this document, that is a highlight to show you what to 
type.

The method will vary from guild to guild.  You should talk to a member
of the guild you want to join to find out the process for that guild.
Remember that each guild on Primal Darkness is meant only for a certain
resricted group of characters, so a guild good for one player is not
necessarily good for another player.
 
5) Have you seen player X?
 
There are several ways to see if someone is on Pd. One of the following
commands should retrieve the information you want. <who> , <finger>, 
<finger [player X]> remember to replace [player X] with the players name.
 
6) Why can't I wield this weapon?
 
You might have a shield worn on the hand you are trying to wield the weapon 
in. If you still cannot wield the weapon, try <wield [weapon] in [right]
hand> replace [weapon] with the weapon name, and [right] with the hand you
want to wield it in. Raknids have first hand, second hand, third hand, and
fourth hand all other races should have left and right hand. All weapons are
skill based, if you can't use a weapon after trying the above suggestions,
try raising the weapon skill of the weapon you are trying to use.
 
7) Is player killing allowed?
 
Yes, player killing is allowed but there are limits. There is a justice 
system in play and it can be harsh on criminals. Player killers are 
criminals. Player killing is an evil act and your alignment will reflect
that. If your alignment is not right for your class or subclass, you could
loose your spells or abilities. Player killing is not allowed until a player
reaches hm, this means you can't kill someone and someone can't kill you 
until you reach level 20. 
 
8) How many quests do I have to do?
 
You do not have to do any quests if that is your choice. Quests are totally
voluntary. Quests award players with different "prizes". The prizes vary,
but can be anything like money, stats, skills, experience, a new race, etc.

10) What do the stats and skills mean?
 
Stats are numerical representations of your basic physical make-up, which
is determed by your racial heritage.  These stats are used in different
relevant aspects of your mud life.  Consitution determines how sturdy you
are.  Intelligence determines your capacity for using magic.  Dexterity 
determines your nimbleness in combat.   Strength determines how much
you are able to carry.  Wisdom determines your resistence to offensive magic.
Charisma factors into your ability to get by normally aggressive monsters 
and in the buying and selling of goods.

you are at something.  We have weapon skills, magic skills, attack skills,
and deception skills.  Weapon skills determines your proficiency in weapon 
types.  Magic skills determines your proficiency in types of magic.  Attack
skills determines your proficiency in your ability to attack and defend.

you earn is not alot but the system allows you to play and grow without 
having to fight. Type <help delivery> for more information.
