Weapon specials have been restored for the weekend, they will be disabled for
bug fixing again on Monday.
 
Double XP Weekend is happening now! Until midnight Sunday night all kills are worth double the experience points. We are also holding reboot until after the event is over. Enjoy and have fun!
