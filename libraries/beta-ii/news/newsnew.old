We updated room exits recently. Now in some rooms non standard exits like building entraces or the gate will appear on a new line we call the entrances line. An example is the three shops located 1 north and 1 west of the square. Before the entrances to those shops were just the directions north, northwest, and west. Now, when you enter the room there is a new line of info that looks like this: %^GREEN%^There are three entrances: armour shop, supply shop and weapon shop.%^RESET%^ We are making these changes to make room exits and entrances a little easier to understand and for builders to have more choices when naming room exits and entrances.

So please, be a bit careful when you are mudding until you are used to the new exits and the changes we are making. I would hate to see someone die beacause they were not paying attentions and tried to flee through an old exit. 

The wimpy bug has been fixed... we think. Please let us know if you have any trouble with it. I will do what I can to help anyone recover if it bugs again, so long as you let us know how it failed you.
