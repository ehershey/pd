%^BOLD%^%^RED%^ATTENTION:%^RESET%^

Due to circumstances outside of our control we've had to do
an emergency upgrade to the latest stable FluffOS driver.
This is our first attempt of running a new driver since the
last stable release of MudOS in December of 2003.

With the upgrade we hope for the best but expect the worst.
A remote backup has been taken so rest assured your player
data is safe.

Over the next few days please let an immortal know of any
problems that you find as well as using the bug command
to report the problem as well.  Hopefully everything will
be smooth from here on out.
