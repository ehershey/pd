However, the Dark Elves took exception to this and staged a trap- they kidnapped his wife, Arelle, but promised her safe release for ten years of service. Zar, without too much choice, agreed to their terms. Using relics the Dark Elves had crafted from the body of a great Red Dragon, they transformed him into a half-dragon, a horridly scarred fighting machine. It was a price he was prepared to pay for the release for his wife, however, he found out too late that they had used her to perfect the technique... Zar swore revenge, but was bound by the Dark Elven magic to complete his service. He changed his name to Vexgall the Caged, his situation frequently causing him to loosing himself to uncontrolable anger, a perk in the eyes of his Dark Elven masters.");
