Stormbringer's Walk-through Results:
 
 
Many rooms in level 1 have the word _you_ in the room description, that is not allowed. 
 
Many rooms use the phrase seem to or seems to or both at once. I noticed most times it is not needed.
 
Small spelling mistakes such as 'congregation of bird' should be 'congregation of birds'
 
Items use set_value(10); instead it should be set_curr_value("gold", 5); like the weapons
 
I assumed this was a newbie area because you want it located so close to Tirun. If it is to be placed in the tirun bay, all mobs need to be dropped to be between levels 1 and 10, maybe one or two level 15 bosses, with warnings of some sort. I will not connect this to Tirun with level 60 mobs in it. Either drop the levels or delete all reference to being close to Tirun so I can put it off an island. It will not be added until the above problems are cleared up.
