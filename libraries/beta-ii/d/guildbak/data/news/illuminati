%^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^I've done a clean up of our members list. Any members that were "Mortals" that I have not seen online in the past 2-3 months have been removed, unless I know that you have an active alt that you are playing. Anyone I have removed is free to join again, they just have to talk to me or Blits or Aziraphale. If you see that one of your alts has been removed, please inform me and I will induct that alt again and reimburse you for any lost guild equipment. Thanks.   %^RED%^~Scourge~
