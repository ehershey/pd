The Grinch this year has decided to do things a little differently.  He is
going to send his minions to get all of the decorations around tirun which will
be strategically placed in Tirun.  They will invade from the mountains to the
west.  I will place the grinches cave somewhere upthere close to lodos. 
Players will have to fight the monsters from getting all of decorations.  

They will purposly fail.  I will have the monsters overrun them and get all the
decorations.  The players will then have to go up to the grinch and take them 
back.  The grinch himself will be around level 30 but with max hp.
