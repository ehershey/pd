You come to a room with hanging vines, jump on it

There are three adjacent rooms, with a vine in the middle. The middle room is in the middle of a cave.
the only way to get from one end room to the other is by swinging on the vine. The vine moves you from
one room to the next every 2 seconds. If you jump off in the middle, you fall to your death. If you
jump off on an end, you end up in that room, and the vine appears back in the middle.

make some kind of complicated method to move the vine from the middle room to a side room.


a dog that shoots bees out of his mouth

you cannot attack him, because of some reason

have to find some way to keep his mouth shut

-when his mouth is shut, the bees damage him instead of flying into the room. There is a beequeue, saying how many bees are in his mouth. He gets damaged accordingly each heartbeat.

when he dies, send a message about a great pillar of bees being released into the sky

there is a hole underneath where the dog was laying down. In the first room, there is a beehive that spawns bees.

When the player picks it up, it still spawns bees. they need to bury it to destroy it and stop the bees from spawning.

this is where we get to the trembly cave part, where they are crawling and the cave collapses beneath them. Some passeges are good, some are bad.
