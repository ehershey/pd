Napa - evil mage, slave tells me that her cousin, Melany from the
	mainland, knows of a way to destroy the mage. "Tell her I 
	sent you" if I say 'mainland' she'll say: "*sigh* I remember
	when Mel and I would just sit and talk on that fountain of a
	dragon.."
Tirun - Melany tells you that her adventuring days are over, besides,
	she needs her locket in order to help you out, she lost it years
	ago while fishing with her father, who is now dead. Only he knew
	where they were, but she remembers the huge arowana she caught.
Sorn - Get the locket, return to Mel, she tells me coords to a place
	where a man that can help me is.
