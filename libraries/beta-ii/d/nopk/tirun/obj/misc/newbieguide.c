"as well as build the realm.  We try our best to be on call 24/7 so that we can be on hand "
"in case of problems, bugs, etc.  Alot of newbie questions are answered in the FAQ so if "
"you have not yet read the FAQ you should type %^CYAN%^<faq>%^RESET%^ once you are done reading this "
"article.  PD has a help system that is designed to be newbie freindly, typing "
"%^CYAN%^<help topics>%^RESET%^ will show you a list of all the help topics in the help system. We have "
"tried to include everything in the help system but with so many user commands, abils, "
"spells, etc it is hard to get them all. If you find you need help on something not "
"included in the help files, please ask a staff member or ask your question on the newbie "
"line.  Anytime text in this directory appears inside %^CYAN%^< >%^RESET%^ it means the text inside the %^CYAN%^< >%^RESET%^ is a command.\n\n"

"Equipment are the items you use in your travels around PD. In order to be at your best, "
"you will need armour and weapons as well as a few other items of gear.  Not all the "
"equipment is essential to play Pd but it will make your experience more enjoyable.  "
"Listed below is the gear availible to use in Pd, know that the list is not complete but "
"should help you in getting started.\n\n"
"%^CYAN%^[ Armour ]%^RESET%^\n"
"Armour in the game is used to protect your character from taking damage. No armour will "
"will protect you from all damage but it will all help protect you from some damage.  Most "
"armour will autoload for you after certain levels.  There is no way to tell at what level "
"armour will autoload for you so you should take care when buying armour to have the shop "
"owner %^CYAN%^<show>%^RESET%^ you the armour.  This will tell you if the armour will autoload for you.  If "
"something will not autoload, it will vanish when you quit the game.  There are several "
"differen't types of armour but you can only wear one of each type.  The different kinds "
"of armour are: Helmet, Gloves, Boots, Shirt, Pants, Hat, Bracers, Tunic, Jacket, "
"Chainmail, Leggings, Necklace, Ring, Bracelet, Robes, and Body Armour.  As you are a "
"newbie you should have a helmet, chainmail, and boots unless you are one of the races that "
"has more than two legs, in which case you have race specific armour.  You should find more "
"armour to compliment what you are wearing and make yourself more protected as you can.  "
"Make sure you type %^CYAN%^<wear all>%^RESET%^ before you begin to adventure forth and fight "
"monsters.  There is an armour shop in Tirun go north, west, and north from the square "
"to get there.\n\n"
"%^CYAN%^[ Weapons ]%^RESET%^\n"
"Weapons in the game are used to make your melee attacks stronger.  To wield and use a "
"weapon you must have the appropriate skill for the weapon you wish to use.  There are "
"serveral types of weapons in the game.  The different types of weapons are: Axe, Blade, "
"Blunt, Flail, Knife, Projectile, and Ranged.  Your skill in these weapons is listed under "
"%^CYAN%^<skills>%^RESET%^.  If you try to wield a weapon and a message tells you 'You do "
"not have the talent to use this.' it means your skill in that type of weapon is to low.  "
"What class and subclass you choose will determine how much skill you can have in each type "
"of weapon.  Certain weapons will not autoload until you reach certain levels and there is "
"no way to determine when something will autoload.\n"
"As a newbie you do not start with a weapon but Rejik the peddler, who hangs out right "
"near the square, sells newbie weapons for 1 gold coin.  There is also a weapon shop in "
"Tirun to get there go north, west and west from the square.  During combat a weapon will "
"decay, which means it becomes worn out. There is a weaponsmith in Tirun who will fix "
"weapons for a price.  He is located in the southwest part of the city.\n"
"Before venturing forth to explore and kill monsters you should make sure to %^CYAN%^<wield>%^RESET%^ "
"a weapon or two. If you have trouble wielding weapons you should try <weild weapon 1 in right hand> "
"and <wield weapon 2 in left hand> or first, second, third, forth hand depending on your "
"race.\n\n"
"%^CYAN%^[ Other items ]%^RESET%^\n"
"There are other items in the game which can speed up or enhance your adventuring.  Some items such "
"as healing oil, drinks, and ointment are used to cure hit points, stamina points, and "
"body damage; stones are used to replenish mana points; seals and wax are used to transport "
"you from one place to another; torches and lanterns are used for light. The list of items "
"and magic items is long so we will not go into all of them or where they are all located.  "
"A few places to check would be the Tirun general store located north, west, northwest from "
"the square; the healer shop south, east, south from the square; Lars' Tavern located "
"south, east, and east from the square.  Stones are located in a little town called Arlon "
"which is south out of Tirun and east along the beach.  There are many other items located "
"throughout the realms, to find them you will have to adventure forth and explore.\n\n"

"%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^[ Picking a class ]%^RESET%^\n"
"The first thing you should decide is what class you would like to be a part of.  The "
"classes are: Clergy, Fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Wanderer.  First you must find a class "
"hall and %^CYAN%^<become>%^RESET%^ a member of that class.  Once you have joined a class you will have "
"to find a subclass hall of that class and %^CYAN%^<become>%^RESET%^ a member of that subclass.  Some class "
"halls and subclass halls are hidden and have to be searched out and found before you can "
"join them, others are located throughout Tirun in buildings just off the roads.\n"
"Once you have chosen what path you shall follow, you can use the commands %^CYAN%^<spells>%^RESET%^ "
"or %^CYAN%^<abilities>%^RESET%^ to see what custom commands you have to use.  You also "
"have custom %^CYAN%^<skills>%^RESET%^ that are determined by your class and subclass.  The "
"cost of your stats and skils is also dependant on your class and subclass.  Physical "
"classes such as Fighter and Rogue are more stat based than skill based.  Mage and Clergy "
"are more skill based than stat based.  Wanderers fall somewhere in the middle.  What "
"this means is, spells depend on skills more than stats and abilities depend on stats more "
"than skills.  All spells and abilities use both stats and skills but are custom made for "
"each subclass. So take this into account as you make your choice in what class and subclass "
"you wish to be.\n\n"

"%^CYAN%^%^BOLD%^[ Playing the game ]%^RESET%^\n"
"Playing PD is a different experience for each player.  There are many ways to make each "
"session of playing different but at some point you will run out of things to do.  So you "
"end up making repetitive kills on your climb to a level where you can explore again.  "
"While PD has alot to do, the mud is not super big in size yet, though we are working to "
"remedy that problem by building new areas and training new builders constantly.  The "
"realms grow nearly monthly and changes are happening on a weekly basis.\n"
"Included in this book is a basic map of the main town Tirun.  After you have chosen "
"your class and subclass, worn your equipment, wielded your weapons, bought all the extras "
"you may need, it is time to make some experience so you can begin to level your character "
"up, make it stronger, and gain new abilities and spells.  There are three ways to do this: "
"fighting monsters, doing quests, or getting a job. Lets discuss each of these and how to do"
" them.\n\n"
"%^CYAN%^[ Fighting monsters ]%^RESET%^\n"
"As a newbie you should know there is an area strictly for you to go and gain experience "
"in.  To fight a monster all you need do is find one and type kill monster.  The problem "
"with this is, if you kill every monster without knowing it's strength, evetually you will "
"die.  So let's go over a few commands that can help you to keep from attacking a monster "
"who can slaughter you in one round.  The first we need to discuss is consider. "
"%^CYAN%^<consider monster>%^RESET%^ will give a small amount of information on the "
"creature you consider.  Basically it will tell you how tough the monster will be for you "
"to kill without having to leave the room to heal and come back.  A message telling you "
"'You might die.' it means the monster is a few levels higher than you and will be a "
"tougher kill than 'A perfect match!' and a message like 'You shouldn't try to kill that "
"without some help.' means the monster is alot tougher than you and maybe you should not "
"attempt it without a party to help you out.  You can find out more information about a "
"party by typing %^CYAN%^<help party>%^RESET%^.  The other command that will help you "
"live longer is wimpy. Use %^CYAN%^<wimpy on 25>%^RESET%^ to turn wimpy on and make"
"yourself flee from battle when your hit point get below 25% of your total hit points. "
"Also remeber to set your %^CYAN%^<wimpydir direction>%^RESET%^ before begining a battle "
"with a tough monster so you will not try to flee in a direction that does not exist.  "
"See %^CYAN%^<help wimpy>%^RESET%^ for more information on this.\n"
"The newbie forest, which is an area made for newbies to kill in is north out of Tirun. "
"Once you come to the gates you will need to go north, north, northwest, north, north, "
"north, then to the east a few times untill you find a squirrel or chipmunk to kill.  As "
"the animals get larger there, so too do the get tougher. A bear is alot tougher than a "
"chipmunk, an opossum is a bit tougher than a squirrel, etc.  The newbie forest does connect"
" to the Tirun forest that surrounds the main town so you might want to use the %^CYAN%^<peer>%^RESET%^ "
"command to see into a room before going that way.  The newbie forest does not have any "
"rats and if you do see rats, you are no longer in the newbie forest and might think about "
"backtracking back to the newbie area.\n\n"
"%^CYAN%^[ Doing quests ]%^RESET%^\n"
"There are a few quests and mini quests in PD.  To find out more about a quest, while you "
"are in your class or sublcass hall type list.  This will give you a list of quests "
"availible in the game.  The referances to the quests are vague and you have to do a "
"little work to find and complete the quests.  Mini quests are not listed anywhere and most "
"are found by exploration.  Almost every town has a mini quest or two to do so make sure "
"you explore everything throughly if you are intent on finding them all.  Quests and mini "
"quest can reward you with various things. most of the time the reward is in the form of "
"experience but other things can be awarded as well, such as a new race, a new item, gold, "
"etc.\n\n"
"%^CYAN%^[ Finding a job ]%^RESET%^\n"
"Pd has a small delivery service in which players can go to a warehouse located on the "
"docks and %^CYAN%^<accept job>%^RESET%^.  The headmaster of the delivery service will "
"give you a package to deliver to one of the store owners in Tirun.  You must find the "
"store owner and %^CYAN%^<give>%^RESET%^ the package to the store owner that was named "
"when you accepted the job.  All deliveries are timed so you do not have alot of time to "
"look for the store owners.  Once you deliver your package the store owner will reward "
"you with some gold and you will get a bit of experience for doing the job, if you are on "
"time.  The store owner will also give you a recipet.  You must return the reciept to the "
"headmaster.  If you were on time, you will be able to accept another job, if you were "
"late the headmaster will not let you work for him until the next day.\n\n"
"There are lots of other variables included in playing PD and muds in general, alot of "
"commands were not mentioned in this guide because to mention and explain them all would "
"take to much time and since they are already explained in the help system we hope you "
"will take your time to read and learn about all the great things PD has to offer a player "
"in your quest for entertainment.  Thanks for playing Primal Darkness and we hope this "
"guide has helped you in learning more about playing and shall help you in the future as "
"you use the map to find your way around.\n\n"
