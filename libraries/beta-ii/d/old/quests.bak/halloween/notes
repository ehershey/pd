hp:760|sp:386|mp:1360 >  reply nope
You reply to Leviathas: nope

Leviathas replies: East:  You look over the female witch.
East is not an ugly witch, but rather beautiful.  Where she excells in her
physical qualities, she lacks in intelligence and wisdom.  East is the
weakest
of the four witches, though to underestimate her could prove fatal -she is
one
of the four strongest monsters this world has yet seen.

Leviathas says: east, the stupid witch, will give up the secret by saying
something like "D'uh...  I better not let you get all the broomsticks,
then the arch witch would be mad."
Leviathas says: sound good?

Leviathas says: there could be Glenda, the good witch that gives the start
of
the quest
