The battlefields are located in ~powerman directory 
One forest near Helgrath is located in ~detach/forbiden directory 
Some weapons and armour in play are located in ~detach/azeria/obj directory
Darkmouth caverns in Roston is located in ~detach/darkmouth directory
 
All these things need a header file done sometime and their own directory added
to /d
 
These are directories that are not in use:
aciri, citrin.old, house(??), lca, nemar, quests.bak, radyne, shadow.bak,
tombar, vswamp(??)

You can't change anything in the metaisland directory because root was given to ftp. If there is a problem or bug in metaisland area, post it on stormbringer's board so he can fix it through ftp.
