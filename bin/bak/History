As many of the greatest poems are written when
your love dumps you, this program was written
when a company turned down my job application.

It was written in just a couple of hours in the
middle of october 1996. It has been improved
several times after the first version.

It was erased during a clumsily done system upgrade,
and angrily reconstructed from an older version.

I now hate ange-ftp and its total dependency on
existing ftp-servers and /bin/ls, and because its
programmers haven't looked at RFC959. Ok, I don't
follow it completely either.

It has now been used for almost a year in NannyMUD.
one of the oldest LPMUDs in the world. A mud which
I started in late April 1990.
