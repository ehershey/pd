# If you add the following entry to your crontab:

# 36 4 * * * ~/zscript/backup
# (assuming this is installed in ~/zscript/backup)
#
# then this script will back up your lib daily into different files.
# The monthly will be hard link (therefore taking no extra disk space),
# but the link is "broken" at the turn of the month; essentially, it
# will drop off a copy each month.  This system provides for restoring
# from up to a few days and for long term archival.
